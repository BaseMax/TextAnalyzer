[CAR HORNS HONKING]

2
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

3
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

4
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

5
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

6
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

7
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl. Oh.

8
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

9
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

10
Sounds like a date to me.

11
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

12
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
- Oh, yeah.
- I've had that dream.

14
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

15
...there.

16
- Instead of...
- That's right!

17
MONICA: That one, I've never had.
PHOEBE: No.

18
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

19
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

21
Hi.

22
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

23
Are you okay, sweetie?

24
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

25
...and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

26
Carol moved her stuff out today.

27
PHOEBE & JOEY:
Oh.

28
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

29
Ew. Unh.

30
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

31
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

32
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

33
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

34
To hell with her. She left me!

35
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

36
No! Okay?

37
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

38
She didn't know. How should I know?

39
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

40
Did I say that out loud?

41
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

42
You're angry. You're hurting.

43
Can I tell you what the answer is?

44
Strip joints!

45
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

46
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

47
I just wanna be married again.

48
And I just want a million dollars!

49
Rachel?

50
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

51
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

52
...that you might be here, and you are.

53
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

54
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

55
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

56
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

57
- Sure!
- Hey.

58
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

59
[SIGHS]

60
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

61
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

62
I was in this room
with all the presents...

63
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

64
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

65
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

66
- I realized...

67
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

68
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

69
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

70
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

71
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

72
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

73
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

74
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

75
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

76
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

77
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH
ON TV]

78
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ...

79
...and she's really not
happy about it.

80
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

81
I'm sorry.

82
I just don't love him.

83
Well, it matters to me.

84
CHANDLER:
She should not be wearing those pants.

85
I say push her down the stairs.

86
ALL: Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

87
[ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD]

88
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

89
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

90
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

91
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

92
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

93
Or a hat?"

94
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

95
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
You can see where he'd have trouble.

97
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

98
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

99
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

100
Well, maybe that's my decision.

101
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

102
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

103
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

104
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

105
[SINGING] Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

106
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

107
La la la something
With string

108
I'm all better now.

109
I helped.

110
MONICA: Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

111
Independence. Taking control of your life.

112
And, hey, if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

113
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

114
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

115
What? Like there's a rule or something?

116
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

117
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

118
PAUL: Uh, it's Paul.
- Buzz him in.

119
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

120
Maybe.

121
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

122
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes.

123
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

124
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

125
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

126
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

127
That'd be good.

128
- Really?
- No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

129
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

130
MONICA:
Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

131
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

132
JOEY:
Paul, the wine guy.

133
- Wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

134
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
- Okay.

135
[MOUTHING]

136
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

137
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

138
Well, I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

139
...so, nothing.

140
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

141
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
This time of year? Eh.

142
Talk about your...

143
...big lizards.

144
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

145
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

146
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

147
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

148
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

149
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

150
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

151
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

152
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

153
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

154
...and I cannot feel my legs.

155
What's this?

156
I have no idea.

157
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

158
This was Carol's favorite beer.

159
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

160
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

161
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

162
What did you get?

163
You guys.

164
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- You got screwed.

165
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

166
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

167
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

168
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

169
How did you get through it?

170
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

171
- Say her...
- Leg?

172
Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

173
Me, I went for the watch.

174
- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

175
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

176
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

177
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

178
[SIGHS]

179
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

180
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

181
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

182
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

183
What are you talking about?
One woman.

184
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

185
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

186
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

187
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

188
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

189
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

190
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

191
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

192
Then stay out of my freezer.

193
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

194
What? What?

195
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

196
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

197
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

198
Isn't there?

199
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

200
What were you gonna say?

201
Well... Er, uh...

202
Ever since she left me, um...

203
...I haven't been able to perform...

204
...sexually.

205
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...

206
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

207
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

208
Um...

209
How long?

210
Two years.

211
Wow!

212
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

213
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

214
Yeah.

215
Yeah, I do.

216
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

217
MINISTER: Do you take Joanie...?
- Oh! See.

218
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

219
"Grab a spoon."

220
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

221
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

222
You know, here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough...

223
...to ask a woman out...

224
...who am I gonna ask?

225
Isn't this amazing?

226
I mean, I have never made coffee
before in my life.

227
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

228
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you
gotta make a Western omelet or something...

229
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

230
- Good morning.
MONICA: Good morning.

231
- Morning.
JOEY: Morning.

232
- Morning.
JOEY: Morning, Paul.

233
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

234
MONICA:
I had a really great time last night.

235
PAUL:
Thank you. Thank you so much.

236
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Yeah.

237
Thank you.

238
That wasn't a real date.

239
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

240
- Shut up and put my table back.
JOEY: Okay.

241
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

242
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

243
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

244
Yeah, we all have jobs.

245
See, that's how we buy stuff.

246
Yeah, I'm an actor.

247
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

248
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

249
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

250
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

251
I will not take this abuse.

252
You're right. I'm sorry.

254
MONICA: So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

255
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

256
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

257
I know. He's just so...

258
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

259
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, it's like that. With feelings.

260
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

261
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work...

262
...and not think about him all day.

263
Or else I'm just gonna
get up and go to work.

264
- Oh, wish me luck!
- What for?

265
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

266
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

267
How was Florida?

268
You had sex, didn't you?

269
How do you do that?

270
- So, who?
- You know Paul?

271
Paul, the wine guy?

272
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

273
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

274
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

275
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

276
Of course it was a line.

277
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

278
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

279
"To get you into bed."

280
Is it me?

281
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

282
...and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

283
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

284
I just thought he was nice, you know?

285
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

286
Guess what.

287
- You got a job?
- Are you kidding?

288
I'm trained for nothing.

289
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

290
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

291
Well, you would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

292
...50 percent off.

293
Oh, how well you know me.

294
They're my new "I don't need
a job or my parents.

295
I've got great boots" boots.

296
- How'd you pay for them?
- Uh, credit card.

297
And who pays for that?

298
Um, my father.

299
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

300
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

301
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

302
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

303
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

304
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

305
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

306
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields...

307
...outside Port Authority.
And then he killed himself.

308
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

309
The word you're looking for is:

310
"Anyway..."

311
All right. You ready?

312
- I don't think so.

- No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

321
Yeah.

Look what I just found on the floor.

323
What?

- Split it?

333
- Okay.
- Okay.

334
Thanks.

335
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

336
...a major crush on you.

337
I knew.

338
You did? Oh.

339
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

340
- I did.
- Oh.

341

342
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

343
Do you think it would be okay if
I ask you out sometime, maybe?

That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

5
No. No, I don't.

Oh, he is precious.
Where did you get him?

7
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

8
That is so cruel.

9
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

10
Hey, that monkey's got a Ross
on his ass.

11
Ross, is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

12
Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so...

13
Why don't you just get a roommate?

14
Ah, I don't know.
You reach a certain age...

15
...having a roommate
is just kind of pathe...

16
Uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is Sanskrit
for "really cool way to live."

You guys,
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

You don't have to face
the horrible pressures of this holiday...

to find anything with lips...

37
...just so can have somebody to kiss
when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud.

38
Well, for your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

39
So I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

40
Yeah, you wish.

41
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick Clark holiday.

42
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.

43
Just the six of us. Dinner.

- Sure.
- Fine.

for a little more enthusiasm.

- And sometimes when it's freezing
DAVID: I'm being honest here.

62
You don't agree.

63
- I feel a little sneezy
MAX: You're right.

64
And now I...
Excuse me? Excuse me?

65
Yeah, noisy boys.

66
Is it something that you'd like
to share with the group?

67
No. No, that's okay.

68
Come on, if it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing...

69
...then I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

70
That guy's going home with a note.

71
[CLEARS THROAT]

72
- Nothing. I was just saying...
- Could you speak up?

73
Sorry.

74
I was just saying to my friend, you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

75
- And you said Daryl Hannah...
- Darryl Hannah.

76
...was the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever seen in his life.

77
And I said, yeah, I liked her in Splash,
but not so much in Wall Street.

78
- I thought she had a hard quality.
- A hard quality.

79
And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way...

80
...you are, uh, luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

81
Then that's when you started yelling.

82
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

83
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

84
ROSS:
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

85
[MARCEL CHATTERING]

86
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

87
I mean, God, by my sixth date
with Paolo...

88
...I mean, he had already named
both my breasts.

89
Ooh, did I just share too much?

90
Just a smidge.

91
David's, like, you know, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

92
- I think it's romantic.
- Me too. Oh!

93
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

94
MONICA:
Yeah.

95
Well, he's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

96
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

97
Except...

98
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

99
I just... I just want to be with him
all the time.

100
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

101
And special occasions.

102
Wait a minute. I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

103
You're gonna break the pact.
She's gonna break the pact.

104
No, no, no.

105
Yeah, could I just?

106
- Yeah, because I already asked Janice.
RACHEL: You what?

107
Come on, this was a pact.
This was your pact.

108
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle
the pressure and I snapped.

109
Yeah, but Janice?
That was, like, the worst breakup in history.

110
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I'm saying I snapped.

111
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

112
Too many jokes.

113
Must mock Joey.

114
Nice shoes, huh?

115
Aah, you're killing me.

116
Ross.
He's playing with my spatulas again.

117
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

118
Do you always have to bring him here?

119
Look, I didn't want to leave him alone,
all right?

120
We had our first fight this morning.

121
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

122
He threw some feces.

123
You know, if you're gonna work late,
I can look in on him for you.

124
Oh, that would be great. Okay.

125
But if you do, make sure it seems
like you're there to see him, okay?

126
And you're not, like, doing it
as a favor to me.

127
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

128
But you can't actually test this theory.

129
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough...

130
...to simulate these conditions.

131
- Okay. All right. I have a question then.
- Yeah.

132
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

133
Uh, that's definitely a valid question...

134
...and, uh, the answer...

135
...would be yes.

136
Yes, I was.

137
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss...

138
...that happened at this phenomenal
moment because, well, it's you.

139
Sure. Yeah.

140
Right. But, see, the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

141
And now, we've reached a place...

142
...where it's just got to be
one of those things where I...

143
...sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

144
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

145
Oh, David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.

146
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

147
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.

148
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me. Heh.

149
- Now? Now?
- Right now. Just...

150
Okay. Okay, okay.

151
[CHUCKLES]

152
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

153
Okay. And I'll tell you, this was a gift.

154
- So now you're just kind of tidying up.
- Okay, what the hell? What the hell?

155
[SHOUTS]

156
- You want me to actually throw you...?
- I can hop.

157
Now, tell me something, what does
the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?

158
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

159
It's just that Chandler has somebody
and Phoebe has somebody.

160
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

161
- Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend, Fun Bobby?
- Yeah.

162
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

163
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

164
Okay. Here we go.

165
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no room for milk.

166
There. Now there is.

167
Okay, so on our no-date evening...

168
...three of you now
are gonna have dates.

169
- Uh, four.
- Four.

170
- Five.
- Five.

171
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

172
Yeah, and I met this really hot
single mom at the store. Ha, ha.

173
What's an elf to do?

174
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one
standing there alone...

175
...when the ball drops?

176
Oh, come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

177
Hey, you know,
this is so not what I needed now.

178
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's Marcel.

179
He keeps shutting me out, you know?

180
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

181
That's so weird. I had such a blast
with him the other night.

182
- Really?
- Yeah, we played. We watched TV.

183
That juggling thing is amazing.

184
What, uh?

185
What juggling thing?

186
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

187
No.

188
You know, it wasn't that big a deal.
I mean, just balled-up socks.

189
And a melon.

190
- Phoebe. Hi.
- Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

191
No. Have you seen David?

192
No, he hasn't been around.

193
Well, if you see him, tell him
to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

194
- Minsk?
- Minsk. It's in Russia.

195
I know where Minsk is.

196
Ha, ha. We got the grant.

197
Three years, all expenses paid.

198
So when do you leave?

199
January 1 st.

200
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

201
Hello?

202
- Hey. Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

203
- What are you doing here?
- Um, well, Max told me about Minsk.

204
So you know, congratulations.
This is so exciting!

205
MAX:
Yeah.

206
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

207
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

208
Tell her, David.

209
"I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

210
No, no, no. I want to stay here
and make out with my girlfriend."

211
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

212
So you're really not going?

213
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just...

214
You decide.

215
- Oh, don't do that.
- Please?

216
No, but I'm asking you.
I can't make a decision.

217
- I can't. Please, just...
- Okay. Stay.

218
- Stay.
- Stay.

219
Getting so good at that.

220
It was Max's stuff.

221
[R.E.M.'S "SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE"
PLAYING]

222
I love this artichoke thing.

223
Oh, don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

224
[LAUGHING NASALLY]

225
You remember Janice.

226
Vividly.

227
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

228
MONICA: Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

229
Sandy, hi. Come on in. Hey.

230
Ha, ha.

231
- You brought your kids.
- Yeah. That's okay, right?

232
Party.

233
That thing is not coming in here.

234
"That thing"? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

235
Let me ask you something.
If I showed up with my new girlfriend...

236
...she wouldn't be welcome?

237
I'm thinking your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

238
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

239
Okay? And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here...

240
...like nothing happened...

241
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

242
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

243
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

244
All right, I'll, uh, catch up with you later.

245
Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey...

246
...are you okay? Where's Paolo?

247
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

248
And then your face exploded?

249
No. Okay.

250
I was at the airport getting into a cab...

251
...when this woman...

252
...this blond planet with a pocketbook...

253
...starts yelling at me.

254
Something about how
it was her cab first.

255
And the next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair.

256
And I started blowing
my attack whistle thingy...

257
...and then three more cabs show up.

258
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me.

259
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

260
Oh! Everybody having fun at the party?

261
Are people eating my dip?

262
You know, when I saw you
at the store last week...

263
...it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

264
Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

265
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

266
Hey, kids.

267
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me...

268
...but at least check in.

269
There you are.

270
You got away from me.

271
But you found me.

272
Here, Ross, take our picture.

273
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

274
[LAUGHING NASALLY]

275
Kill me. Kill me now. Ha, ha.

276
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

277
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

278
ALL:
Fun Bobby!

279
MONICA:
Hey, Bobby.

280
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my, uh, grandfather...

281
...died about two hours ago.

282
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so...

283
...here I am.

284
Hey, Fun Bobby. How's it going, man?

285
Whoa. Who died?

286
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

287
So at least I'll get to see him again.

288
[SOBBING]

289
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write "Reunited" in glitter.

290
All right, Janice, that's it!

291
Janice? Janice? Ahem.

292
Hey, Janice?

293
When I invited you to this party,
I didn't think it meant that we...

294
Oh, no.

295
- I'm sorry you misunderstood.
- Oh, my God.

296
You listen to me, Chandler.
You listen to me.

297
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me.

298
Oh, will you give me the thing?

299
- Hi, Max.
- Yoko.

300
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

301
Wow.

302
MAX:
It won't be the same...

303
...but it will still be Minsk.

304
Happy New Year.

305
Are you all right?

306
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

307
You're going to Minsk.

308
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

309
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

310
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just because of me.

311
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

312
- And I can't break up with you.
- Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

313
Just say, uh, "Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

314
And that's what I have to do right now."

315
And I say, "Your work? Your work?
How can you say that?"

316
And then you say, um,
"It's tearing me apart...

317
...but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"

318
And I say, "No.
No. I can't understand that."

319
- Uh, ow.
- Sorry. Um...

320
And then you put
your arms around me...

321
- And then you put your arms around me.
- Oh, oh. Sorry.

322
And, um... And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

323
I'll never forget you.

324
And then you say that it's almost midnight
and you have to go...

325
...because you don't want to start
the new year with me if you can't finish it.

326
I'm gonna miss you...

327
...you scientist guy.

328
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

329
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

330
It gets bigger and better every year.

331
Here you go, kids.

332
And then the peacock bit me. Ha, ha.

333
Please kiss me at midnight.

334
- You seen Sandy?
- Ooh. I don't know how to tell you this...

335
...but, uh, she's in Monica's bedroom
getting it on with Max, that scientist geek.

336
Oh, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

337
[MUMBLING]
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

338
GROUP:
What?

339
The ball is dropping.

340
CLARK [ON TV]:
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

341
And the moment of joy is upon us.

342
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

343
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

344
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

345
[SOBBING]

346
GROUP:
One. Happy New Year!

347
You know, I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz...

348
...but I do believe there are three girls
and three guys right here.

349
Oh, I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

350
I can't kiss anyone.

351
So I'm kissing everyone?

352
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

353
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

354
All right. Somebody kiss me.

355
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

356
All right. All right. All right.

357
There.

358
I wanted this to work so much.

359
I'm still in there, you know?

360
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

361
But he's just phoning it in.

362
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much...

363
...doesn't love you back, you know?

364
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

﻿1
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
MONICA: Why?
- I just wanna check my horoscope...

3
...see if it was right.

4
Oh, my God. Phoebe. Don't look now,
but, behind you there's a guy...

5
...who has the potential to break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

6
Where?

7
Ooh, come to Mama.

8
Okay, he's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

9
- Nice hat.
BOTH: Thanks.

10
- We should do something. Whistle.
- We're not gonna whistle.

11
- Yeah, come on, do it.
- No.

12
- Do it. Do it. Do it.
- Woo-hoo!

13
[AMBULANCE SIRENS WAILING]

14
[TIRES SQUEALING THEN THUD]

15
I can't believe you did that.

16
MONICA:
Why did I woo-hoo?

17
I mean, what was I hoping?
He'd turn around and say:

18
"Ooh, I love that sound.
I must have you now"?

19
I just wish there was something
we could do.

20
[EKG BEEPING]

21
Hello. Hello, coma guy.

22
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

23
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Maybe nobody's tried this.

24
I wish we at least knew his name.

25
Would you look at that face?

26
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

27
Yeah, but did you see the dents
in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.

28
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

29
And he can dance.

30
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening...

31
...you know, and not saying,
"Yeah, I understand"...

32
...but wondering what you look like naked.
- Oh, stop it.

33
I wish all guys could be like him.

34
I know.

35
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

36
- He doesn't have anyone.
- Yeah. We feel kind of responsible.

37
I can't believe you said, "Woo-hoo."

38
I don't even say, "Woo-hoo."

39
Oh, she's coming up. She's coming up.

40
Folks, when we come back...

41
...we'll talk about her new book
Euphoria Unbound...

42
...with always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
Put the kids to bed for this one.

43
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO and Cinemex.

44
- No way.
- Come on. She's your mom.

45
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

46
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

47
- No?
- Chandler, I gotta tell you...

48
...I love your mom's books.
I love her books.

49
I cannot get on a plane without one.
I mean, this is so cool.

50
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 11...

51
...and all your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

52
Come on, Chandler. I love your mom.
I think she's a blast.

53
- You can say that. She's not your mom.
ROSS: Oh, please. She's the...

54
RACHEL:
Hi, sweetie.

55
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

56
- Last night.
- Really?

57
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

58
Just a dream I had.

59
But, phew.

60
Hey, hey, hey. She's on.

61
Ah. Nora Bing.

62
Before we get to the book.

63
What is this about you being arrested
in London? What is that about?

64
- Your mom was arrested?
- Shh, I'm busy beaming with pride.

65
This is kind of embarrassing...

66
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

67
- Why would she say that's embarrassing?
- Shh.

68
- I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

69
That's too much information.

70
So now you're doing this book tour thing.
How's that going?

71
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

72
But I get to see my son, who I love.

73
GROUP:
Oh.

74
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

75
You know, don't take this wrong,
I just don't see you as a mom somehow.

76
- I don't mean that bad.
- Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

77
I bought my son his first condoms.

78
And then he burst into flames.

debating a new deficit-reduction bill.

subway fares again.

- He could be a Glen.
- Mm-mm. Not special enough.

Way too special.

89
I'm famished. What do I want?

90
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

91
Oh, you watched the show.
What did you think?

92
Well, I think you need
to come out of your shell just...

93
What is this dive?

94
- Only you could've picked this place.
- Oh.

95
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

96
- Hi.
NORA: Give me a hug.

97
- Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
- I know I am.

98
- Who's doing shots?
- Hit me.

99
- I'm in.
- There you go. Ross?

100
Uh, I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

101
Hi. Sorry. Sorry we're late.

102
We, uh, kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

103
But a man can change.

104
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

105
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you,
I've read everything you've ever written.

106
No, I mean it.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight...

107
...all I wanted to do was become a writer.

108
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

109
You just start with half a dozen
European cities...

110
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...

111
...and, bam, you have got yourself
a book.

112
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

113
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

114
- You okay, slugger?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

115
What is with you tonight?

116
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

117
NORA:
Okay, thank you.

118
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

119
No. It's the one he's licking.

120
She's supposed to be with you.

121
You're good.

122
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold
100 million copies of my books...

123
...and you know why?

124
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

125
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

126
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

127
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

128
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.

129
He's just a... You know, a complication
you eventually kill off.

130
When?

131
He's not a hero.

132
You know who our hero is?

133
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

134
No, it's you.

135
- Please.
- No, really.

136
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

137
- Right.
- Oh, come on, kiddo.

138
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

139
Uh-oh.

140
Uh, I'll just pee in the street.

141
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

142
Is Chandler here?

143
- Yeah.
- Wait. Come here.

144
Okay, uh, about last night...

145
...um, you know...

146
...Chandler. You didn't tell...

147
Okay, I'm thinking
we don't need to tell Chandler.

148
It was just a kiss. One kiss.
No big deal, right?

149
- Right. No big deal.
- Okay.

150
In Bizarro-world.

151
You broke the code.

152
- What code?
- You don't kiss your friend's mom.

153
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

154
But not a mom. Never a mom.

155
[ALL SHOUTING]

156
What are you guys doing out here?

157
Uh, well, Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

158
But, um,
apparently somebody overslept.

159
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

160
No. No, I don't,
because it's being restrung.

161
Ahem. Somebody was supposed
to bring me one.

162
Yeah. Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

163
Okay, you guys are spending
way too much time together.

164
Okay, I'm scum. I'm scum.

165
- Ross, how could you let this happen?
- I don't know.

166
Well, it's not like she's a regular mom.
You know? She's sexy. She's...

167
You don't think my mom's sexy?

168
Well, not in the same way.

169
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani...

170
...was a handsome woman in her day,
all right?

171
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

172
Huh?

173
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

174
- Aah.
- Hey.

175
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing out here?

176
Well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball.

177
- He forgot to leave his grip size.
- He didn't get the goggles.

178
Oh. Right.

179
Well, sounds like you two have issues.

180
Goodbye, baby.

181
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

182
Do they wait for me to do this?

183
- So are you gonna tell him?
- I'm not gonna tell him.

184
- Why would I tell him?
- How about, because if you don't...

185
...his mother might?
- Hmm.

186
What are you guys doing here?

187
Uh, he's not even wearing a jock strap.

188
What did I ask?

189
[EKG BEEPING]

190
- Hi.
- Hi.

191
What are you doing here?

192
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after the, ahem...

193
That I, you know.
Um, so, what are you doing here?

194
I'm not really here.

195
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

196
Do you, um, come here a lot...

197
...without me?

198
No, no, no.

199
So, um, do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

200
How would I know? I wasn't here.

201
Really? Not even to,
um, change his pajamas?

202
Oh, my God.

203
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

204
I can't believe it.

205
Paolo kissed my mom?

206
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

207
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk...

208
I can't do this. I did it.

209
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

210
What?

211
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I think I had too much tequila...

212
...and Nora... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

213
She was just being nice, you know?
But nothing happened.

214
Nothing. Ask Joey. Joey came in...

215
- You knew about this?
- Uh...

216
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

217
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

218
Hey, hey. You're lucky
I caught them when I did...

219
...or else who knows
what would've happened?

220
Thanks, man. Big help.

221
I can't believe this.
What the hell were you thinking?

222
I wasn't. I don't know. I...

223
Of all my friends, no one knows the crap
I go through with my mom more than you.

224
- I know.
- I can't believe you did this.

225
- Me neither.
- I'm mad at you for not telling me.

226
- What are you mad at me...?
- Let me slam the door.

227
Chandler, I didn't kiss her. He did.

228
See what happens
when you break the code?

229
- Joey.
- Aah! Uh.

230
- Rach.
- Hey.

231
"A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Green."

232
Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm still on the first chapter.

233
Now, do you think his "love stick"
can be "liberated from its denim prison"?

234
Yeah, I'd say so.

235
And there's no "J" in "engorged."

236
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

237
- Hello.
- Hello.

238
- You going to the hospital tonight?
- No. You?

239
No. You?

240
You just asked me.

241
Okay, maybe it was a trick question.

242
- Um, Rachel, can we do this now?
- Okay.

243
I am so hot.

244
And here's a picture of my mother
and father on their wedding day.

245
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

246
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

247
Come on, just try to picture her
not pregnant. That's all.

248
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

249
[CROWD CHEERING]

250
PHOEBE:
Thanks.

251
Hi. Um, ahem. Okay.

252
I'd like to start with a song
that's about a man I recently met...

253
...who's, um, come to be
very important to me.

254
Okay.

255
[SINGING] You don't have to be awake
To be my man

256
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

257
Though we just met the other day

258
There's something I have got to say

259
Okay, thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

260
RACHEL: Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay,
everybody. Whoo!

261
- What the hell was that?
- Phoebe just started...

262
I believe I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

263
[LAUGHING]

264
"Mother-kisser."

265
I'll shut up.

266
Chandler, can I say something?
I know you're still mad at me.

267
I just wanna say that there were
two people there that night, okay?

268
- There were two sets of lips.
- Yes, well, I expect this from her.

269
Okay? She's always been
a Freudian nightmare.

270
Okay, but if she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

271
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

272
Hey, you kissed my mom.

273
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

274
- That's funny. We done now?
- No.

275
Okay, you mean you're not gonna
talk to her, tell her how you feel?

276
That would be a no. Just because
you played tonsil tennis with my mom...

277
...doesn't mean you know her, all right?
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

278
Okay. "You can't"? Or you can't?

279
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.

280
Still doing the play.

281
[SHOUTS THEN HUMS]

282
All right, what did you do with him?

283
[TOILET FLUSHES]

284
- You're awake.
- Look at you.

285
How do you feel?

286
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

287
Gosh, you look good.

288
I feel good.

289
Who are you?

290
- Sorry.
- I'm Phoebe Buffay.

291
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

292
We both have.

293
- So the Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
- Actually, it's just from me.

294
- Yeah, I got you the foot massager.
- Know who shaved you? That was me.

295
- I read to you.
- I sang. Ha.

296
Well, thanks.

297
- Oh, my pleasure.
- You're welcome.

298
So I guess I'll see you around.

299
What? That's it?

300
"See you around"?

301
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Well, I don't know.

302
Maybe, uh:

303
"That was nice.

304
It meant something to me.

305
I'll call you."

306
- All right. I'll call you.
- I don't think you mean that.

307
This is so typical.

308
You know, we give...

309
...and we give...

310
...and we give.

311
And then we just get nothing back.

312
And then one day, it's just, you know,
you wake up and "See you around."

313
Let's go, Phoebe.

314
You know what?
We thought you were different.

315
But I guess it was just the coma.

316
NORA:
The car's running downstairs.

317
I wanted to drop off these copies
of my book for your friends.

318
- Anything you want from Lisbon?
- No, just knowing you're there is enough.

319
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

320
You kissed my best Ross.

321
Or something to that effect.

322
Okay.

323
Look, it was stupid.

324
- Really stupid.
- Really stupid.

325
And I don't even know how it happened.

326
I'm sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.

327
- Are we okay now?
- Yeah.

328
No. No.

329
Ah, the forbidden love
of a man and his door.

330
Shh.

331
He did it. He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything.

332
- You're kidding?
- No.

333
He said, "When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?"

334
- Wow.
- Wait, then she came back with:

335
"The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

336
Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say:

337
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?"

338
- That makes more sense.
- You think?

339
Yeah.

340
So, what's going on now?

341
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

342
I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

343
What do you see?

344
It's hard to tell.
They're so tiny and upside down.

345
Wait, wait, wait.

346
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

347
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

348
You okay, kiddo?

349
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right. You be good.

350
Drive safe.

351
[CHUCKLES]

352
- Mrs. Bing.
- Mr. Geller.

353
Hey.

354
You mean that?

355
Yeah, why not?

356
- So I told her.
- Oh.

357
- How did it go?
- Awful. Awful.

358
Couldn't have gone worse.

359
- Well, how do you feel?
- Pretty good.

360
I told her.

361
Well, see?

362
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

363
But we don't have to go down that road.

364
Now, this is just the first chapter...

365
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

366
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

367
What's a "niffle"?

368
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

369
All right, all right,
so I'm not a great typist.

370
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

371
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

372
- All right, that's it. Give them back.
GROUP: No.

All I'm saying is,
if you had told me vegetarian lasagna...

...I would've made vegetarian lasagna.

Well, the meat's only every third layer.

10
Maybe you could scrape.

11
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

12
Yep. You could plunk me down in
the middle of any woman's uterus...

13
...no compass...

14
...and I could find my way out like that.

Ooh, this is cool.

Shouldn't it be...

I've only read about...

I'm just totally, totally...

64
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

65
I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.

66
So I got the results of the amnio today.

No, no, no.

I have to buy a new one?

111
That's the rule.

112
What rule? There's no rule.

113
If anything, you owe me a table.

114
- How did you get there?
- I believe this piece of furniture was fine...

115
...until your little breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

116
You knew about that?

117
The impressions you made
in the butter...

118
...left little to the imagination.

119
Okay, okay. How about if we split it?

120
What do you mean, like, buy it together?

121
Yeah.

122
Do you think we're ready
for something like that?

123
- Why not?
- Well, it's just a big commitment.

124
I mean, what if one of us
wants to move out?

125
- Why, are you moving out?
- I'm not moving out.

126
You'd tell me if you were moving out,
right?

127
- Yes, it's just that, with my last roommate...
- Oh, I know all about Kip.

128
We bought a hibachi together,
and then he ran off and got married...

129
...and things got pretty ugly.

130
So let me ask you something.

131
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

132
Oh, don't do that.

133
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

134
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

Oh.

Okay, I don't know what you just said,
so let's just start.

147
Uh, I am, uh...

148
...being naked?

149
Um, that's really your decision.

150
I mean, some people prefer,
you know, to take off...

151
Ooh, oops! Being naked.

152
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I mean, I could not know.

153
I mean, if the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows...

154
And Monica knows.

155
Heh. How could you?
I don't even know.

156
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna.
I asked. She told me.

157
So, what's it going to be?

158
Whoa.

159
Huh? Oh, great.
Now he knows and I don't know.

I'm sorry. I'm just excited
about being an aunt.

161
Or an uncle.

162
GROUP:
Hey, Phoebe. Hey, Pheebs.

163
Fine.

164
- Phoebe, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

165
I'm just... I'm out of sorts.

166
Hey, can we get
some cappuccino over here?

167
Oh, right. That's me.

168
Hey, Chandler.
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

169
Fine.

170
Phoebe. What is it?

171
- You know Paolo?
- I'm familiar with his work, yes.

172
Look, he made a move on me.

173
- Whoa. The store will be open tomorrow.
- More coffee over here, please.

174
Well, what happened?

175
Well, he came in for a massage...

176
...and everything was fine until...

177
[GROUP GROANING]

178
- My God.
- Are you sure?

179
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

180
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

181
Was it?

182
Oh, Boy Scouts
could've camped under there.

183
GROUP:
Ooh.

184
- "Ooh," what?
- Ma Thurman.

185
- Oh.
- The actress.

186
Uma Thurman!

187
Thanks, Rach.

188
- What are you gonna you do?
- You have to tell her.

189
You have to tell her.
It's your moral obligation as a friend...

190
...as a woman. I think it's a feminist issue.
Guys? Guys?

191
Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

192
Feminist issue? That's where I went.

193
She is gonna hate me.

194
Yeah, well.

195
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

196
Here, how about that one?

197
That's patio furniture.

198
So what? Like people are gonna come in
and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again."

199
Fine.

200
What about the birds?

201
I don't know. Birds just don't say:

202
"Hello, sit here. Eat something."

203
You pick one.

204
How about the ladybugs?

205
Oh, so forget about the birds,
but big red insects suggest fine dining?

206
Fine. Do you want the birds?
Get the birds.

207
Not like that, I won't.

208
Kip would've liked the birds.

209
- Hey.
- Hi, Pheebs.

210
Are you moving out?

211
No, these aren't all of my suitcases.

212
This one's Paolo's.

213
Um...

214
Um, Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

215
Well, sure. Just for a sec, though...

216
...because Paolo's on his way over.
- Oh.

217
Okay. Um...

218
Okay.

219
Um...

220
- Oh, Pheebs...
- Um, okay.

221
Um, ahem. We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

222
And, um, there are three things
that you should know about me.

223
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

224
Two, I never lie.

225
And three, I make the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.

226
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

227
Mm, my God.

228
Why have I never tasted these before?

229
Oh, I don't make them a lot...

230
...because I don't think it's fair
to the other cookies.

231
Ahem, God.

232
Well, you're right. These are the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.

233
- Which proves that I never lie.
- I guess you don't.

234
Paolo made a pass at me.

235
So, what do you think?

236
I think it's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

237
I know.

238
So how does this work? Gonna balance
the plates on these little heads?

239
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on.

240
Heads up, Ross.

241
Score! You suck.

242
Are you okay?

243
I need some milk.

244
I've got milk.

245
Here you go.

246
Better?

247
No.

248
Ugh! I feel so stupid.

249
I think about the other day,
with you guys, you know.

250
And I was all,
"Oh, Paolo. He's so great.

251
He makes me feel so..." Ugh!

252
God.

253
I'm so embarrassed.

254
I'm the one he hit on.

255
I unleashed him on you.
If I'd never met him...

256
...this would've never happened.

257
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

258
BOTH:
No, I'm sorry.

259
Oh, wait. Oh.

260
- What are we sorry about?
- I don't know.

261
Right. He's the pig.

262
- Such a pig.
- Oh, God, he's such a pig.

263
- Oh, he's like a big disgusting pig...
- Yeah, like a...

264
- Pig man.
- Yes, good. Okay.

265
Oh, but he was my pig man.

266
How did I not see this?

267
Oh, I know!

268
Because...

269
...he's gorgeous.

270
And he's charming.

271
- And when he looks at you...
- Okay. Okay, Pheebs.

272
The end.

273
Ugh. God.

274
Should I not have told you?

275
No, trust me,
it's much better that I know.

276
Uh, I just liked it better before.
It was better.

277
I think she took it pretty well.

278
You know, Paolo's over there
right now, so...

279
Yeah, we should get over there
and see if she's okay.

280
Just one second.

281
- Whoo! Score.
- Game. Us.

282
Yes.

283
Come on, Pheebs.

284
Whoo.

285
Well, it looks like, uh,
we kicked your butts.

286
No, no. She kicked our butts.

287
You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.

288
Come on. Two on one.

289
What are you still doing here?
She just broke up with the guy.

290
It's time for you to swoop in.

291
What? Now?

292
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

293
You gotta make sure
that when Paolo walks out...

294
...the first guy Rachel sees is you.

295
She's got to know
that you're everything he's not.

296
You're like... Like the anti-Paolo.

297
My Catholic friend is right.

298
She's distraught. You're there for her.

299
You pick up the pieces,
and then you usher in:

300
The Age of Ross.

301
[PAOLO SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

302
RACHEL:
See this? See?

303
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

304
- How's it going?
MONICA: Don't stare.

305
She just finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

306
Now there's just a lot of gesturing
and arm-waving.

307
Okay, that is either, "How could you?"
Or "Enormous breasts."

308
Here he comes.

309
Uh, I am, uh...

310
...to say goodbye.

311
Oh, okay, bye-bye.

312
Paolo.

313
I really hate you for what you did to Rachel.
But I still have five of these...

314
...so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

315
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

316
Paolo, I just wanna tell you...

317
...and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say...

318
PHOEBE:
Oh. Just look at her.

319
Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us
should go out there...

320
...so she's not overwhelmed.
- Oh, right.

321
And I really think it should be me.

322
BOTH:
Hey.

323
You all right?

324
Oh. I've been better.

325
[SIGHS]

326
Come here.

327
Listen...

328
...you deserve so much better than him.

329
You know? I mean, you...

330
You should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

331
Ross...

332
What?

333
I'm so sick of guys.

334
I don't want to look at another guy.

335
I don't want to think about another guy.

336
I don't even want to be near another guy.

337
[RACHEL SIGHS]

338
Huh.

339
- Ross, you're so great.
- Oh, ha, ha.

340
MONICA: Are you all right?
PHOEBE: Are you okay?

341
Medium. Heh.

342
- Any cookies left?
- Yeah.

343
Heh. See, Rach, um...

344
See, I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer. I really don't.

345
I think what you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

346
No. No. I just need
to be by myself for a while.

347
You know?
I just gotta figure out what I want.

348
No, no.

349
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

350
No, I know. I know.

351
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

352
- What?
- What?

353
[STAMMERING]
I'm having a boy?

354
Uh, no.

355
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

356
I'm having a boy.

357
[STAMMERING]
Am I having a boy?

358
- You're having a boy.
- Aah!

359
- I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.
- Yes!

360
- What?
- What is it?

361
I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.

362
Hey.

363
[IN UNISON]
We already knew that.

364
I'm having a son.

365
Um...

366
Yes. And that would be a shutdown.

367
[IN UNISON]
Shutout!

368
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game.

369
- Oh. It's 2:30 in the morning.
- Yeah. Get out.

370
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

371
Come on, I'll only use my left hand,
huh?

372
Come on, wussies.

373
- All right. Okay. I gotta go.
- Mm-hm.

374
I'm going.

375
And I'm gone.

376
- One more game?
- Oh, yeah.

﻿1
[BOTH YELL]

2
CHANDLER: I'm sorry.
RACHEL: Oh, my God. That's it.

3
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

4
You have no respect
for anybody's privacy.

5
- Rachel, wait.
- No, you wait.

6
- Can I just say one thing?
- What? What?

7
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your...

8
...nippular area.
- Ugh!

9
Honey, honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

10
...who thinks things are
other things.

11
You know?

12
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower...

13
That's pretty much it.

14
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

15
Thanks. Okay.

16
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

17
Okay. I'll miss you.

18
Isn't he great?

19
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

20
I know. I know.

21
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

22
And for a shrink,
he's not too "shrinky." You know?

23
So you think you'll do it on his couch?

24
Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.

25
It's vinyl.

26
- Okay. You guys want anything else?
- Oh, yes.

27
- Could I have...?
- Sorry, we're all out.

28
- Anybody else?
- Okay.

29
Did I, uh, miss something?

30
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

31
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

32
It was an accident.

33
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

34
[ROGER LAUGHS]

35
Can we change the subject, please?

36
Because, hello? These aren't her
"boobies." These are her breasts.

37
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

38
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

39
"Nice"?

40
They were "nice"?

41
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

42
Okay. Rock, hard place...

43
...me.

44
[ROGER LAUGHING]

45
You're so funny.

46
He's really funny.

47
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

48
Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.

49
What did you mean by that?

50
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

51
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

52
Huh.

53
I mean, hey, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

54
Only child, right?

55
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

56
Uh-huh. How did you know?

57
It's textbook.

58
Hey, you guys.

59
You all know my dad, right?

60
- How long are you in the city?
- A couple of days.

61
I got a job midtown.

62
I figure I'm better off
staying with the kid...

63
...than hauling my ass back and forth
on the ferry.

64
I don't know this one.

65
- Oh. This is my friend Roger.
- Hi.

66
- Good to meet you.
ROGER: You too.

67
What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?

68
- Dad, uh...
- Oh, oh.

69
Excuse me.

70
So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?

71
[ROSS GROANS]

72
Oh for two, huh? Heh.

73
Uh, Chandler, quick,
say something funny.

74
Gotta go. Ha, ha.
I miss you too.

75
I love you,
but it's getting late now...

76
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.

77
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and...

78
Excuse me?

79
Did you know this isn't Ma?

80
Her name's Ronni.

81
She's a pet mortician.

82
Sure.

83
So how long have you been...

84
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the Navy yard...

85
...and show you the big ships?

86
- Since then?
- No, it's only been six years.

87
I wanted to give you
a nice memory...

88
...so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

89
Joe, have you ever been in love?

90
I don't know.

91
Then you haven't.

92
- You're burning your tomatoes.
- Hmm. You're one to talk.

93
Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.

94
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

95
Oh, man. Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

96
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

97
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out...

98
...your dad was
leading this double life.

99
He's, like, actually some spy
working for the CIA.

100
That'd be cool.

101
This blows.

102
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

103
Why do they
have to become people?

104
Why do they have...?

105
Why...

106
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

107
What?

108
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

109
All right, we're all adults here.

110
There's only one way
to resolve this.

111
Since you saw her boobies...

112
...I think, uh, you're gonna have to
show her your pee-pee.

113
You know,
I don't see that happening.

114
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

115
Well I'm not showing you my tat.

116
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

117
Hello?

118
PHOEBE: It's Phoebe.
ROGER: And Rog.

119
Come on up.

120
Oh, good. Rog is here.

121
- What's the matter with Rog?
- Nothing. It's a little thing.

122
I hate that guy.

123
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

124
Come on, he's not that bad.

125
That's where you're wrong.
Why would I marry her...

126
...if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

127
I don't know.

128
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

129
- Ha, ha.
- Why? Why would I? Why?

130
Why? Why? Why?

131
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

132
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe...

133
Wait.
Go back to that "sibling" thing.

134
Well, I don't know.

135
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage...

136
...so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

137
[CHUCKLES]

138
That's ridiculous.
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

139
- Oh, so you think I'm a failure?
- Isn't he good?

140
Yeah. No.
That's not what I was saying.

141
All these years,
I thought you were on my side...

142
...but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad...

143
...so they'd favor you.

144
Hey, I married a lesbian
to make you look good.

145
You're right.

146
I mean, you're right.

147
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace...

148
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

149
...which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

150
That's tough, tough stuff.

151
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

152
Okay. Feel better, okay?

153
ROGER: We're gonna be late, sweetie.
- Okay.

154
- Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
- No problem.

155
It was great seeing you again.

156
[ROSS MUTTERS]

157
Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?

158
Remember, they're just food...

159
...they're not love.

160
I hate that guy.

161
JOEY:
Good night, you guys.

162
Oh, look.
It's the woman we ordered.

163
Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you?

164
Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.

165
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

166
Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

167
Oh, my God.

168
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

169
I'm Ronni.

170
Cheese Nip?

171
Uh, Joey's having an embolism...

172
...but I'd go for a Nip.

173
You see, most people,
when their pets pass on...

174
...they want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

175
But occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

176
Like, uh, chasing their tail.

177
Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.

178
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

179
[RONNI LAUGHS]

180
- That's a good one.
- Hey, Joe.

181
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

182
- Huh?
- Hi.

183
- Hey.
RONNl: Hey.

184
Hello, babe.

185
What are...? What are you doing here?

186
Oh, uh, you left your hair
at my apartment.

187
I figured you'd need it
for your meeting.

188
Thank you. Uh...

189
So who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

190
Look, I, uh...

191
I shouldn't have come.

192
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

193
No, I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

194
- Where am I gonna stay? Here?
- Whoa.

195
We'll go to a hotel.

196
- No, you won't.
- No, we won't.

197
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

198
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

199
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

200
That's right, mister.

201
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here...

202
...you're gonna live by my rules.

203
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

204
Wow, he's strict.

205
Dad, you'll be in my room.

206
Ronni, uh, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

207
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

208
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

209
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."

210
Okay. This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

211
- Six years is long enough.
- What kind of change?

212
- Break up with Ronni...
- I can't.

213
Then come clean with Ma.
This is not right.

214
I don't wanna hear it.
Now go to my room.

215
Hey, kickie.

216
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get comfortable.

217
- I can't sleep in my underwear.
- Well, you're gonna.

218
I've been thinking...

219
...about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls.

220
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

221
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

222
I always figured, when
the right one comes along...

223
...I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance, you know?

224
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...

225
You're not him, you're you.

226
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

227
- No.
- No.

228
You decided to go into
the out-of-work-actor business.

229
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

230
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along...

231
...you'll have the guts to say:

232
"No thanks, I'm married."

233
You really think so?

234
Yeah. I really do.

235
- Thanks, Chandler.
- Get off.

236
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

237
- Hi.
- Hi.

238
May I help you?

239
Uh, Joey said I could use your shower
since, uh, Chandler's in ours.

240
Okay. Who are you?

241
- Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
- Uh-huh.

242
The mistress?

243
- Um, come on in.
- Thanks.

244
Hi, I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

245
Hey, Ronni.

246
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

247
Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.

248
Perfect.

249
Fasten your seat belts...

250
...it's pee-pee time.

251
Hey, Mr. Trib.

252
Hey. Good morning, dear.

253
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

254
[RACHEL SHRIEKS]

255
- What's the matter with you?
- I thought it was Chandler.

256
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing.

257
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

258
PHOEBE: Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

259
MONICA: How's it going?
- Good. Oh, oh.

260
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

261
[CHANDLER CHUCKLES]

262
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing.

263
It's just that, uh...

264
It's Roger.

265
Um, ahem, I don't know.
There's something about... Ahem.

266
Basically, we just feel
that he's, uh...

267
We hate that guy.

268
MONICA:
We hate him.

269
We're sorry, Pheebs.

270
Uh-huh. Okay.

271
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive...

272
...that it freaked you out?

273
- No, I hate him.
- No, we hate him.

274
I'm sorry.

275
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

276
Ma. What are you doing here?

277
I came to give you this...

278
...and this.
- Ow.

279
Big ring.

280
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage...

281
...about making things right?

282
Things were fine the way they were.

283
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

284
For God's sake, Joey.
Really.

285
Hold on. You knew?

286
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

287
Your father is no James Bond.

288
You should have heard
his cover stories.

289
"I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's."

290
I mean, what is that?
Please.

291
So then, how could you...?

292
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

293
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

294
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

295
Now he's happy.

296
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

297
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but...

298
...what the hell
are you talking about?

299
- I mean, what about you?
- Me? I'm fine.

300
Look, honey...

301
...in an ideal world...

302
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

303
And I'll tell you something else:

304
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

305
...he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

306
He's been more loving.

307
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

308
I'm happy for you?

309
Well, don't be.

310
Because now everything's screwed up.

311
I just want it the way it was.

312
JOEY:
Ma, I'm sorry.

313
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

314
I know you did, cookie.
Oh, I know you did.

315
So tell me...

316
Did you see her?

317
Yeah.

318
You're 10 times prettier
than she is.

319
That's sweet.

320
Could I take her?

321
With this ring, no contest.

322
ROGER: What's wrong, sweetie?
PHOEBE: Nothing.

323
No, no. What's wrong? Come on.

324
Okay.

325
It's nothing. I'm fine.

326
It's just, um...
It's my friends.

327
They have a liking problem with you...

328
...in that, um...

329
...they don't.

330
Oh. They don't?

331
But you know...

332
...they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

333
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

334
They think you're a little...

335
- What?
- Intense and creepy.

336
Oh.

337
But I don't. Me. Phoebe.

338
Well, I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

339
You're not?
See, that's why you're so great.

340
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior...

341
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

342
You know, this kind of codependent...

343
...emotionally stunted...

344
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

345
...which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

346
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me. Define me.

347
Love me. I need love."

348
So you talked to your dad, huh?

349
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

350
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know even though she does.

351
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore...

352
...because he got
a restraining order.

353
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

354
Wow.

355
Things sure have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

356
So, Joey, are you okay?

357
Yeah, I guess.

358
It's just...
You know, they're parents.

359
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

360
Even if you know better...

361
...you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

362
And just think...

363
...in a couple years,
we get to turn into them.

364
Oh, please.

365
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond...

366
...chasing after 20-year-old boys...

367
...or I'll end up like my mom.

368
- Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

369
MONICA:
How's it going?

370
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

371
ALL:
Oh.

372
Yeah, right.

373
ALL:
No, no, really. Aw.

374
- What happened?
- Ugh. I don't know. I mean...

375
He's a good person...

376
...and he can be really sweet.

377
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

378
It's just, I hate that guy.

379
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

380
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

381
Next stop, Rachel Green.

382
[MONICA & JOEY YELL]

383
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

384
Sorry, wrong boobies.

385
Hello, Joey.

386
Hello, dear.

﻿1
I'm telling you, Ross, she wants you.

2
She barely knows me.
We just live in the same building.

3
- Any contact?
- She lent me an egg once.

4
You're in.

5
Oh, right.

6
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

7
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]

8
Come on, Ross. You gotta get back
in the game here.

9
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you...

10
I don't think we need a third.

11
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
over here, still in the shell?

12
An egg?

13
Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg."

14
I think it's winning.

15
- I think it's insane.
- She'll love it.

16
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Here.

17
[STUTTERS]

18
Go with the egg, my friend.

19
JOEY & CHANDLER:
Go, go, go.

20
- Think it'll work?
- It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

21
MONICA: You cannot do this.
RACHEL: What? Do what?

22
Roger wants to take her out.

23
No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

24
Because he was creepy.

25
And mean. And a little frightening.

26
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day.

27
- Hi.
- Hi.

28
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

29
I know I do.

30
- Hi.
- Hi.

31
What are you doing tomorrow night?

32
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

33
- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight...
- No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

34
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

35
But her friend sounds like such a...

36
Pathetic mess. I know, but...

37
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable. I'm thinking:

38
[MIMICS CASH REGISTER]

39
Thanks.

40
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

41
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
- She said yes.
- Ahem.

43
Yes! Way to go, man.

44
[EGG CRACKS]

45
CHANDLER: Still got the egg, huh?
- Yeah.

46
- How do I look?
- Oh, um...

47
...I don't care.

48
There's Lorraine.

49
Now, remember, no trading.

50
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

51
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

52
Well, well.

53
Look what you brought.

54
Very nice.

55
And what did you bring?

56
She's checking her coat.

57
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

58
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

59
Janice?

60
Oh...

61
...my...

62
...God.

63
Hey, it's Janice.

64
Okay, I'm making a break for it.
I'm going out the window.

65
No, don't, please. I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine.

66
- Just calm down.
- Calm down? Calm down?

67
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months.

68
Hey.

69
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous...

70
...and I can't go when I'm nervous.

71
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

72
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

73
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

74
- Which one was he?
- Pete the Weeper?

75
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

76
[MIMICS SOBBING]
"Oh, was it good for you?"

77
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

78
"I win. I win."

79
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once.

80
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

81
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

82
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

83
There's more beer, right?

84
Oh. You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

85
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle...

86
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

87
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

88
Yeah.

89
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

90
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

91
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

92
Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff
they gave us.

93
Or?

94
Or we can chant and dance around naked,
you know, with sticks.

95
- Burning's good.
- Burning's good.

96
RACHEL:
I've got stuff to burn.

97
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]

98
You know...

99
...ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

100
Yeah? Good for you.

101
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

102
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

103
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

104
That's okay.

105
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

106
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty.

107
We can't do that.

108
What? What can't you do?

109
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

110
Uh, we might be leaving now.

111
Tell me it's you and me "we."

112
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

113
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

114
But I definitely want to be
a part of it.

115
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

116
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

117
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

118
I'm out of here.

119
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

120
I hope she throws up on you.

121
Thanks.

122
- So...
- Just us.

123
Ugh, what a crappy night.

124
Although I have enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out...

125
...of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

126
[LAUGHS]

127
Excuse me.

128
How you doing?

129
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

130
Joey's not a friend. He's...

131
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

132
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

133
I will go for that drink.

134
You got it. Good woman.

135
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

136
- Each.
- That's right. Each.

137
Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.

138
I've always wanted to know.

139
Happy Valentine's Day.

140
Oh, I miss you already.

141
Can you believe this happened?

142
No, no.

143
And yet it did.

144
- Goodbye, Janice.
- Kiss me.

145
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

146
- Hey, Janice.
- Hi, Monica.

147
Okay. Well, this was very special.

148
Rach, come see who's out here.

149
What's going on...?
Oh, my God.

150
Janice. Hi.

151
Janice is gonna go away now.

152
I'll be right back.

153
Oh. Joey. Look who it is.

154
Whoa.

155
Oh, good. Joey's home now.

156
This is so much fun.

157
This is like a reunion in the hall.

158
[LAUGHS]

159
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

160
He just happened to call.

161
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
It's me. How did you know?

162
[LAUGHS]

163
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then...

164
...because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing...

165
...that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

166
...he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half.

167
[LAUGHS]

168
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

169
What?

170
Who are they?

171
The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.

172
And the woman touching her is her...

173
...close personal friend.

174
You mean they're lovers?

175
If you want to put a label on it.

176
Wow. Heh.

177
- Anything else I should know?
- Nope. That's it.

178
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

179
I always forget that part.

180
Hello.

181
Okay. So now we need, um,
sage branches and the sacramental wine.

182
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

183
Um, that's okay.

184
RACHEL: Ooh.
- Okay.

185
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

186
Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...

187
...we wouldn't be doing the ritual
in the first place.

188
- Can we start throwing things in?
- Um, yeah, okay.

189
Oh. Okay. Um...

190
Okay. Barry's letters.

191
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

192
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with:

193
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

194
- A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
- Let me see.

195
He's wearing a sweater.

196
- No.
RACHEL & PHOEBE: Ew!

197
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

198
Wait. Isn't it almost pure...?

199
[ALL SCREAM]

200
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

201
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

202
Oh, man. In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

203
Hello, funny valentine.

204
Hi, just Janice.

205
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

206
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

207
Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.

208
If you don't do it, I will.

209
So, um, what do you do for a living?

210
Well, um for the past few years...

211
[PAGER BEEPS]

212
Oh, no. You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

213
SUSAN:
I thought they could.

214
- Working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

215
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

216
KRISTEN: So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science, heh...

217
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

218
[LAUGHS]

219
Now, that is funny.

220
Hey, do you think...?

221
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

222
Because she's alone now.

223
And pregnant. And sad.

224
- I guess.
- Are you sure?

225
Thanks. Carol.

226
Wanna come over and join us?

227
Oh, no. I'm fine.

228
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down. Come on.

229
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

230
Let's try scooching. Come on.

231
ROSS: Come on.
CAROL: Thank you.

232
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

233
- Carol, Kristen.
- How do you do?

234
Um... Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.

235
And, uh, Kristen...

236
Kristen does something...

237
...that, funnily enough...

238
...wasn't even her major.

239
FIREMAN 1:
What do we got there?

240
A piece of silk boxer shorts...

241
...some greeting cards...

242
...what looks like a
half-charred picture of...

243
Wow, that guy's hairier
than the chief.

244
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

245
It's all right. Don't explain.

246
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

247
- You're our third call tonight.
- Really?

248
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

249
I brought you something.

250
Is it loaded?

251
Oh, little candy hearts.

252
"Chan and Jan forever."

253
I had them made special.

254
Okay, Janice.

255
Janice.

256
Hey, Janice.

257
Look, there's no way for me
to tell you this.

258
At least, there's no new way
for me to tell you this.

259
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

260
That's fine.

261
- It is?
- Mm-hm.

262
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

263
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

264
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

265
Don't you know it yet?

266
You love me, Chandler Bing.

267
Oh, no, I don't.

268
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

269
New Year's, who invited who?

270
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

271
- I did, but...
- You seek me out.

272
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

273
Janice. Janice.

274
You want me. You need me.

275
You can't live without me.

276
And you know it.

277
You just don't know you know it.

278
See you.

279
Call me.

280
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

281
You did so. I swear.
I swear to...

282
How long has she been in the bathroom?

283
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

284
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

285
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

286
- That could be it.
- Oh, God.

287
You know, this is still pretty hot.

288
Mushroom.

289
Smile.

290
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

291
- I'm sorry. That's not funny.
- No, it's just...

292
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

293
Well, do I have to?

294
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

295
...and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

296
But there's...

297
That's it.

298
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

299
And I don't have to...

300
- I know.
- You know?

301
Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.

302
- Let's say you and I give it another shot.
- Ross.

303
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

304
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

305
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

306
Because we're great together,
you know?

307
You can't deny it.

308
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

309
- I mean, how perfect is that?
- Ross...

310
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

311
I love you.

312
I love you too.

313
- But...
- No "but." No "but."

314
You know that thing
we put over here with the pin in it?

315
It's time to take the pin out.

316
Yeah.

317
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

318
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

319
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

320
Not her.

321
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

322
RACHEL: Okay.
MONICA: Great.

323
So, um, will you bring the truck?

324
- I'll even let you ring the bell.
- Wohoo!

325
FIREMAN 1: We'll see you later.
FIREMAN 2: Bye. See you later.

326
Thanks. See you.

327
Oh, my God.

328
See, there you go.

329
- The cleansing worked.
MONICA: You're right.

330
They're nice guys.

331
They're firemen guys.

332
FIREMAN 1: You tell them you're married?
FIREMAN 2: No way.

333
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them.

﻿1
Coffee.

2
- Thank you.
- Cappuccino.

3
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

4
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

5
Aw, thank you.

6
- Rach?
- Yeah?

7
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

8
Oh.

9
Oh, heh.

10
That's why.

11
Sorry.

12
TEDLOCK:
Chandler?

13
Miss Tedlock,
you're looking lovely today.

14
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

15
Yes.

16
Well, Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

17
Oh, listen, if this is about those prank
memos, I had nothing to do with them.

18
Really, nothing at all. Really.

19
Nothing.

20
Hey, you guys. You guys.

21
Chandler's coming, and he says
he has this incredible news.

22
So when he gets here,
let's all act like, you know...

23
- Hey.
GROUP: Hey.

24
Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.

25
ROSS: What's going on?
RACHEL: What's up?

26
It's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers...

27
...and Big Al calls me into his office...

28
...and tells me he wants to make me
processing supervisor.

29
- That is great!
- Congratulations.

30
So I quit.

31
BOTH:
Why?

32
Why?
This was supposed to be a temp job.

33
Yeah, Chandler,
you've been there for five years.

34
I know, but if I took it this...

35
...it'd be like admitting
that this is what I actually do.

36
So was it a lot more money?

37
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be one of those guys...

38
...that's in his office until 12:00 at night
worrying about the WENUS.

39
"The WENUS"?

40
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

41
Oh, that WENUS.

42
So, what are you gonna do?

43
I don't know. That's the thing.
I don't know.

44
I'm not gonna figure it out
working there.

45
Oh! I have something you can do.

46
I have this new massage client.
Steve.

47
Anyway, um, he's opening up
a restaurant...

48
...and he's looking for a head chef.

49
Um, hi there.

50
Hi.

51
Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

52
But, um, Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so...

53
Yeah, I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

54
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

55
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, what kind of food is he looking for?

56
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone...

57
...who can, you know,
create the entire menu.

58
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

59
So, what do you think?

60
Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
see myself in a big white hat.

61
Okay.

62
Oh, Monica. Guess what?

63
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

64
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

65
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

66
Well, I have an appointment
to see Dr. Robert Pilman...

67
...career counselor-a-go-go.

68
I added the "a-go-go."

69
Career counselor?

70
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

71
I don't.

72
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

73
You know, you have goals.
You have dreams.

74
I don't have a dream.

75
Ah, the lesser known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

76
Oh, I love my life. I love my life.

77
Brian's Song.

78
The meeting with that guy went great?

79
So great. He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

80
It's this cute little place on 10th Street.

81
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

82
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

83
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him
Monday night. Kind of like an audition.

84
And Phoebe, he really wants you
to be here, which will be great for me.

85
Because you can make yummy noises.

86
- What are you gonna make?
- Yummy noises.

87
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

88
I don't know. I don't know.
It's just gotta be so great.

89
Oh! I know what you can make. I know.

90
Oh, you should make that thing,
you know, with the stuff.

91
You know that thing with the stuff?

92
Okay, I don't know.

93
Hey, guys, anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

94
Uh, how about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

95
Okay. Ahem.

96
Hey, does anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

97
- Who are you going out with?
- Oh, is this the bug lady?

98
[AS BUG LADY]
I love you, Ross.

99
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady.

100
She's curator of insects at the museum.

101
So, what are you guys gonna do?

102
Well, I just thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place...

103
...and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

104
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

105
- So back to your place?
- Uh-huh.

106
You thinking maybe, heh-heh?

107
Ahem, well, I don't know, heh-heh.

108
I'm hoping heh-heh.

109
I'm telling you,
that monkey's a chick magnet.

110
She's gonna one look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

111
- Aah!
ROSS: Celia, don't worry.

112
Celia, he's not gonna hurt you.
Soothing tones, Celia, soothing tones.

113
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Aah!

114
- Here, here. Marcel? Marcel?
- I can't stand this.

115
- He's got his claws on my...
- Yeah, all right.

116
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

117
- Mm. Good.
MONICA: Yeah?

118
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

119
It's creamier.

120
Yeah? Well, is that better?

121
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish, Monica.

122
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down,
you know?

123
God, what happened to you?

124
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

125
...intelligence tests, personality tests,
and what do I learn?

126
"You're ideally suited for a career
in data processing...

127
...for a large multi-national corporation."

128
That's so great, because you
already know how to do that.

129
Can you believe it?

130
Don't I seem like somebody who should
be doing something really cool?

131
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something...

132
Something.

133
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

134
Oh, hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

135
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

136
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

137
Ooh, you know, um,
I had a grape about five hours ago...

138
...so I better split this with you.

139
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

140
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

141
Well, it is amusing.

142
[PHONE RINGS]

143
Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy.

144
Yeah, 8:00.

145
What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?

146
Okay, great.

147
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

148
Ten dollars an hour for what?

149
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

150
Waitressing?

151
Uh-oh.

152
Ha, ha. Of course I thought of you.

153
But...

154
- But...
- But, but?

155
But, you see, it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know...

156
...and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

157
Oh.

158
I see. Yes. And I've sort of been
maintaining my amateur status...

159
...so that I can waitress in the Olympics.

160
You know, I don't mean to brag,
but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

161
Amuse-bouche?

162
Talk to me.

163
Okay, uh, ahem, a weird thing happened
to me on the train this morning...

164
No, no, no. Talk dirty.

165
- Wow. Here?
- Come on.

166
Come on.

167
Say something...

168
...hot.

169
- What?
- Uh...

170
- What?
- Ooh.

171
- What?
- Um...

172
What?

173
- What?
- Vulva.

174
"Vulva"?

175
All right, I panicked, all right?

176
She took me by surprise.

177
You know, but it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.

178
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

179
Shut up. It was nice. I just...

180
I just don't think I'm the dirty-talking
kind of guy, you know?

181
What's the big deal?
Just say what you want to do to her.

182
Or what you want her to do to you.

183
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

184
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

185
Please be kidding.

186
Why not? Come on.

187
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

188
Okay, I'm, uh...

189
I'm in my apartment...

190
Yeah, what else?

191
That's it. You're not there.
We're not having this conversation.

192
- All right. Look, I'll start, okay?
- Joey, please.

193
Come on, come on.
All right, ready? Look.

194
Oh, Ross.

195
You get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

196
See?

197
- All right, now you say something.
- I, uh... I really don't think so.

198
Come on.

199
- You like this woman, right?
- Yeah.

200
- You wanna see her again, right?
- Sure.

201
Well, if you can't talk dirty to me,
how are you gonna talk dirty to her?

202
Now tell me you want to caress my butt.

203
Okay, turn around.

204
I just don't want you staring at me
when I'm doing this.

205
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

206
Okay.

207
Ahem, I want, um...

208
Okay, I want...

209
...to feel...

210
...your hot, soft skin with my lips.

211
There you go.

212
Keep going, keep going.

213
I, uh...

214
I want to take my tongue and...

215
And...

216
Say it.

217
Say it!

218
Run it all over your body...

219
...until you're trembling with...

220
With?

221
- Funny story.
- You're not gonna believe this.

222
It's okay. It's okay.

223
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

224
Hey, while you were sleeping,
that guy from your old job called again.

225
Oh. Again?

226
- And again and again and again.
- And again.

227
[PHONE RINGS]

228
Hello? Heh. And again.

229
Ah.

230
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 15th floor?

231
Yeah, I miss you too.

232
Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know?

233
Well, that's very generous.

234
Uh, but look, this isn't about the money.

235
You know? I need something
that's more than a job.

236
I need something I really care about...

237
And that's on top of the year-end
bonus structure you mentioned earlier?

238
BOTH:
Your dream.

239
Look, Al.
Al, I'm not playing hardball here, okay?

240
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection.

241
No... No, no. No, no.

242
No, stop saying numbers!

243
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!
You got the wrong guy!

244
I'll see you Monday!

245
Ah.

246
Huh?

247
Wow. It's huge.

248
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

249
Oh, this is a cube.

250
Look at this.

251
[GASPS]

252
You have a window!

253
Yes, indeedy.

254
- With a beautiful view of...
- Oh, look. That guy's peeing.

255
Okay. That's enough of the view.
All right, check this out.

256
- Ahem. Okay, sit down here. Sit down.
- Okay.

257
Okay, this is great. This is great.

258
- Ahem. You ready?
- Yeah.

259
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

260
Thank you, Helen, that'll be all.

261
Last time I do that. I promise.

262
Wendy, we had a deal.

263
Yeah, you promised.

264
Wendy. Wendy. Wendy!

265
[GROANS]

266
Hmm, who was that?

267
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.

268
That's too bad.

269
Bye-bye.

270
- Ten dollars an hour.
- Nope.

271
Twelve dollars an hour.

272
Mon, I wish I could,
but I've made plans to walk around.

273
You know, Rachel, when you ran out
on your wedding, I was there for you.

274
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you...

275
Twenty dollars an hour.

276
Done.

277
- Well, hello. Welcome to Monica's.
- Hello.

278
May I take your coat?

279
- Hi, Steve.
- Hello, Monica.

280
Hello, greeter girl.

281
- This is Rachel.
- Yeah, okay.

282
Mm, everything smells so delicious.

283
You know, I can't remember a time
I smelled such a delicious combination of...

284
Okay, smells.

285
Well, it's a lovely apartment.

286
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?

287
I was just being polite, but all right.

288
What? What's up?

289
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

290
What?

291
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

292
Okay, okay, okay.

293
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech. Okay.

294
Is it dry in here?

295
Let me get you some wine.

296
Yeah, I think we're ready
for our first course too.

297
Okay...

298
These are rock shrimp ravioli...

299
...in a cilantro ponzu sauce...
- Oh.

300
...with just a touch of minced...

301
...ginger.

302
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy.

303
These are fantastic.

304
Oh, gosh. I'm so glad you liked them.

305
Like them?
I could eat a hundred of them.

306
Oh. Well, um...

307
That's all there is of these...

308
...but in about eight and a half minutes,
we'll be serving some delicious tartlets.

309
"Tartlets"? Heh.

310
"Tartlets."

311
Word has lost all meaning.

312
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

313
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

314
Oh, cool. Taco shells.

315
You know, these are... They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

316
You know what?
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

317
Hey. Sugar-O's.

318
You know, if you just wait
another six and a half minutes...

319
Oh. Macaroni and cheese.
We gotta make this.

320
No, we don't.

321
Oh, okay.

322
Oh, sorry.

323
Yeah, why don't you
just have a seat here?

324
Okay.

325
Okay. Give me the Gummy Bears.

326
Yeah, I... No.

327
- Give them to me.
- All right, we'll share.

328
- No. Give me the bears.
- Well, then you can't have any.

329
- Give them to me.
- This is not worth it.

330
Oh, oh! Bears overboard.
They're drowning.

331
Hey, fellas. Grab onto a Sugar-O.
Save yourselves.

332
Help! Help! I'm drowning. Help! Help!

333
That's it, okay? Dinner is over.

334
- What?
- "What"?

335
- Why?
MONICA: "Why"?

336
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

337
...and you can't even wait four and a half
minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?

338
[OVEN TIMER DINGS]

339
Hey...

340
What a tool.

341
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

342
I know. It's just... I don't know,
I just thought that this was, you know, "it."

343
Look, you'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

344
Yeah, you know all those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

345
[CLEARS THROAT]

346
So, uh, how did it go with Celia?

347
Oh, uh, I was unbelievable.

348
All right, Ross.

349
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

350
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

351
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines...

352
...themes, a motif.

353
At one point, there were villagers.

354
Oh, and, uh...

355
Well, um, you know, by the time
we finished with all the dirty talk...

356
...it was kind of late
and we were both exhausted, so...

357
- You cuddled.
- Yeah, which was nice.

358
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie or something?

359
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
for Chandler?

360
Whoa. Where the hell is he?

361
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is...

362
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy.

363
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something.

364
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

365
Whoa.

366
- How's this?
- Eek!

367
- Sorry. How about over here?
- Oh!

368
See, now, that just means it's working.

369
- Does this hurt?
- No.

370
- How about this?
- Aah!

371
There you go.

Okay, will that be all?

7
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

8
Yeah, um, I was over there...

9
...then you said, "Excuse me, miss."
So now I'm here.

10
No, no. How come you're working here?

11
Right. Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

12
Can we start over?

13
- Yeah. Okay, great. I'll be over here.
- No, no, no, no.

14
I don't know whether he's testing me
or just acting out...

15
...but my monkey is out of control.

16
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

17
Supposedly by accident.

18
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

19
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did...

20
...and peed all over the crossword.

21
I've never done that.

22
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

23
I'm saying I see a difference.

24
They're twins.

25
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

26
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

27
- Let's not do that anymore.
- Okay.

28
ROSS: Hey, guys.
ALL: Hey.

29
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today.

30
Ooh. Oh, fun. Okay.

31
- Um, Liam Neeson.
- No.

32
- Morley Safer.
JOEY: Nope.

33
- The woman who cuts my hair.
JOEY: No.

34
Look, this could be a really long game.

35
Your sister, Ursula.

36
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

37
She works at that place, uh...

38
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

39
Oh, you do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

40
Hmm? Yeah.

41
So, um, is she fat?

42
Not from where I was standing.

43
Where were you standing?

44
Uh, Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

45
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

46
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

47
Oh. Oh. She was the first to walk...

48
...even though I did it
later that same day.

49
To my parents, by then it was,
"Yeah, what else is new?"

50
ROSS:
Oh.

51
Pheebs, I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

52
Oh, and I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

53
So is this just gonna be you and Carol?

54
No. Susan will be there too.

55
We've got dads. We've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

56
Well, isn't that gonna be weird?

57
No. It might have been at first...

58
...but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

59
- Ross, that's my jacket.
- I know.

60
Hi. We're the Rostens.

61
I'm J.C. And he's Michael.

62
And we're having a boy and a girl.

63
Good for you.
Alrighty, next?

64
Hi. Um, I'm, uh... Ahem.

65
I'm Ross Geller.

66
And, uh, that's my boy in there.

67
And, uh, this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

68
Susan is, um, Carol's...

69
[MUMBLES]

70
Who's next?

71
I'm sorry, Susan is?

72
- Susan is Carol's friend.
- Life partner.

73
Like buddies.

74
Like lovers.

75
You know how close women can get.

76
- Susan and I live together.
- I was married to her.

77
- Carol. Not me.
- It's a little complicated.

78
- But we're fine.
- Absolutely.

79
So, twins. Ha.

80
That's like two births.

81
Ouch.

82
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

83
[MIMICS INTERCOM BUZZING]
- To you too, Helen.

84
HELEN [OVER INTERCOM]:
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

85
Oh. Okay, send her in.

86
Hi.

87
- Hi, Nina. Come on in.
- You wanted to see me?

88
Uh, yes.
Uh, I was just going over your data.

89
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

90
Which is bad, because?

91
- Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
- Ha, ha.

92
Excuse me?

93
WENUS. Ahem.

94
- Weekly Estimated...
- Oh, Net Usage Statistics.

95
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

96
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your...

97
...WENUS.

98
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that...

99
...she's really, really cute.

100
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

101
Ross.

102
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

103
Marcel. Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

104
Marcel.

105
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now.

106
You give Rossy the remote...

107
[CHARACTERS SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

108
- Great.
- Relax. I'll fix it.

109
Oh, cool. Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.

110
How did he do this?

111
So tell me,
is leaving the Christmas lights up...

112
...part of your plan to keep us merry
all year long?

113
No, someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's...

114
...but obviously someone forgot.

115
Well, someone was supposed to write:

116
"Rach, take down the lights,"
and put it on the refrigera...

117
How long has that been there?

118
Hey, where you been?

119
I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula
likes me. All I ordered was coffee.

120
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

121
Score.

122
She is so hot.

123
Listen, okay, before you do
anything Joey-like...

124
...you might want to run it by, uh...

125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

126
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

127
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

128
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

129
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

130
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know...

131
...whatever. And, um...

132
I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

133
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so, um...

134
I don't know. Why not?

135
Cool. Thanks.

136
You okay?

137
Yeah, I'm fine.

138
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

139
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

140
Sorry.

141
- Hi.
- Hi.

142
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, where's Carol?

143
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

144
You can go.
I'll get the information.

145
No, no, ahem, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

146
Oh, good.

147
This will be fun.

148
Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

149
Mommies, get on your back.

150
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

151
- What?
- What?

152
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

153
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

154
I don't see why I have to miss out on the
coaching training because I'm a woman.

155
I see. So, what do you propose to do?

156
- I'll flip you for it.
- Flip me for it? No, no, no.

157
Heads, heads, heads.

158
On your back, Mom.

159
All right, mommies,
take a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

160
Good.

161
Now imagine your vagina is opening...

162
...like a flower.

163
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

164
Mr. Dee. How's it going, sir?

165
Uh, it's been better.

166
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

167
- And?
- It's pretty ugly.

168
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

169
- So, what does this mean?
- We're gonna be laying off people.

170
Listen, I know I came in late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

171
Not you.

172
Relax.

173
Ever have to fire anyone?

174
CHANDLER:
Nina...

175

176
Nina...

177
Are you okay?

178
Yes. Yes, I am.

179
[CLEARS THROAT]

180
Uh, listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was, uh...

181
Please don't hate me.

182
What?

183
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

184
So, Pheebs, what do you want
for your birthday?

185
Well, what I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

186
Okay.

187
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

188
- Bath salts would be nice.
- Oh, okay. Good.

189
What is this place?

190
Look, you're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

191
How bad could it be?

192
I think we have an answer.

193
What's she doing here?

194
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

195
- Think she got fired at Riff's?
- No, we were there last night.

196
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go?

197
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

198
It looks like her.

199
- Um, excuse me?
- Yeah?

200
Hi, it's us.

201
Right. And it's me.

202
So you're here too?

203
As much as you are.

204
Your turn.

205
- We know what we want.
- Oh, that's good.

206
- All we want is two caffe lattes.
- And some biscotti cookies.

207
Good choice.

208
- It's definitely her.
- Yeah.

209
[CHARACTERS SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

210
I can't believe you.

211
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job yet?

212
Well, you still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

213
Congratulations. I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

214
I'm just trying to find the right moment.

215
Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

216
"Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?"

217
- Hey.
- Hey.

218
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

219
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

220
I'll get it.

221
Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles.

222
You're doing it again.

223
We're not doing anything.

224
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

225
I can hear you through the ceiling.

226
My cats can't sleep.

227
You don't even have cats.

228
I could have cats.

229
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

230
We'll try to keep it down.

231
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

232
Try this on to make sure it fits.

233
Oh, my first birthday present.
Oh, this is really...

234
Oh, no, no. It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

235
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

236
Okay, it fits.

237
- Are you seeing her again tonight?
- Yep, Ice Capades.

238
Wow, this is serious.

239
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of capade.

240
I don't know. I like her.

241
She's different.
There's, uh, something about her...

242
That you like.
We get it. You like her. Great.

243
Hey, Phoebe, I asked you,
and you said it was okay.

244
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

245
Okay.

246
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

247
Okay.

248

253
Cool tie.

254
She's still here.

255
Yes. Yes, she is.

256
Didn't I memo you on this?

257
See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen...

258
...Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

259
[CHANDLER CLEARS THROAT]

260
And, uh, he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

261
In fact, he, uh, mentioned
the word "frenzy."

262
You're kidding. She seems so...

263
Oh, no, no. Nina? She's:

264
In fact, if you asked her now...

265
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

266
That's unbelievable.

267
And yet believable.

268
So I decided not to fire her again...

269
...until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

270
I see. Hmm. You never really know
what's going on inside a person's head.

271
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

It's impossible. It's just impossible.

279
What is, honey?

280
What that woman...

281
...did.

282
I am not doing that. Heh.

283
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

284
- It'll just stay in. Ha, ha.
- Carol, honey. Shh.

285
- Everything will be all right.
- What do you know?

286
No one's saying to you,
"Hi, is that your nostril?

287
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?"

288
Carol, sweetie.

289
Cleansing breath.

290
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

291
The birth part is just one day...

292
...and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

293
SUSAN: I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

294
Ross?

295
Ross.

296
I'm gonna be a father.

297
- This is just occurring to you?
- I always knew I was having a baby.

298
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

299
Oh, you're gonna be great.

300
How could you say that?

301
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

302
How will I raise a kid?

303
You know, Ross, some scientists
are now saying...

304
...that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

305
- Where are you going?
- Out.

306
With?

307
Yes.

308
All right, can I just ask you one question?

309
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

310
You know?

311
Yet?

312
Well, not that it's any
of your business...

313
...but no, we haven't, okay?

314
You meant sex, right?

315
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

316
- Do you have a sec?
- Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?

317
I don't know. For the past couple days,
people have been avoiding me...

318
...and giving me
these really strange looks.

319
Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...

320
...they're, uh, jealous of us.

321
Maybe.

322
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

323
Uh, well, maybe that's, uh,
because you're getting a big raise.

324
- I am?
- Sure. Why not?

325
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

326
Oh, you don't know.

327
Helen, make sure we put through the
paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

328
HELEN [OVER INTERCOM]: Still want her
psychological profile sent to personnel?

329
- What?
- Helen drinks.

330
Will you marry me?

331
- Well, I ended up telling her everything.
- Ooh. How'd she take it?

332
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

333
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

334
...never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

335
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

336
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

337
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

338
Because I can't watch.

339
- Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
- Okay.

340
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

341
It's just, you know,
this whole stupid Ursula thing.

342
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?

343
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

344
Um, yeah.

345
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

346
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

347
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson Thermos...

348
...so she threw it under the bus.

349
And then there's Randy Brown...

350
...who was like...

351
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was like your best friend?

352
- No.
- No.

353
Well, but that's what he was for me.

354
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away...

355
...and then broke his heart.

356
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

357
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

358
Oh, Pheebs.

359
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my Thermos...

360
...or anything, but...

361
- You won't lose him.
- You gotta talk to Joey.

362
Yeah, okay.

363
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt...

364
He's falling in love with her.

365
Oh, please.
They've been going out a week.

366
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

367
Okay.

368
Oh. Okay. Oh.

369
Oh.

370
Yeah, um, may we help you?

371
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing.
Would you come inside?

No, no, no, no, no.

65
Right, but...

66
...it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

67
And so I, uh, heh...

68
I just heave it downfield.

69
What are you, crazy?
That's a baby.

70
He should take the sack?

71
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

72
And I realize that I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him, right?

73
Only I know there's no way
I'm not gonna get there in time.

74
So I am running and I'm running...

75
...and that is when I woke up.

76
See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

77
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

78
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

79
You're gonna make a great dad.

80
Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

81
Oh. Have either of you ever been to
the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

82
Only if you order stuff.

83
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

84
- Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
- When's that?

85
ROSS:
Uh...

86
...tonight.

87
Ugh, man, what are the odds
of that happening?

88
You take your time.

89
There it is.

90
So, what are you gonna do?

91
What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

92
And your friend Phoebe?

93
If she's my friend, hopefully
she'll understand. Wouldn't you guys?

94
Man, if you tried that on my birthday...

95
...you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

96
You add a pinch of saffron,
it makes all the difference.

97
Okay, uh...

98
- Monica?
- Yes?

99
Yes, she is.

100
- Hi. This is my friend Rachel.
- Hi.

101
Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

102
And I'm his friend Dr. Rosen.

103
Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

104
Excuse me?

105
God, young, young.
I meant young, heh.

106
Young to be a doctor.

107
- Oh, good, Rach.
- Thank you.

108
Right.

109
[R.E.M.'S "WHAT'S THE FREQUENCY,
KENNETH?" PLAYING ON STEREO]

110
So he said it was just a sprain,
and that was it.

111
Uh, you left out the stupid part.

112
It's not stupid.

113
The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

114
I think it's totally insane.
I mean, they work for the hospital.

115
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

116
- I say we blow off the dates.
- What? Monica, they are cute.

117
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

118
All right, what have
we learned so far?

119
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

120
[MUSIC STOPS]

121
ALL:
Surprise!

122
What the hell are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me.

123
- Was that the cake?
- Yeah.

124
I got a lemon shmush.

125
Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

126
RACHEL:
I hope it's okay.

127
"Happy Birthday, Peehee."

128
Maybe we can make
a B out of one of those roses.

129
Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

130
- Hey, what's going on?
CHANDLER: Oh, we just...

131
ALL:
Surprise!

132
Oh, oh, oh!

133
This is so great.

134
Oh, my God.

135
This was not at all scary.

136
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty.

137
Betty, hi.

138
You found Betty.
Oh, my gosh. This is so great.

139
Everybody I love is in the same room.

140
Where's Joey?

141
Did you see Betty?

142
I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried-tomato business.

143
Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me,
"Here's a tomato that looks like a prune"...

144
...I'd have said,
"Get out of my office."

145
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

146
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just saying...

147
...if someone had come to me
with the idea...

148
Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm talking about
the whole, uh, baby thing.

149
Did you, uh, ever get this sort of...

150
...panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father" kind of a thing?

151
No.

152
Your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.

153
I wasn't around that much.

154
Is that what this is about?

155
No, no, Dad. I was just wondering.

156
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

157
You always wanted to go to colonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

158
Thanks, Dad. Really, heh.

159
You know, I just, I just...

160
I just needed to know, um...

161
...when did you start
to feel like a father?

162
Oh. Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

163
We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep...

164
...and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

165
You were this ugly little red thing.

166
[CHUCKLES]

167
And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist...

168
...and you squeezed it...

169
...so tight.

170
And that's when I knew.

171
So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

172
We can go to Williamsburg.

173
Eat your fish.

MONICA:
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.

177
RACHEL:
Okay, coming.

178
Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

179
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
Uh, here, we brought wine.

181
Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

182
- So how could we resist?
- Oh, that's great.

183
- So, Monica, how's the ankle?
- It's, uh...

184
[RACHEL CLEARS THROAT]

185
Why don't you tell them?

186
After all, it is your ankle.

187
You know, it's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

188
Listen, why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

189
- Okay.
- Okay.

190
- Um...
- Stat.

191
Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we
just tell them who we really are?

192
- I mean, I think it'll be fine.
- It will not. We'll get in trouble.

193
Monica, would you stop being
such a wuss?

194
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

195
- So?
- So they still seem normal.

196
That's because they are.

197
You have to admit, when we go out
with women we meet at the hospital...

198
Would you relax?
Take a look around.

199
There are no pagan altars.

200
No piles of bones in the corners.

201
They're fine. Go like this:

202
I said we are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby.

203
- I am not a baby.
- Be serious.

204
- You get uptight...
- You act like a princess.

205
- You know what? You know what?
- What? What?

206
Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

207
Excuse me. Hello, here we go.

208
This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

209
Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

210
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

211
See, I was supposed to get married...

212
...but, um, I left the guy at the altar.

213
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but, heh...

215
...hey, that's me.

216
- Why don't you try the hummus?
RACHEL: Ahem.

217
So, Monica, what do you do?

218
Uh, I am a, uh, chef
at a restaurant uptown.

219
- Oh, good for you.
- Yeah, it is.

220
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

221
Well, this hummus is great.

222
God bless the chickpea.

223
[LAUGHING]

224
Oh, God.

225
I am so spoiled.

226
That's it.

227
And by the way, have I mentioned
that back in high school...

228
...I was a cow?

229
I used to wet my bed.

230
I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

231
We both do that.

232

Monica and Rachel's apartment.

234
Uh... Uh, yeah, just one second.
Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.

235
Hi, Dad.

236
No, no. It's me.

237
Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now. Um...

238
But there's something, um...

239
There's something
that I've been meaning to tell you.

240
Excuse me.

241
Remember back in freshman year?

242
Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

243
Daddy...

244
Daddy... Daddy, why?
Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?

245
His father tried to put
you out of business.

246
You are dead.

247
Ross, he's got the remote again.

248
Good.

249
Maybe he can switch it back.

250
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

251
Maybe not.

252
Hello?

253
Uh, ueah... Uh...

254
Okay, uh, hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

255
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

256
Oh, God, what do we do?

257
I don't know.
Just find out what they want.

258
Okay. No, you do it.

259
Hello. This is Monica.

260
Yeah?

261
Oh. Okay.

262
Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

263
We forgot to sign
one of the admissions forms.

264
- Okay, you're right, this wasn't worth it.
- Thank you.

265
- Okay, let me just change.
- Yes.

266
- Hey.
- Hey.

267
Trouble?

268
Your sister stood me up
the other night.

269
Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

270
- Did you try calling her?
- I've been trying for two days.

271
When I called the restaurant,
they said she was too busy to talk.

272
I can't believe
she's blowing me off.

273
Hey.

274
Oh.

275
Um, you got a minute?

276
Um, yeah, I'm just working.

277
- So...
- Uh-huh?

278
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.

279
Oh, wow, you remembered.

280
Oh. It's a Judy Jetson Thermos.

281
Right. Like the kind you...

282
Right.

283
Oh, I got something for you too.

284
How'd you know I was coming?

285
Um, yeah, um, "twin" thing.

286
I can't believe you did this.

287
I can't believe you...

288
...did this.

289
So, what's the deal with, um,
you and Joey?

290
Oh, right.

291
He is so great. But that's over.

292
- Does he know?
- Who?

293
Joey. You know, um, ahem,
he's really nutsy about you.

294
He is? Why?

295
- You got me.
- Right.

296
Excuse me...

297
...doesn't this come
with a side salad?

298
So, um, are you gonna call him?

299
- What, you think he likes me?
- No. Joey.

300
Oh. No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

301
Do you want some chicken?

302
No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

303
You have not changed.

304
Yeah, you too.

305
- Hi. Remember us?
- Mm-hm.

306
Um, yeah, you just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

307
Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

308
Because, um, you see...

309
...I put the wrong name again.

310
- Because, um...
- You're that stupid.

311
I am. I'm that stupid.

312
Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

313
You know, your insurance will cover that.

314
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

315
Okay, worst case scenario:

316
- Say you never feel like a father.
- Uh-huh.

317
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

318
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

319
Do you have a point?

320
You know, you'd think I would.

322
What's up with the simian?

323
It's just a fur ball.

324
Okay, whose turn is it?

325
Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney."

326
No, you got zero points for "idney."

327
I had a K. Where's my K?

328
[GASPING]

329
You've got to help me.
My monkey swallowed a K.

330
Get that animal out of here.

331
The animal hospital is way across town.
He's choking. I don't know what to do.

332
- What's going on?
- Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

333
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people.

334
Lady, he is people.
He has a name, okay?

335
He watches Jeopardy...

336
...he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

337
Please, have a heart.

338
- I'll take a look at him.
- Oh, thank you.

339
- Michael.
- Rachel.

340
- What?
- Monica.

341
- Oh.
- Hi.

342
Hey.

343
Urs.

344
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

345
Listen, um...

346
Don't say "listen." I know that
"listen." I've said that "listen."

347
I'm sorry.

348
I don't get it.
What happened?

349
What about everything
you said under the bridge?

350
Yeah, um, ahem...

351
You know, just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

352
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

353
You don't drink.

354
That's right, I don't.

355
But I was drunk on you.

356
- Oh, Urs.
- But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

357
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

358
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

359
No.

360
No, I couldn't do that.

361
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

362
So you know, it's either her or me.

363
Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.

364
You know...

365
...you're gonna be
really, really hard to get over.

366
I know.

367
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what...

368
...but you have never
looked so beautiful.

369
Really?

370
- Pheebs?
- Yeah.

371
He looks so tiny.

372
- We just got the message.
- Is he all right?

373
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.

374
He also found an M and an O.

375
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

376
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

377
So you feel like a dad yet?

378
No. Why?

379
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

380
That is very dad.

381
Oh, look, he's waking up.

51
And then he did.

52
Well, now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

53
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of guy thing?

54
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

55
Like, it's poker, so only guys can play?

56
No. Women are welcome to play.

Oh, okay, so then what is it?

Some kind of, you know, like,
some kind of, you know, like...

All right, what is it?

60
There just don't happen
to be any women in our game.

61
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

Oh, please. That is such a lame excuse.
I mean, it's a typical guy response.

know how to play?

I have the 10 of spades.

82
This is a poker game. You can't serve food
with more than one syllable.

83
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz...

84
Okay, so at this point, the dealer...

85
You know what? We got it. We got it.
Let's play for real. High stakes. Big bucks.

86
All right, now, you sure?
Phoebe just threw away two jacks...

- About how good your cards were.

96
Heh. I was bluffing.

Aha. And what is "bluffing"?

- Yeah.
- Yes, and I get my ya-yas from lkea.

115
You have to put them together yourself,
but they cost a little less.

116
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win, all right?

117
In order for me to win,
other people have to lose.

118
So if you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be a nice guy.

119
Okay, because once those cards
are dealt...

120
Yeah?

121
I'm not a nice guy.

122
All right, boys. Let's eat.

123
Ah, did you get that from
the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria?

124
- You still on that?
- Come on.

125
What was with that whole
Black Bart speech?

126
"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy".

127
You're way off, pal.

128
No, I don't think so.
See, Ross, because I think you love her.

129
Uh, no.

130
See, I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

131
I just... Marcel.

132
Where are you going with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.

133
Marcel... Okay. If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

134
[THE TOKENS' "LION SLEEPS TONIGHT"
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]

135
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?

136
Yeah, I know.
He can get really competitive.

137
[LAUGHS]

138
What?

139
Oh. "Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black."

140
Please.

141
I am not as bad as Ross.

142
Oh, I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

143
That was not an incident.

144
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

145
Oh.

146
- Oh! I got an interview. I got an interview.
- You're kidding. Where? Where?

147
- Saks Fifth Avenue.
- Oh, Rachel.

148
Oh, it's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

149
- Well, what's the job?
- Assistant buyer.

150
Oh! I would be shopping...

151
...for a living.

152
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

153
Okay, look. That's Aunt Iris.

154
This woman has been playing poker
since she was 5.

155
You've gotta listen
to every word she says.

156
- Hi.
- Is Tony Randall dead?

157
- Oh, why?
- I don't think so.

158
Well, he may be now
because I think I hit him with my car.

159
- My God. Really?
- No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.

160
Let me tell you something.

161
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap.

162
- Nice earrings.
- Thank you.

163
Girls, sit down.

164
- Um, Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe, and Rachel...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

166
[THE TOKENS' "LION SLEEPS TONIGHT"
PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]

167
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

168
All right.

169
[MUSIC STOPS]

170
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

171
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

172
- Hi.
- Hey.

173
Guess what, guess what, guess what.

174
Uh, okay. The fifth dentist caved,
and now they're all recommending Trident?

175
No, the interview.

176
She loved me. She absolutely loved me.

177
We talked for, like, two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

178
Oh, I went to camp with her cousin.

179
And, oh, the job is perfect.
I can do this. I can do this well.

180
GROUP:
That's great.

181
God. And she told the funniest story.

182
Okay, great,
you'll tell us and we'll laugh.

183
Let's play poker.

184
All right, listen, we talked about it...

185
...and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

186
Yes, yes. We can play some other game.
Like, I don't know...

187
...Pictionary?

188
Very funny. Very funny.

189
I think we'd like to give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

190
BOTH:
Yes, I think we should.

191
Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?

192
No, no. That's okay. You know what?
I'm gonna give it a go.

193
ROSS: All right.
- All right.

194
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $10.

195
And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones.

196
Thanks for teaching us
"Crossed-eyed Mary."

197
You guys, we gotta play that other way.

198
All right, here's my 7.50, but I think
you should know that this money is cursed.

199
- What?
- Oh, I cursed it.

200
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

201
That's all right, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

202
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

203
So that just leaves the big
Green poker machine, who owes 15.

204
Hmm, oh, it's so typical:

205
"Ooh, I'm a man. Ooh, I have a penis.

206
Ooh, I have to win money
to exert my power over women."

207
You know what? This is not over.

208
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

209
And you will beg and we will laugh.

210
And we will take
every last dime you have.

211
And you will hate yourselves forever.

212
Hmm. Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

213
So you gals wanna hand over
your money now?

214
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of actually playing.

215
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.

216
Okay, are we done with the chitchat?
Are we ready to play serious poker?

217
Hey, you guys, look. The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

218
Right, okay. Serious poker.

219
MONICA:
Excuse me. Where are you going?

220
Uh, to the bathroom.

221
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or do you wanna play poker?

222
I wanna go to the bathroom.

223
- All right, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
- Oh, no, no, no.

224
I'm waiting to hear from that job.

225
And the store closes at 9,
so you can eat then.

226
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

227
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

228
Yes.

229
Or no.

230
ROSS:
All right.

231
Your money's mine, Green.

232
Your fly's open, Geller.

233
You guys, you know what I just realized?

234
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

235
Coincidence?

236
Hey, that's "jo-incidence" with a "C."

237
[CHUCKLES]

238
- Uh, Phoebe. Phoebe...
- Yeah, I'm out.

239
I'm in.

240
Me too.

241
Me too. All right. What do you got?

242
Well, you better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

243
Well, well, well.

244
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes.

245
I got four sixes. I won. I actually won.

246
Oh, my God. You know what?
I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

247
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think, oh, that one was Ross'.

248
[SINGSONG] Well, I have got your money.
And you'll never see it.

249
And your fly's still open.

250
I made you look.

251
PHOEBE: I'm in.
RACHEL: I couldn't be inner.

252
PHOEBE:
Monica? Monica, in or out?

253
I hate this game.

254
Okay, Joey, your bet.

255
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

256
...by a fat guy with sores on his face.

257
Oh, I'm out.

258
- Ross?
- Oh, I'm very in.

259
- Chandler?
- Couldn't be more out.

260
Me too. Rachel?

261
Um, I will see you and I'll raise you.

262
What do you say?
You wanna waste another buck?

263
No, not this time.

264
- So, what did you have?
- I'm not telling.

265
- Come on, show them to me.
- No.

266
- Show them to me. Let me see.
- Get your hands out of there.

267
You know, I've had dates like this.

268
Boy, you really can't stand to lose,
can you?

269
Your whole face is getting red.

270
Little veins popping out of your temple.

271
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

272
First of all, I'm not losing.

273
[PHONE RINGS]

274
- Just deal.
- Hello? Rachel Green.

275
[MIMICKING RACHEL]

276
Excuse me.

277
It's about the job.

278
Barbara, hi. How are you?

279
Uh-huh?

280
No, I understand.

281
Yeah, oh, come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

282
Yeah. Oh, but you know,
if anything else opens up, please...

283
Hello?

284
[SCOFFS]

285
Hmm.

286
Sorry, Rach.

287
Yeah, you know,
there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

288
Yeah. Okay.

289
Where were we? Oh. Okay.

290
Five card draw. Uh, jacks are better.

291
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

292
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.

293
Yes, we do.

294
- All right. Check.
- Check.

295
I'm in for 50 cents.

296
- Call.
- I'm in.

297
I see your 50 cents...

298
...and I raise you...

299
...$5.

300
I thought, uh, it was a 50-cent limit.

301
Well, I just lost a job,
and I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks.

302
Does anybody have a problem with that?

303
- Not at all.
- No, no.

304
[MONICA CLEARS THROAT]

305
Loser?

306
No, I fold.

307
What do you mean, you fold?
Hey, come on, what is this?

308
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

309
I mean, what? Were you just full of it?

310
[CLEARS THROAT]

311
I'm in.

312
- How many you want?
- One.

313
Dealer takes two.

314
- What do you bet?
- I bet $2.

315
Okay.

316
See your 2...

317
...and I raise you...

318
...20.
- Wow.

319
I see your 20...

320
...raise you 25.

321
See your 25...

322
...and, uh, Monica, get my purse.

323
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

324
Okay, then get me your purse.

325
Okay. Here you go. Good luck.

326
Thank you.

327
I saw your 25 and I raise you...

328
...7.

329
- Teen.

[GROANS]

331
Joey, I'm a little shy.

332
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

333
- What do you need? What do you need?
- Fifteen.

334
- All right, here's 10.
- Here, I got 5, I got 5.

335
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

336
[CLEARS THROAT]

337
Okay, I am calling your 17.

- That's a tough hand to beat.
- I thought we had them.

Well, when you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards, you know?

347
But look how happy she is.

for the tea, are you?

Oh, cool. A free sample of coffee.

10
Oh, good, because where else
would we get any? Ha, ha.

11
Oh, right.

12
- Oh, great.
- What is it?

13
Country club newsletter.

14
My mother sends me
the engagement notices for inspiration.

15
Oh, my God.

16
Oh, my God. It's Barry and Mindy.

17
- Barry, who you almost...?
- Barry, who I almost...

18
- Mindy, your maid of...
- My maid of...

19
Let me see. That's Mindy?

20
Wow, she is pretty.

21
Lucky...

22
...to have had a friend like you.

23
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
Good boy. Good bye.
Come here, give me the rice.

25
Thank you. Good boy.

26
Well, I see he's mastered the difference
between "bring me the"...

27
...and "pee in the."

28
"Bring me the" and... Rach?

29
- What?
- Hi.

30
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh.

31
This is so stupid.

32
- I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
- Mm.

33
I should be happy for them.

34
I am. I'm happy for them.

35
- Really?
- No.

36
Oh. Oh, I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

37
Whoa, what, uh, ha, ha...

38
What happened to, uh,
"Forget relationships.

39
I'm done with men"?
The whole, uh, penis embargo?

40
Oh, I don't know.

41
I guess it's not about no guys.

42
- It's about the right guy, you know?
- Hmm.

43
With Barry, it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

44
- Mm.
- You know, with Paolo...

45
...that's all there was, was heat.

46
And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual...

47
Right, right. I got it.

48
I was there.

49
I mean, do you think
you can ever have both?

50
You know?
Someone who's like your best friend...

51
...but then also can make
your toes curl.

52
Yes, yes.

53
Yes. Yes, I do. I really do.

54
Uh, in fact, it's funny.

55
Very often, someone who
you wouldn't think could...

56
...curl your toes...

57
...might just be the one who...

58
Hi.

59
- Gets interrupted. Hi.

60
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

61
- Oh, so wonderful.
- Oh, it was so good.

62
- Suck fest.
- Total chick flick.

63
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies...

64
...with, like, you know, like,
guns and bombs...

65
...and, like, buses going really fast.

66
Hey, I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie...

67
...just so long as there's a little nudity.

68
- There was nudity.
- I meant female nudity.

69
All right, I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

70
MONICA & CHANDLER & PHOEBE:
Hugh. Hugh Grant.

71
All right, I've got to go. Ahem.

72
Come on, Marcel. Come on.

73
Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.

74
They're still just friends, right?

75
And I will see you tomorrow.

76
That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow
at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?

77
Hang on, hang on.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

78
Please, Aunt Monica, please? Ha, ha.

79
Oh, unclench.
You're not even gonna be here.

80
CHANDLER:
I can't believe we're having this discussion.

81
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

82
Don't you think if things were gonna happen
with Rachel, they would've happened?

83
I'm telling you,
she said she's looking for a relationship...

84
...with someone exactly like me.

85
She really said that?

86
Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.

87
But she said she's looking for someone.
And someone is gonna be there tonight.

88
"Tonight" tonight?

89
Well, I think it's perfect.
It's just gonna be the two of us.

90
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

91
I can't remember the last time
I got a girl to take care of my monkey.

92
[JOEY LAUGHING]

93
Anyway, you know, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...

94
...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.

95
Hey, you know what you should do?

96
You should take her back to the 1890s
when that phrase was last used.

97
If you keep this up...

98
...you'll be finished with this sucker
by the end of the week.

99
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

100
Now, she used to be a man.

101
Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven.
We hate her.

102
We're glad she's dying.

103
And then... What? Marcel.

104
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You know you're not supposed to...

105
Whoa, whoa.

106
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

107
Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.

108
Oh, God.

109
Oh.

110
Sorry, Barry.

111
A little engagement gift.

112
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

113
[GUNSHOT ON TV]

114
Who died? Who died?

115
Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over.
Oh!

116
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because...

117
Marcel? Marcel? Marc...?

118
- How could you lose him?
- I don't know, I don't know.

119
We were watching TV,
and then he pooped in Monica's shoe...

120
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

121
I don't know. The left one.

122
Which ones?

123
Oh, those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

124
- Hey.
GROUP: Hey.

125
Whoa, oh.
Why is the air in here so negative?

126
- Rachel lost Marcel.
- Oh, no. How?

127
- He pooped in my shoe.
- Which one?

128
Those cute little black ones
I wear all the time.

129
No, which one? Ha, ha.

130
The right or left?

131
Because the left one is lucky.

132
Come on, you guys.
What am I gonna do?

133
All right, all right, all right.
You're a monkey...

134
...you're loose in the city.

135
Where do you go?

136
Okay, it's his first time out...

137
...so he's probably gonna want
to do some of the touristy things.

138
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

139
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.

140
He's gonna be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me.

141
Start with the building.
You take the first and second floor.

142
Phoebe and I will take third and fourth.

143
Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?

144
Okay, you stay here
and just wait by the phone.

145
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

146
Does anybody want to trade?

147
[SIGHS]

148
What do you want?

149
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

150
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

151
No.

152
Why would you leave your Belgian waffle
in the hall?

153
I wasn't ready for it.

154
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

155
I saw Regis Philbin once.

156
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

157
You owe me a waffle.

158
Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

159
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

160
Okay, thanks.

161
- Hi.
- Hey. How did it go today?

162
- Oh, great. It went great. Really great.
- Yeah.

163
- Hey, is that wine?
- Yeah. Yeah.

164
You, uh, want some?

165
- Oh, I would love some.
- Yeah.

166
But you know what? You know what?
Let's not drink it here.

167
I'm feeling kind of crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

168
Uh, okay. Yeah.

169
We could do that. But before we head off
to the murder capital of the Northeast...

170
...I was, uh, kind of wanted
to run something by you.

171
You know how we were,
you know, talking before...

172
...about relationships and stuff, well...

173
- Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this.
- Okay, quick and painful.

174
Oh, God.

175
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

176
Ross, please don't hate me.

177
Oh, what? What? What?

178
[CHUCKLES]

179
You know Marcel?

180
- Yeah?
- Well, ahem.

181
I kind of, uh... I kind of lost him.

183
I can't believe this.

184
I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.

185
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

186
You know what?
I guess it's partially my fault.

187
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

188
I should have started you off with, like,
a pen or a pencil.

189
Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.

190
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got...

191
[DOOR BUZZER]

192
- Who is it?
LUISA [OVER INTERCOM]: Animal Control.

193
- See, I've even got Animal Control.
- You called Animal Control?

194
Uh-huh.

195
Why? Do you not like them?

196
Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

197
I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

198
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

199
Okay, well, now, see,
you never ever, ever told us that.

200
That's right, because I didn't expect you
we're gonna invite them to the apartment.

201
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

202
Hi. Thanks for coming.

203
Somebody called about a monkey?

204
Oh. Oh, you know what?
That was a complete misunderstanding.

205
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

206
- It turned out it was a hat.
- Cat.

207
Cat. What did I say?

208
Hi. We checked
the third and fourth floor.

209
- No one's seen Marcel.
- Marcel?

210
My uncle Marcel.

211
Oh, is that who the monkey's
named after?

212
Okay.

213
Are you aware that possession
of an illegal exotic is punishable...

214
...by up to two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

215
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.

216
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

217
Pheebs, you remember how we talked about
saying things quietly to yourself first?

218
Yes, but there isn't always time.

219
Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Um, have a seat.

220
First of all, we haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

221
Oh, my God, you are.

222
- And you're Rachel Green.
- Yeah.

223
Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?

224
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

225
Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.

226
Monica. It's Luisa!

227
Luisa. From homeroom.

228
Yes!

229
- You have no idea who I am, do you?
RACHEL: No.

230
Not at all.

231
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

232
Would it have been so hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

233
...or "Nice overalls"?

234
Oh, I'm so sorry.

235
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

236
But you. What a bitch.

237
What?

238
You know what? Be that as it may.

239
You think you could you help us out here
on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?

240
Go, Bobcats.

241
I could. But I won't.

242
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

243
[SINGING]
Da, da, da

244
Sorry.

245
[MARCEL CHATTERING]

246
CHANDLER:
Marcel?

247
JOEY:
Marcel?

248
- Marcel?
- Marcel?

249
Hi, can I help you?

250
Uh, we're kind of having an emergency,
and, ahem, we were looking for something.

251
- A monkey.
- Yes, have you seen any?

252
No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.

253
Do you know anything
about fixing radiators?

254
Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

255
- Of course.
- Oh. Then, no.

256
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum in here?

257
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

258
Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.

259
Um, we may not know
about radiators, per se...

260
...but we do have a certain amount
of expertise...

261
...in the heating and cooling milieu.

262
Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle
of something here?

263
Yes, but these women are very hot
and they need our help.

264
And they're very hot.

265
We can't, all right?

266
We're sorry.

267
You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised we'd find this monkey.

268
If you see him, he's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

269
So if we could get some pictures of you,
you'd really be helping us out.

270
Okay, from now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

271
- Marcel?
- Marcel.

272
PHOEBE & MONICA:
Marcel?

273
Marcel?

274
- Oh, my God.
- What?

275
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

276
- What is it?
- Oh.

277
Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

278
[MARCEL CHATTERING]

279
MONICA:
Look, Phoebe.

280
Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel. Come here.

281
- Oh, come here, Marcel.
- Step aside, ladies.

282
- What are you gonna do?
- Just a small tranquilizer.

283
PHOEBE:
Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!

284
- Damn.
- Are you okay?

285
Oh, yeah, I think so.

286
Oh.

287
Huh.

288
Whoa.

289
Oh, gosh.

290
ROSS & RACHEL:
Marcel. Marcel.

291
This is ridiculous.
We've been all over the neighborhood.

292
He's gone. He's just gone.

293
- Ross, you don't know that.
- Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.

294
He doesn't know the Village.

295
And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my...

296
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

297
Thank you very much.

298
Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

299
What do you want me to do? Huh?
You want me to break my foot too?

300
Here, I'm gonna break my foot right now.
Ow!

301
Oh, my God. There, are you happy now?

302
Yeah, yeah. You know,
now that you kicked the sign...

303
...hey, ha, ha,
I don't miss Marcel anymore.

304
You know, it's not like
I did this on purpose.

305
No, no, no. No, no.
This is just vintage Rachel.

306
I mean, things just sort of happen
around you.

307
I mean, you're off in Rachel Land,
doing your Rachel thing...

308
...totally oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and...

309
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Ross.

310
- Forget it, okay?
- Ross.

311
What? What?

312
Hey, banana man.

313
Oh, this is so intense.

314
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

315
Hi. Did you order some bananas?

316
- What about it?
- Give me my monkey back.

317
I don't have a monkey.

318
- Then what's with all the bananas?
- Potassium.

319
[MARCEL CHATTERING]

320
Marcel? Marcel.

321
Okay, where is he? Where is he?
Marcel? Marcel?

322
[ALL GASPING]

323
Marcel.

324
What have you done to him?

325
That's my monkey. That's Patty.
Patty the monkey.

326
Are you insane?

327
- Come here, Marcel. Come on.
- Come here, Patty.

328
Come here, Marcel.

329
Come here, Patty.

330
Here, monkey. Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

331
Gotcha.

332
- Okay, give me my monkey back.
- That's my monkey.

333
You're gonna have to take this up
with the judge.

334
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

335
You can send it back whenever.

336
- All right, I want my monkey.
- No.

337
- Oh, come on, Luisa.
- Sorry, prom queen.

338
You had to be a bitch in high school,
you couldn't have been fat.

339
All right, look, in high school,
I was the prom queen...

340
...and I was the homecoming queen
and the class president and you...

341
...were also there.

342
Look, if you take this monkey...

343
...I will lose one of the most
important people in my life.

344
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

345
Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

346
Take it.

347
No.

348
All right.

349
Well, then how about I call
your supervisor and I tell her...

350
...that you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart.

351
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,
won't it?

352
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

353
You know, with the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

354
Listen...

355
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
You know, I just...

356
No, Ross, come on. No, no. It was my fault.
I almost lost your...

357
No, no. Yeah, but you were the one
who got him back.

358
You know, you were great.

359
Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.

360
Are you in the mood for, uh...

361
...something grape?

362
- Sure, that would be good.
- All right, uh...

363
Oh.

364
The, uh... The neighbors
must be vacuuming.

365
[CLEARS THROAT]

366
Well, ah, as long as we're here...

367
...and not on the subject, um, ahem...

368
I was thinking about, uh...

369
...how mad we got at each other before.

370
And, um, I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we...

371
- Rachel?
- Barry?

372
I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

373
- I'm still in love with you.
- Oh!

374
We have got to start locking that door.

375
This is me in The Sound of Music.

376
- You see the von Trapp kids?
- No.

377
That's because I'm in front of them.

378
Yeah, I thought that was an alp.

379
Well, high school
was not my favorite time.

380
I don't know. I loved high school,
you know?

381
It was just, like, four years
of parties and dating and sex and...

382
Yeah, well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

383
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

384
Gosh, doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

385
Oh, oh, oh.

386
Oh, my butt cheek is waking up.

﻿1
What you guys don't understand is...

2
...for us, kissing is as important
as any part of it.

3
Yeah, right.

4
You serious?

5
Oh, yeah.

6
Everything you need to know
is in that first kiss.

7
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

8
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

9
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through...

10
...before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
Yeah, and it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

12
It's just that that's not...

13
...why we bought the ticket.

14
See, the problem is, though...

15
...after the concert's over,
no matter how great the show was...

16
...you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

17
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic...

18
...basically just trying to stay awake.

19
Yeah, well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

20
Otherwise, you're gonna find yourself...

21
...sitting at home
listening to that album alone.

22
Are we still talking about sex?

23
ROSS:
No, it's good. It is good.

24
It's just that,
doesn't she seem a little angry?

25
Well, she has issues.

26
Does she?

27
He's out banging other women
over the head with a club...

28
...while she sits at home trying to get
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

29
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

30
Okay, they have issues like:

31
"Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close."
See?

32
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

33
- No, no.
- Yes, it is. Carol, hi.

34
ROSS:
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.

35
How about I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age?

36
- Hi.
- Hi.

37
So...

38
You look great.

39
I hate that.

40
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

41
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...

42
...stands erect...

43
- So, what's new? Still a...
- A lesbian?

44
Well...

45
You never know.

46
How's, um...? How's the family?

47
Marty's still totally paranoid.

48
- Oh, and...
- Carol, why are you here, Carol?

49
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

50
Oh. Looks like she didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

51
I think this is the episode
of Three's Company...

52
...where's there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

53
Then I've already seen this one.

54
Are you through with that? Thanks.

55
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

56
Whose little ball of paper is this?

57
Oh, that would be mine.

58
See, I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

59
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

60
[SCOFFS]

61
She already fluffed that pillow.
Monica, you know, you already fluffed...

62
But it's fine.

63
Look, I'm sorry.

64
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

65
Yes, we know how cruel
a parent can be...

66
...about the flatness of a child's pillow.

67
Monica? Hi. Um...

68
Monica, um, you're scaring me.

69
I mean, you're, like, all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

70
Not in a good way.

71
Yeah, calm down.

72
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

73
That's because, as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

74
You see, he's the prince.

75
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

76
Ew, ew, ew.

77
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

78
Ew.

79
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

80
Oh, God. Oh, God.

81
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- No, don't touch that.

82
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to give it back to him.

83
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl...

84
...that stomped on your heart
in front of your entire family"

85
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to
return the ring, without the ring...

86
...which makes it so much harder.

87
Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?

88
- Oh, yeah.
MONICA: Okay, look.

89
When did you have it on last?

90
Doy. Probably right before she lost it.

91
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.

92
I know I had it this morning.

93
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with...

94
Dinah?

95
Oh, don't be mad.

96
- You didn't.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

97
I gave you one job.

98
Oh, but look how straight
those noodles are.

99
Monica, you know that's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

100
I just can't do it.

101
Boys?

102
We're going in.

103
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

104
Hi.

105
Oh, that is not a happy "hi."

106
Carol's pregnant.

107
Oh, I found it.

108
Well, what...? What?

109
Yeah.

110
Do that for another two hours...

111
...you might be where I am
right about now.

112
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing
in perspective, huh, Mon?

113
Well, now, how do you fit
into this whole thing?

114
Well, Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

115
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

116
Basically, it's totally up to me.

117
She is so great. I miss her.

118
What does she mean by "involved"?

119
I mean, presumably,
the biggest part of your job is done.

120
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this...

121
...sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

122
So, what are you gonna do?

123
I have no idea.

124
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

125
[JOEY CLANGING UTENSILS]

126
Well, this is still ruined, right?

127
Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

128
Mm. What's that curry taste?

129
Curry.

130
Mm.

131
I think they're great. I really do.

132
You remember the Lugwins?

133
The big one had a thing for you,
didn't she?

134
They all had a thing for him.

135
Oh, Mom.

136
I'm sorry.
Why is this girl going to call me?

137
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food...

138
...or I don't know.

139
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant,
so...

140
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

141
Well, they don't have to know that.

142
Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti.

143
Yes.

144
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...

145
...easy.

146
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part...

147
...but were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

148
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

149
What that Rachel did to her life.
We ran into her parents at the club.

150
They were not playing very well.

151
I'm not gonna tell you
what they spent on that wedding...

152
...but $40,000 is a lot of money.

153
Well, at least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

154
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

155
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

156
Don't listen to your mother.

157
You're independent
and you always have been.

158
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby...

159
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

160
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles...

161
Look, there are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

162
With his museum and his papers
getting published.

163
Other people are satisfied
with staying where they are.

164
I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.

165
And I read about these women
trying to have it all, and I thank God...

166
...our little Harmonica
doesn't seem to have that problem.

167
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

168
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

169
Okay, okay.

170
Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys
have been wondering...

171
...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

172
And so, well, here's the deal.

173
Carol's a lesbian.

174
She's living with a woman named Susan.

175
She's pregnant with my child.

176
And she and Susan
are going to raise the baby.

177
And you knew about this?

178
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

179
Well, you know, these people are pros.

180
They know what they're doing.
They take their time.

181
They get the job done.

182
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

183
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

184
Must pee.

185
You know, it's even worse
when you're twins.

186
- You're a twin?
- Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

187
She's like this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

188
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

189
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

190
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

191
Well, no, although I did
have an imaginary friend...

192
...who my parents actually preferred.

193
RACHEL:
Hit the lights, please.

194
How long was I in there?

195
I'm just cleaning up.

196
Oh, do you, uh...?
Do you need any help?

197
Um, okay, sure. Thanks.

198
[SIGHS]

199
Anyway...

200
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

201
- Oh, a little.
- Mm-hm.

202
- A lot.
- Mm-hm.

203
So got any advice?

204
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

205
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word "dumped."

206
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

207
So you should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

208
Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

209
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-GYN.

210
You've got Carol tomorrow.

211
When did it get so complicated?

212
Got me.

213
- Remember when we were in high school?
- Yeah.

214
I mean, didn't you think
you' were gonna meet someone...

215
...fall in love, and that'd be it?

216
[SCOFFS]

217
- Ross?
- Yes, yes.

218
Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.

219
[ROSS CHUCKLES]

220
Me neither.

221
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

222
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway...

223
Hi.

224
- Ross, you remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

225
Ross.

226
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

227
So, uh, we're just waiting for?

228
- Dr. Oberman.
- Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he...?

229
- She.
- Of course, "she."

230
She, uh, familiar
with our special situation?

231
Yes, and she's very supportive.

232
Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.

233
No, I'm...

234
CAROL:
Thanks.

235
Quack, quack...

236
...quack, quack, quack.

237
Ross?

238
That opens my cervix.

239
- Barry?
BARRY: Come on in.

240
Are you sure?

241
BARRY: It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

242
Huh?

243
So how are you doing?

244
I'm...

245
I'm okay.

246
You look great.

247
Yeah, well...

248
RECEPTIONIST [OVER SPEAKER]:
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

249
Be right there. I'll be back in a second.

250
I dumped him.

251
Okay.

252
Oh!

253
- Ross.
- So, um...? So how's this going to work...

254
...ahem, you know, with us?

255
You know, when, like, important
decisions have to be made?

256
Give me a "for instance."

257
Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.

258
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon...

259
- Marlon.
...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

260
As in "Mouse"?

261
As in my grandmother.

262
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

263
How about, um...

264
How about "Julia"?

265
Julia.

266
We agreed on Minnie.

267
It's funny, um, we agreed
we'd spend our lives together.

268
Things change. Roll with the punches.

269
I believe Julia's on the table.

270
Oh. Sorry about that.

271
So, what have you been up to?

272
Oh. Not much.

273
- I got a job.
- Hey, that's great.

274
Why are you so tan?

275
Oh, I, uh...

276
I went to Aruba.

277
Oh, no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

278
No.

279
See, uh, I went with...

280
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

281
No.

282
I went with Mindy.

283
Mindy?

284
My maid of honor, Mindy?

285
Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.

286
[CHUCKLES]

287
Well, I'm...

288
You got plugs.

289
Careful, careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.

290
And you got lenses.

291
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

292
Not for her.

293
Oh.

294
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

295
Okay.

296
About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...

297
...more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

298
And I'm an orthodontist.

299
Wow.

300
You know, you were right.
I mean, I thought we were happy.

301
We weren't happy.

302
But with Mindy...

303
...now I'm happy.

304
- Spit.
- What?

305
Me.

306
Anyway, um...

307
I guess, uh... I guess this belongs to you.

308
And thank you for giving it to me.

309
Well, thank you for giving it back.

310
Hello.

311
Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?

312
Helen Geller?

313
- I don't think so.
- Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.

314
Thank you.

315
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

316
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

317
No, actually, um, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

318
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

319
Because it's my baby too.

320
That's funny. Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

321
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

322
- Uh-huh. See?
- All right, you two, stop it.

323
No, no. She gets a credit.
Hey, I'm in there too.

324
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

325
I think that borders on child abuse.

326
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

327
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You see what he's doing?

328
He knows no one
is gonna say all those names.

329
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

330
My way? You think this is my way?

331
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being...

332
...this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

333
Knock, knock.
How are we today? Any nausea?

334
- A little.
- Just a little.

335
Well, I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.

336
Uh, lie back.

337
You know what? I'm gonna go.

338
Um, I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

339
[BABY'S HEART BEATING
OVER SONOGRAM]

340
Oh, my God.

341
Look at that.

342
I know.

343
Well, isn't that amazing?

344
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

345
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

346
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

347
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

348
Then don't do that, all right?

349
Monica?

350
What do you think?

351
Mm-hm.

352
Are you welling up?

353
- No.
- You are.

354
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

355
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

356
Hi, Mindy.

357
Hi, it's Rachel.

358
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

359
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

360
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

361
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

362
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

363
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

364
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

365
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.

﻿1
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

2
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?

4
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

5
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

6
They're crazy.

7
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You gotta come see this.

8
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

9
[RACHEL GASPS]

10
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

11
Oh, that is so sick.

12
I feel violated.

13
And not in a good way.

14
How can people do that?

15
[ALL GROANING AND SCOFFING]

16
Oh, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

17
I'm telling you, years from now,
school children will study it...

18
...as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

19
It was unbelievable.

20
We could totally be ourselves.
We didn't have to play any games.

21
- So have you called her yet?
- Let her know I like her? Are you insane?

22
Guys. It's gross.

23
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

24
I'm right. Right?

25
- Let her dangle.
- Yeah, definitely.

26
Oh.

27
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me...

28
...to find one of you people.

29
God. Come on. Just do it.

30
Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

31
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

32
- I got her machine.
- Her answering machine?

33
No, interestingly enough,
her leaf blower picked up.

34
So, um, why didn't you say anything?

35
Oh, no, no, no. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

36
...I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

37
MONICA: Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
No, no, don't everybody look at once.

38
- Okay, okay. What's going on?
- Okay, they're just talking.

39
Yeah, well, does he look upset?

40
Does he look like
he was just told to shove anything?

41
No. No, actually, he's smiling.

42
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

43
What? What? What?

44
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

45
Oh.

46
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

47
GROUP:
Oh.

48
- See? Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

49
How'd it go?

50
You know, it was, uh...
It was actually really great.

51
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

52
I had that chicken, you know,
where you poke it and butter squirts out.

53
Not a good day for birds.

54
And then we took a walk to Bendel's.

55
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

56
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

57
...to stop calling, stop sending you flowers
and to generally leave you alone, huh?

58
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

59
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again,
you know? It was...

60
It was comfortable and it was familiar.

61
It was just nice.

62
That's "nice" twice.

63
Rachel, what's going on?

64
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

65
Duh. Where have you been?

66
Yeah, but it was different with him today.

67
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy,
you know?

68
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

69
Yes.

70
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

71
Okay, how about the fact that
he's engaged to another woman...

72
...who just happens to be
your ex-best friend?

73
All right. All right, all right, all right.
I know it's stupid.

74
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I will just put an end to it.

75
Wow.

76
- Wow.
- Ha, ha.

77
Yeah.

78
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

79
No, it wasn't.

80
Oh. It was so nice
having this little sink here.

81
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

82
Give me a call when you get a chance."

83
Bye-bye.

84
Oh, God.

85
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

86
Hey, I've been honing.

87
What was with the dishes?

88
Oh, uh, I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant...

89
...you know,
I might have some kind of life.

90
Like I haven't been sitting around here
honing for the last two hours?

91
He's doing it again.
The guy with the telescope.

92
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.

93
Oh. Go away.
Stop looking in here!

94
Great. Now he's waving back.

95
We gotta do something
about that guy.

96
This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment.

97
It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.

98
What kind of stuff?

99
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

100
...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

101
You cook naked?

102
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

103
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

104
What's the matter?

105
Oh, I just...
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

106
No, it was. It was very, very good.

107
- What about Mindy?
- Oh, way better than Mindy.

108
No, not that.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

109
Oh. If you want,
I'll just break it off with her.

110
No. No, no, no.

111
No, don't do that. Not for me.

112
BERNICE: Dr. Farber,
Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

113
Thanks, Bernice.

114
Let's go away this weekend.

115
Oh, Barry. Come on. This is all way too...

116
No, we can go to Aruba.

117
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

118
...it was, uh... It was really nice.
You would've liked it.

119
I had a bra.

120
Hey, Dr. Farber.

121
All right, Miss Green,
everything looks fine.

122
Yep, I think we're starting to see
some real progress here.

123
- What?
- I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

124
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

125
Uh, but for future reference,
um, that thing in your hand...

126
...can also be used as a phone.

127
[PHONE RINGS]

128
Yes, it's working.

129
Why isn't she calling me back?

130
Maybe she never got your message.

131
You know, you could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

132
...that means she probably
didn't get her messages yet.

133
- You don't think that makes me seem...?
- Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

134
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

135
- How many beeps?
- She answered.

136
You see, this is where you'd use
that "hello" word we talked about.

137
I'm not going to.
She obviously got my message...

138
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

139
God, I miss just being needy.

140
GROUP:
Hey.

141
So how'd he take it?

142
Pretty well, actually.

143
Uh, Rach. How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

144
Oh, do I?

145
We ended up having sex in his chair.

146
You had sex in his chair?

147
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

148
You had what?

149
Sex in his chair.

150
What?

151
What were you thinking?

152
I don't know.
I mean, we still care about each other.

153
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

154
No. No, no.

155
It's nothing like me and Carol.

156
Please. If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

157
...right here, right now,"
what would you say?

158
If it helps I could slide over.

159
It's a totally different situation.

160
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians...

161
I gotta go.

162
- Where are you going?
- I just have to go, all right?

163
Do I need a reason, huh?
I have things to do with my life.

164
I have a jam-packed schedule.

165
And I am late for keeping up with it,
okay?

166
[PHONE RINGING]

167
Hello? Hello?

168
[PHONE CONTINUES RINGING]

169
Hello?

170
Huh. Mindy.

171
Hi. Hey, how are you?

172
Yes, yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

173
Really, oh, God...

174
Okay.

175
Okay, I'm working tomorrow...

176
...but if you want,
you can come by if you'd like.

177
Okay.

178
Great.

179
All right.

180
So I'll see you tomorrow.

181
Okay. Bye.

182
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

183
So how's Mindy?

184
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow.

185
Oh, she sounded really weird.
I gotta call Barry.

186
Hi, it's me. I just... Ha! Mindy.

187
Mindy. Hi.

188
No, I figured that's where you'd be.

189
[MIMICKING PHONE]

190
Hell is filled with people like you.

191
He's back. The peeper's back.

192
- Get down.
- Get down?

193
And boogie.

194
Thanks, but I gotta go to work
and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

195
Relax. She may not even know.

196
Please, I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

197
I mean, what else is it about?

198
She was my best friend, you guys.

199
We went to camp together...

200
...she taught me how to kiss...
- Yeah?

201
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

202
- Ugh, I feel so...
- Naughty.

203
- I'll see you guys later.
- I'll walk out with you.

204
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp...

205
...and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or...?

206
That's fine, yeah.

207
Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

208
- Why don't you just take it with you?
- Hey.

209
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

210
Why don't you just call her?

211
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

212
- Do you?
- No.

213
Danielle, hi.

214
Hi, it's Chandler.

215
I'm fine. Ahem.

216
Uh, listen...

217
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, uh, idiot that I am...

218
...I accidentally shut off my phone.

219
Ahem. Oh, okay. That's fine.
That's great. Okay.

220
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

221
She's on the other line,
gonna call me back.

222
- Don't you have to pee?
- That's why I'm dancing.

223
- Mindy.
- Hey, you.

224
Hey, you.

225
So, what's up?

226
Um, we should really be sitting for this.

227
Hmm.

228
Sure we should.

229
[SIGHS]

230
- So...
- Now, I know things have been weird lately.

231
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer...

232
...who I don't talk to anymore...

233
...because she's bitter
that she lost the weight...

234
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

235
Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

236
Okay.

237
[SIGHS]

238
Will you be my maid of honor?

239
- Of course!
- Oh, that's so great!

240
It is! It is!

241
[BOTH SCREAMING]

242
- Is that all you wanted to ask?
- That's all.

243
[BOTH SHOUTING]

244
[CRYING]

245
What? What?

246
That's not all.

247
- Oh, sure it is.
- Oh, no, it isn't. No.

248
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

249
What would make you think that?

250
Well, ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

251
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

252
Really?

253
Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...

254
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

255
Oh, God.
You see, that's what I was afraid of.

256
- What? What's what you were afraid of?
- Okay, okay.

257
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I...

258
...kind of had a little thing on the side.

259
- What?
- I know, I know.

260
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, "Don't do it.

261
He's gonna do to you what he did
to Rachel." And now I feel so stupid.

262
Ha, ha.

263
Hmm. Oh, Mindy.

264
Oh, you are so stupid.

265
Oh, we are both so stupid.

266
What do you mean?

267
- Smell familiar?
MINDY: Oh, no.

268
RACHEL:
Mm-hm.

269
Oh, I'm so sorry.

270
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

271
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

272
Oh, my.

273
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

274
Ring, damn it, ring.

275
Thanks.

276
You know our phone's not working?

277
What?

278
I tried to call you from the coffee shop.
There was no answer.

279
I turned it off.

280
Mother of God, I turned it off.

281
Just like you told her you did.

282
Just pointing out the irony.

283
So listen, I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

284
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

285
[GRUNTS]

286
Can I use your phone?

287
Yeah, the number
for a Sidney Marks, please.

288
"Heating device."

289
Radiator.

290
Five letters.

291
"Rdtor."

292
Yeah, is Sidney there?

293
Oh, this is?

294
- Sidney's a woman.
- So she's a woman, so what?

295
Yeah, yeah, so what?

296
Look, I live across the street...

297
...and I know all about you
and your telescope.

298
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

299
Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?

300
Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear...

301
...I shouldn't have to feel like...
Thank you.

302
That's not really the point.

303
The point is, that...

304
- Mostly free-weights, but occasionally...
- Joey.

305
Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.

306
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

307
The green dress? Really?

308
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman
that day.

309
Heh. No.

310
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

311
- Hey.
- Hey.

312
- You got a second?
- Sure, sure.

313
Come on...

314
...in.

315
Hello, sweetheart.

316
- What you guys doing here?
- Uh, we are here to break up with you.

317
Both of you?

318
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

319
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

320
I'm an idiot. I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

321
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

322
Uh, which one of us
are you talking to there, Bar?

323
Um...

324
Mindy.

325
Mindy, of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

326
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

327
I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

328
Oh, please.

329
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

330
You did it twice?

331
Well, the first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

332
Oh, right.

333
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look...

334
Just give me another chance, okay?

335
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

336
What do you say?

337
BERNICE [OVER INTERCOM]:
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

338
Jason Castalano's
choking on his retainer.

339
Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.

340
Look, please,
please don't go anywhere, okay?

341
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

342
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

343
See how he was sweating
when he walked out of here?

344
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

345
...and take a couple of punches.
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

346
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

347
What are you talking about?

348
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

349
He is Satan in a smock.

350
Look, I know he's not perfect.

351
[GRUNTS]

352
But the truth is,
at the end of the day...

353
...I still really wanna be...

354
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

355
...D.D.S.

356
Oh, God.

357
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

358
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

359
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

360
You okay?

361
Yeah.

362
Really?

363
Yeah.

364
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

365
...I have wondered
whether I made the right choice.

366
Oh. And now I know.

367
MONICA:
I'm so glad.

368
Big day.

369
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

370
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat...

371
Did you know he's gay?

372
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

373
- Chandler?
- Danielle, hi.

374
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

375
GROUP:
Hi.

376
- What are you doing here?
- I've been calling you...

377
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

378
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

379
So I thought I'd just come down here
and make sure you were okay.

380
Oh, uh, I'm okay.

381
Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

382
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

383
- You know.
- Ha, ha.

384
- You got it.
CHANDLER: Okay.

385
- Bye, everybody.
GROUP: Bye.

386
Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.

387
Second date.

388
I don't know.

389
RACHEL:
You don't know?

390
Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
about her coming all the way here...

391
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

392
[ALL GROANING]

﻿1
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

5
When somebody steals your credit card...

6
...they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
That's me.

9
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

10
He's doing it again!

11
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

12
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

13
Come here, Marcel!

14
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

15
You've got to do something
about the humping.

16
What? It's just a phase.

17
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

18
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

19
RACHEL:
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

20
- What?
RACHEL: Ugh!

21
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

22
Ugh, Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

23
- This woman's living my life.
- What?

24
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

25
Look at this. Look.

26
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

27
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

28
She spent $300 on art supplies.

29
You're not an artist.

30
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

31
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

32
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

33
Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?

34
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

35
Do I go horseback riding
in the park, hmm?

36
Do I take classes at The New School?

37
- No.
- No.

38
This is so unfair.

39
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
How about Joey Paponi?

41
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
I should have a name that's more neutral.

42
Joey Switzerland?

43
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm...

44
...this big.

45
Which I'm not!

46
Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?

47
Stalin.

48
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

49
- Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
- Huh.

50
Joe Stalin.

51
You know, that's pretty good.

52
- You might want to try Joseph.
- Ah!

53
Joseph Stalin!

54
- I think you'd remember that!
- Oh, yes!

55
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

56
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.

57
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
Hi.

59
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

60
Um, I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

61
What are you doing?

62
All right, great.

63
Great. Thanks a lot.

64
I'm going to tap class.

65
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

66
She's got my life.
I want to see who she is.

67
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

68
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

69
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

70
This is madness, I tell you.

71
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

72
Thank you.

73
What do you think?

74
Lots of things.

75
Which one do you think she is?

76
- May I help you?
- Oh, no, thanks.

77
We're just here to observe.

78
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

79
Spare shoes are over there.

80
What does she mean?

81
I think she means, "You dance...

82
...a dance class!"

83
Come on, come on, come on!

84
RACHEL:
Really?

85
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

86
People, last time there were yogurt containers
lying around after class.

87
Let's not have that happen again!

88
She could be you.

89
Let's get started.

90
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

91
Okay, I'm not getting this!

92
I'm totally getting it!

93
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

94
What? You just click when they click.

95
All right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

96
Oh! Oh.

97
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

98
Great, it's gym class all over again.

99
RACHEL & PHOEBE:
Aww.

100
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

101
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

102
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

103
Okay, here I am.

104
So who's the new tense girl?

105
She's your partner.

106
- Hi, I'm Monica.
- Hi.

107
Oh, ha.

108
Monica.

109
Hi, I'm Mon...

110
Nana.

111
- Monana?
- Yeah.

112
It's Dutch.

113
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

114
[SPEAKING IN DUTCH]

115
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

116
And we're dancing!

117
Five, six, seven, eight.

118
Hi.

119
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

121
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

122
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

123
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

124
Hey, he beat you!

125
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

126
What does this mean?

127
I have to give him up.

128
I can't believe it. This sucks!

129
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

130
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

131
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

132
...I can't get off my leg.

133
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

134
No. No.

135
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

136
...to some monkey loving...

137
...he's just gonna get vicious.

138
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

139
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

140
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

141
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

142
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

143
Right?

144
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

145
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

146
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

147
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

148
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

149
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

150
Nope. We took her to lunch.

151
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

152
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

153
She stole! She's a stealer!

154
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

155
I mean, she's this astounding person...

156
...with this amazing spirit!

157
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

158
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

159
Mm-hm.

160
I love that joke.

161
- No way! No way did you do this!
- Monana was very brave.

162
It was so wild.

163
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615...

164
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

165
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts...

166
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

167
Go, Monana!

168
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

169
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

170
Oh, by the way...

171
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

172
Excuse me?

173
There's an open call for Cats.

174
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"...

175
...and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?

176
No, no, no.

177
Remember who
you're dealing with here. Ha.

178
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

179
That's because of
your Amish background.

180
- What?
- Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

181
Right.

182
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

183
I was just like you.

184
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

185
- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
- Uh-huh.

186
I thought that movie was so incredibly...

187
...boring!

188
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid...

189
...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

190
What was that?

191
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

192
I walked out of there, and I thought:

193
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

194
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

195
Wow.

196
Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

197
[LAUGHING]

198
Oh, God.

199
We didn't get into Scranton.

200
That was our safety zoo.

201
They take, like, dogs and cows.

202
See?

203
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

204
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.

205
ROSS:
Marcel. Marcel.

206
Marcel, no.

207
Good boy!

208
See? How can nobody want him?

209
Somebody will.

210
You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?

211
You're kidding!

212
Apparently, he was this Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

213
- You'd think you would've known that!
- You'd think I would've.

214
Phoebe, what do you think
a good stage name for me would be?

215
[CLEARS THROAT]

216
Flame Boy!

217
Where exactly is your zoo?

218
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.

219
It's, uh, more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

220
Let me ask you some questions about...
Is it, uh, Marcel?

221
- Yes.
- Yes. Uh...

222
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

223
No, no. He's very docile.

224
Hmm. Even if he were cornered?

225
Well, I don't know. Why?

226
Um, how is he at handling small objects?

227
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

228
What about a hammer or a small blade?

229
[STAMMERS]
Why would he need a blade?

230
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns...

231
...you got to give
the little guy something.

232
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

233
[PANTING]
He got into San Diego!

234
- What?
- Yeah.

235
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing...

236
- He's in!
- He's in? Ah!

237
Did you hear that, Marcel?

238
San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!

239
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good...

240
...but if you give him to me,
I'll start him against a blind rabbit...

241
...and give you 20 percent of the gate.

242
Yo-ho!

243
Where have you been?

244
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

245
Are you drunk?

246
No!

247
I'm lying.

248
I am so drunk!

249
Oh, God!

250
Ugh. Great. You know what?
You could have called.

251
I've been up here. I've been worried...

252
Monica.

253
Monica?

254
Water rules!

255
Yes. Yes, it does.

256
The restaurant called.
They want to know if you're showing up.

257
Nope!

258
I'm going to the Big Apple Circus today.

259
What are you doing?
You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!

260
No, it is me!

261
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows...

262
...and pay the bills as soon as they come in!

263
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

264
I'm...

265
I'm Monana!

266
[PHONE RINGING]

267
Ahem, hello?

268
Yes, she is. Hold on a second, please.

269
Ahem, Monana, it's for you.

270
The credit card people.

271
Hello?

272
Yes?

273
Oh, my God!

274
Thanks.

275
What?

276
They've arrested Monica.

277
- Hi.
- Hey.

278
How are you?

279
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

280
How did you know I was here?

281
Because...

282
...I'm Monica Geller.

283
It was my credit card you were using.

284
That I was not expecting.

285
I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.

286
Oh.

287
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

288
You have given me so much.

289
If it wasn't for you,
I'd never have gotten...

290
...to sing "Memories"
at the Winter Garden Theater.

291
Actually, you only got to sing "Memo..."

292
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

293
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

294
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

295
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women...

296
...and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

297
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

298
There's nothing to wonder about.

299
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

300
- Not necessarily.
- Yes, necessarily.

301
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

302
Um, I'm not actually Amish.

303
Really? Then why are you like that?

304
You by the door, in or out?

305
In!

306
You in the back, you're getting it wrong!

307
At least I'm doing it!

308
WOMAN [OVER PA]: This is the final
boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego...

309
...boarding at Gate 42A.

310
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.

311
- I wrote you this poem.
- Aw.

312
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

313
- Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
- Aww.

314
Okay, bye, champ.

315
There's gonna be a lot of babes
in San Diego...

316
...but remember, there's also a lot to learn.

317
I don't know what to say, Ross.
Uh, it's a monkey.

318
Just say what you feel, Joey.

319
Marcel, I'm hungry.

320
ROSS:
That was good.

321
- Marcel, this is for you.
- Oh.

322
It's, uh, just, you know,
something to, um...

323
...do on the plane.

324
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment, just me and him.

325
- Sure.
- Of course. Absolutely.

326
ALL:
Oh.

327
Marcel, come here. Come here.

328
Come here.

329
Well, buddy...

330
...this is it.

331
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

332
I'm really gonna miss you.

333
You know? And I'm never gonna
forget about you.

334
You've been more than just a pet to me.

335
You've been more like a...

336
Okay. Marcel, would you...?

337
Marcel, would you leave my leg alone?

338
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds? Marc... Would you...?

339
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

340
O! That I were a glove
upon that hand...

341
...that I might touch thy cheek.

342
WOMAN:
That's fine. Thank you.

343
MAN:
Next.

344
Hi. Uh, I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

345
MAN: Name?
- Holden McGroin.

MONICA: Tell him. Please tell him.
- Tell him.

2
- Shut up.
- Tell me what?

3
MONICA: You won't even look at him.
- Oh, come on, tell me.

4
I could use another reason
why women won't look at me.

5
All right, all right, all right.

6
Last night, I had a dream...

7
...that, um, you and I were, uh...

8
Doing it on this table.

9
- Wow.
- Excellent dream score.

10
Why...? Why would you dream that?

11
More importantly, was I any good?

12
Well, you were pretty damned good.
Ha, ha.

13
Interesting, because in my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
Well, last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

15
[ROSS CHUCKLES]

16
I love it when we share.

17
CHANDLER:
You okay there?

18
I can't believe you two had sex
in her dream.

19
I'm sorry. It was a one-time thing.

20
I was very drunk,
and it was someone else's subconscious.

21
- Hello, Rachel.
- Ugh.

22
Get off.

23
Ooh. Oh, give me.
Can you see me operating a drill press?

24
I don't know. What are you wearing?

25
Pheebs, why would you want
to operate a drill press?

26
Just for some short-term work.

27
You know, till I get back
some of my massage clients.

28
Pirates again?

29
No. Nothing like that.

30
I'm just such a dummy.

31
I taught this
"Massage Yourself at Home" workshop.

32
And they are.

33
Hey, hey, Chan, she could work for you.

34
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

35
What? I could. I could do it. What is it?

36
Well, my secretary's gonna be out.

37
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

38
It's a whole big boob story.

39
I could be a secretary.

40
Well, I don't know
if it's your kind of thing...

41
...because, uh,
it involves a lot of being normal...

42
...ahem, for a large portion of the day.

43
I could do that.

44
[BEEPER BEEPING]

45
- What are you playing with?
- It's my new beeper.

46
Why the hell does a paleontologist
need a beeper for?

47
Is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies?
"Help, come quick! They're still extinct!"

48
[CHANDLER LAUGHS]

49
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

50
All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

51
A cool phone number
and a possible name for the kid.

52
- I'll see you guys later.
- Off to see young Ethan?

53
Thank you.

54
How young is young Ethan? Young?

55
He's our age.

56
When we were?

57
- Okay, he's a senior in college.
- College?

58
JOEY: Ooh.
- Whoa.

59
And this man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

60
No, of course not.

61
It's not even an issue...

62
...because I told him I was 22.

63
- What?
- What?

64
- Oh, I can't pass for 22?
- Well, maybe 25, 26.

65
- I am 26.
- There you go.

66
[PHONE RINGING]

67
Can you hear that?

68
Yeah. Ha, ha.

69
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.

70
Oh. Ha, ha.

71
- Okay. Ooh, I'm on.
- Okay.

72
[IN MELLOW VOICE]
Mr. Bing's office.

73
No, I'm sorry,
he's in a meeting right now.

74
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right...

75
Will he know what this is in reference to?

76
And he has your number?

77
All right, I'll see that he gets the message.
Bye-bye.

78
- What?
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Ross says hi.

79
Ah.

80
This is so fun.
All right, what do we do now?

81
Well, now I actually have to get to work.

82
"Most likely."

83
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

84
- Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
- Okay.

85
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

86
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

87
Yes?

88
PHOEBE [OVER INTERCOM]:
What you doing?

89
Okay, windows are clean,
candles are lit.

90
Ooh, belt's too tight. Gotta change the belt.

91
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

92
- Am I out of control?
- Just a touch.

93
Mon, I don't understand.

94
I mean, you've been dating this guy since,
like, his midterms.

95
I mean,
why all of a sudden are you so?

96
Oh.

97
What?

98
Could tonight be the night?

99
I don't know.

100
Look, he's a great guy,
and I love being with him, but, you know...

101
...things happen when they happen.

102
You don't plan these things.

103
- Oh. So did you shave your legs?
- Yeah.

104
Uh-huh.

105
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

106
It doesn't mean...

107
[BEEPER BEEPING]

108
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, this is it. Oh, my God.
It's baby time. Baby time.

109
All right, relax, relax, just relax, just relax.
Be cool.

110
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.

111
No, Andre is not here. Third time today.

112
Yes, I am sure.

113
Heh. No, sir, I do not perform
those kind of services.

114
Services? Oh, services.

115
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

116
Yeah.

117
That's right.

118
That's right. "JUMBO" with a U, sir.

119
Heh. No, you don't want me.

120
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

121
Yeah. Alrighty, bye-bye.

122
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

123
JOEY: Hey, hey. How was the first day?
- Hey. Oh.

124
Excellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

125
See? It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

126
- Me.
- Ah.

127
- I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
- Why not?

128
Well, because, you know.

129
They don't like you.

130
- What?
- I thought you knew that.

131
Nah-uh.

132
- Who doesn't like me?
- Everyone.

133
Except for, um...

134
No. Everyone.

135
- What are you talking about?
- Don't feel bad.

136
You know, they used to like you a lot.

137
But then you got promoted,
and now you're all, like, Mr. Boss-Man.

138
You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing.
Boss-Man Bing.

139
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

140
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

141
- They do me?
- Yeah.

142
You know, like, um, okay:

143
"Could that report be any later?"

144
[JOEY & ROSS LAUGHING]

145
I don't sound like that.

146
- Oh, oh. Chandler.
- Oh. Yeah, you do.

147
"The hills are alive with the sound...

148
...of music."

149
"My scone!"

150
ROSS, JOEY & PHOEBE:
"My scone!"

151
[ALL LAUGHING]

152
Okay, I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

153
[BOTH LAUGHING]

154
That is so not... That is so not... That...

155
Oh, shut up.

156
Ha, ha. You did not.

157
I am telling you, up until I was 9...

158
...I thought gunpoint was an actual place
where crimes happened.

159
- Ha, ha. How is that possible?
- Think about it. It's always on the news.

160
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

161
"Tourists are being terrorized
at Gunpoint."

162
And I just kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

163
Oh, ah.

164
- I should go.
- Okay.

165
Okay.

166
- Unless...
- What?

167
Uh, unless you wanna stay over.

168
I mean, I'm going to. So...

169
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

170
Yeah, I'd really like that.

171
Uh, before we get into
any staying-over stuff...

172
...there's something you should know.

173
Okay. Is this like
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

174
...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?

175
Well, it's somewhere in between.

176
You see, in a strictly technical sense,
of course, I'm not, uh...

177
Well, I mean, I haven't ever, um...

178
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

179
Are you a virgin?

180
Well, if that's what you kids
are calling it these days...

181
...then yes, I am.

182
I, uh... I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

183
- Really?
- Yeah.

184
You do know
I was talking about you, right?

185
Wow.

186
You keep saying that.

187
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

188
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

189
...it is nothing like that.

190
Oh.

191
[ETHAN MOANING]

192
Listen, listen.

193
Um, you told me something
that was really difficult for you.

194
And, um, well, I figure if you can be honest,
then I can too.

195
- Oh, God, don't tell me I did it wrong.
- No.

196
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

197
- Nothing wrong about that.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

198
Um, okay. Here goes.

199
I'm not 22.

200
I'm 25.

201
And 13 months.

202
Huh.

203
But I figure, you know,
that shouldn't change anything.

204
I mean, what the hell does it matter
how old we are?

205
Listen, um...

206
...as long as we're telling stuff, uh...

207
...I have another one for you.

208
I'm a little younger than I said.

209
You're not a senior?

210
Oh, I'm a senior.

211
In high school.

212
Okay.

213
What we did was wrong.

214
Oh, God. I just had sex with someone
who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

215
I just had sex.

216
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

217
- You never told me how old you were.
- That's different.

218
My lie didn't make one of us a felon
in 48 states.

219
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking. I was busy falling...

220
- Don't say it.
...in love with you.

221
Really?

222
Sorry.

223
Well, fall out of it.

224
You know, you shouldn't even be here.
It's a school night.

225
Oh, God. Oh, God.

226
I'm like those women that you see
with shiny guys named Chad.

227
I'm Joan Collins.

228
Who?

229
Okay, Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

230
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

231
Ahem. It's just easier that way.

232
Oh, come on.
You told me about the last dream.

233
No. Forget it.

234
Well, why not?
Was I doing something particularly saucy?

235
All right, fine. Um...

236
Well, you were not the only one there.

237
Joey was there too.

238
All right.

239
Was there, uh, heh...

240
...anybody else there?

241
- No.
- You sure?

242
Nobody, uh, handing out mints
or anything?

243
No, it was just the three of us.

244
Oh.

245
So tell me, was it like you and Chandler
and then you and me...

246
...or you and me and Chandler?

247
[CHUCKLES]

248
- You know what?
- What?

249
There were times...

250
...when it wasn't even me.

251
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

252
That is so sweet, you guys.

253
ROSS: Hey, Mon.
RACHEL: Mon.

254
Mon, Ethan called again.

255
Mon?

256
ALL:
Mon!

257
- What?
- Ethan called again.

258
Oh.

259
- You're not seeing him anymore?
- No.

260
You know,
sometimes just things don't work out.

261
And this has nothing to do with the fact
that he needs a note to get out of gym?

262
I didn't say any...
I did not say anything, I swear.

263
He stopped by.

264
JOEY:
Next time you talk to him...

265
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

266
[MONICA LAUGHING]

267
Oh, my life is just so amusing. Heh, heh.
Can we drop it now?

268
Sorry. Sorry.

269
It's morphing time.

270
- Stegosaurus!
- Tyrannosaurus!

271
[GUYS YELLING]

272
Ooh. Oh, I gotta go.

273
Whoa. Ooh, head rush. Oh.

274
One more and then I have to go.

275
Cool. Ha, ha.

276
Where you going?

277
Oh, I got a birthday party
with some work people.

278
Work people?

279
- Nobody told me.
- No, I know.

280
That's part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you extravaganza.

281
Know what? I don't get this.
A month ago, these people were my friends.

282
Just because I'm in charge,
doesn't mean I'm a different person.

283
Well, then you should come tonight,
just hang out with them.

284
Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

285
- You think I should?
- I really do, yeah.

286
- Okay. Okay.
PHOEBE: Okay.

287
Oh, but, um, could we not go together?

288
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss, you know?

289
CHANDLER:
I think last night was great.

290
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory"?

291
- Mm-hm.
- Ha, ha.

292
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

293
- What?
- Now you're more like Mr. Caring-Boss.

294
Mr. "I'm-One-of-You"-Boss.

295
Mr. "I-Wanna-Be-Your-Buddy"-
Boss-Man-Bing.

296
Then I don't get it.

297
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

298
You're, like, the guy in the big office,
you know?

299
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

300
- They still say you're a great boss.
- They do?

301
Uh-huh.

302
But they're not your friends anymore.

303
- But I just want to...
- No, but you can't.

304
- But I just want...
- Ah-ah.

305
[BEEPER BEEPING]

306
Aren't you gonna...?

307
Oh, Carol and I have a new system.

308
If she punches in "911,"
it means she's having a baby.

309
- Otherwise, I just ignore it.
- What about Andre?

310
This morning he got a call
from what I think was our cousin Nathan.

311
And frankly,
it was a little more than I needed to know.

312
Hey.

313
That was gonna be my opener.

314
Hey, did you guys check out
those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

315
- I thought that was just a rumor.
RACHEL: True story.

316
All right, look, I gotta tell you something.

317
I'm not 17.

318
I only said that
so you'd think I was cute and vulnerable.

319
I'm actually 30.

320
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

321
Monica, this is ridiculous.
We are great together.

322
We can talk, we make each other laugh.
And the sex. Oh, man.

323
Okay, I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

324
- It was.
- Then what's the problem?

325
Ethan, it's, um...

326
It's icky.

327
Icky?

328
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

329
Look, this isn't easy for me either.

330
I wish things were different.

331
If you were a few years older
or I was a few years younger...

332
...or we lived in biblical times...

333
...I could really...
- No, don't say it.

334
- Love you.

335
- Are your hands still wet?
- They're moist.

336
- Yeah, right? Ahem.
- Let's dry them again.

337
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

338
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hello, Mr. Bing.

339
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

340
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers,
I'm gonna need them on my desk...

341
...by 9:00.

342
SANTOS: Sure.
- No problem.

343
You have to give them something,
you know?

344
Okay, that was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

345
- Petrie.
- Petrie. Right, right, okay.

346
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

347
...this weekend.

Oh, that's nice.

351
[MOANING]

352
Ross.

353
- Ross?
- I'm here.

354
You are?

355
Uh... Ahem.

356
[STAMMERS]
We were just...

357
- Wow.
- What?

358
[BEEPER BEEPING]

359
Heh. Great. Now I'm having a baby.

360
- What?
- Oh!

361
- No. I'm having... I'm having a baby!
- Oh. Oh!

362
- Oh, my God.
- I'm having a...!

363
- The phone, the phone!
- The phone. I don't have the phone. Aah!

364
- Ross?
- I'm hurt.

365
Monica, let's go.
Come on, now, people. Woman in labor.

366
- Hey, Ross, look what I got going here.
- Yeah, save it for the cab, okay?

367
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital.

368
What, so I can't look nice?
There might be doctors there.

369
- Joey, get out of the fridge.
JOEY: All right, all right.

370
- What is that?
- For the ride.

371
- Yeah, like in a cab you...
- Save it.

372
- Okay, hating this.
- Monica, come on, now. Let's go.

373
Baby coming. God.

374
[CRYING]
I can't believe it. I'm gonna be an aunt.

375
- Oh, that's...
- I'm gonna have a nephew.

376
Oh, that's nice. Get out.

377
- Come on.
- Let's go, come on.

378
RACHEL:
Okay. Okay.

379
JOEY:
All right, all right, I'm going, I'm going.

380
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Rossy. Rossy.

[ALL CHATTERING]

﻿1
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Dr. Johnson, you have a call on line 7.

2
She's not here yet.
She's having my baby and she's not here.

3
- Everything's fine. Has her water broken?
- I don't know.

4
But when I spoke to her, she said
she'd already passed the mucus plug.

5
[GROANS]

6
Do we have to know about that?

7
What are you gonna do
when you have a baby?

8
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

9
Yes, Joey's made arrangements
to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.

10
Aah, I don't believe this. I mean,
she could be giving birth in the cab.

11
Oh, Ross, relax.

12
It's only like $2 for the first contraction...

13
...and then 50 cents
each additional contraction.

14
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

15
You have to pick your moments.

16
- Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
- No, she's not even here yet.

17
- Oh.
MONICA: What's with the guitar?

18
I just thought we might be here for a while,
so, you know, things might get musical.

19
[ROSS SHOUTS]

20
ROSS: Hey, where the hell have you been?
- We stopped at the gift shop.

21
I was looking at stuffed animals,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

22
Susan wanted a... You're having a baby.
A baby. You don't stop for Chunkys.

23
- I used to have that bumper sticker.
- Ha, ha.

24
You see what I mean?

25
- "Stopped for a Chunky."
- Let it go, Ross.

26
I got an extra one. You want this?

27
No.

28
Hey, how's my favorite
parenting team doing?

29
Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

30
So I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

31
Wow.

32
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

33
[CAROL CHUCKLES]

34
- How you doing with your contractions?
- Oh, I love them.

35
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.

36
Ha, ha. They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

37
Fifty-nine seconds. Quartz. Ha.

38
Swiss quartz. Ha, ha.

39
- Am I allowed to drink anything?
- Ice chips, just ice chips.

40
- They're at the nurses' station.
- I'll get them.

41
SUSAN: No, I'm getting it. Be right back.
- No, I got it. I'm getting it.

42
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

43
CAROL:
Thanks.

44
And if you need anything else, I...

45
...do not believe we have met. Hi.

46
I'm Rachel Green.

47
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate. Ha, ha.

48
It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau.

49
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

50
[LAUGHS]

51
Oh, that's funny.

52
I want a baby.

53
Hmm. Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

54
Get up. Come on, let's get some coffee.

55
Oh, okay, because we never do that.

56
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

57
Or just fall down. That's good too.

58
LYDIA: Knick fan?
JOEY: Oh, yeah.

59
- Oh, boy, do they suck.
- Hey, listen, lady, I...

60
Whoa.

61
Look. Look at your man Ewing.
Nice shot.

62
You know, he couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

63
Oh, yeah? And who do you like?

64
- Celtics.
- Celtics? Ha!

65
They couldn't hit a boat if... Wait.

66
They suck, all right?

67
Shut up.
You know, it's a rebuilding year. You...

68
- Aah! Aah!
- Oh. Aah.

69
Uh, let me get the father. Hey!

70
We need a father over here!
We need a father!

71
There's no father.

72
Oh. Oh.

73
Oh, sorry.

74
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine. I'm...

75
- Oh!
- Oh, uh...

76
Okay. All right. Uh, right this way.

77
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

78
Okay.

79
[PLAYING FOLK MUSIC]

80
[SINGING] They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

81
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

82
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

83
And you cry and you cry and you cry

84
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.

85
Okay.

86
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.

87
No fair. I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

88
- You'll get one.
- Oh, yeah? When?

89
CHANDLER:
I'll tell you what.

90
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

91
...what do you say you and I have one?

92
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

93
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

94
Okay, hypothetically,
why won't I be married when I'm 40?

95
- No, no, no.
- No, no, what is it? Seriously.

96
Is there something
fundamentally unmarriable about me?

97
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

98
Dear God. This parachute is a knapsack.

99
- Hey.
- Hey. Ooh.

100
- Look at you, dressy-dress.
- Yeah.

101
Did you go home and change?

102
Yeah, well, it's an important day.
I wanna look nice.

103
Um, has Dr. Franzblau been by?

104
No, I haven't seen him.

105
Well, where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

106
What if the baby needs him?

107
Rachel, what is the deal
with you and doctors?

108
- Is, like, your father a doctor?
- Yeah. Why?

109
No reason.

110
Mom, we've been through this.

111
No, I am not calling him.

112
I don't care if it is his kid.
The guy's a jerk.

113
No, I am not alone. Joey's here.

114
What do you mean, "Joey who?"

115
[MOUTHS]
Joey who?

116
- Tribbiani.
- Joey Tribbiani.

117
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

118
- She wants to talk to you.
- No.

119
Take the phone.

120
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

121
[JOEY CHUCKLES]

122
Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. Yeah.

123
Yeah, I'm single.

124
Twenty-five.

125
An actor.

126
Hello?

127
- She's not much of a phone person.
- Yeah.

128
So, uh, what's the deal
with this father guy?

129
I mean, if someone was having my baby
somewhere, I'd wanna know about it.

130
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? Um, no.

131
Okay. Uh, look, maybe I should just go.

132
- Maybe you should.
- Good luck.

133
And, uh, take care, huh?

134
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
They let the players run the team.

135
Oh, that is so not true.

136
- Oh, it is. It is.
- It isn't. Isn't.

137
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

138
You're gonna kill me!

139
- Fifteen more seconds. Fourteen, 13, 12...
- Count faster.

140
It's gonna be okay. We're doing it for Jordy.
Keep focusing on Jordy.

141
Who the hell is Jordy?

142
- Your son.
- Whoa, whoa whoa.

143
I don't have a son named Jordy.

144
We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.

145
Well, Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

146
...so we went back to Jordy.

147
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

148
What do you mean, "back to Jordy"?
We never landed on Jordy.

149
We just passed by it
during the whole Jesse/Cody/Dillon fiasco.

150
Ow, ow, ow!

151
- What? What? What?
- Leg cramp, leg cramp.

152
ROSS: I got it. I got it.
- I got it. I'm doing it.

153
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

154
No, you don't.

155
- That is it. I want both of you out.
- What?

156
- She started it.
- He started it.

157
I don't care.

158
I'm trying to get a person
out of my body here...

159
...and you're not making it any easier.
Now go!

160
- Thanks a lot.
- See what you did?

161
- Yeah. Listen...
- Out.

162
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

163
Oh, no.

164
Ew.

165
What is that? Something exploded.

166
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down, will you?

167
Water breaking? What do you mean?
What's that, water breaking?

168
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

169
- Oh, please. This is so your fault.
- How? How is this my fault?

170
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

171
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did
before I came along.

172
- Are you trying to be clever?
- You are so threatened by me.

173
- Everything I say is a problem.
PHOEBE: Hey, hey, hey. Okay. All right.

174
That's it. Get in here. Come on.

175
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

176
There are children coming into the world
in this very building...

177
...and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should be hearing.

178
So just stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

179
Yeah, Susan.

180
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

181
Okay, who wants to hear
something ironic?

182
PHOEBE & SUSAN:
Help!

183
ROSS: Come on!
PHOEBE & SUSAN: Help!

184
ROSS: I'm having a baby in there!
SUSAN: Hello?

185
- Help!
ROSS: Okay, everyone stand back.

186
Ow.

187
Are they here yet?

188
No, honey, but don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

189
And until we do,
we are all here for you, okay?

190
- Okay. Okay.
RACHEL: Okay?

191
Anyway, you were telling me about Paris.
It sounds wonderful.

192
It really was. There was this
great little pastry shop right by my hotel...

193
[CAROL YELLING]

194
There you go, dear. You...

195
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push.

196
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

197
Push him out, push him out. Way out.

198
Let's get that ball and really move.
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

199
Let's get...

200
I was just... Yeah, okay.

201
Push, push, push.

202
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

203
- Help! Help! Help!
- Help!

204
[SINGING] And they found their bodies
The very next day

205
And they found their bodies
The very next...

206
La, la, la, la, la, la

207
ROSS & SUSAN:
Help!

208
No, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great. He's, uh...

209
He's in a whole other place. Yeah.
No, he's gone.

210
No, no, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

211
What do you mean,
this might be your only chance?

212
Oh. Would you stop? I'm only 26.

213
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

214
[BABY COOING]

215
[SOBBING]

216
[CHANDLER MIMICS
STATIC CRACKLING]

217
- Where have you been?
JOEY: Oh, I just had a baby.

218
Mazel tov.

219
I don't know.
It could be an hour, it could be three.

220
But relax, she's doing great.

221
So, uh, tell me,
are you currently involved with anyone?

222
No. No, not at...
At the moment, no, I'm not, no.

223
- Are you?
- No, no.

224
It's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

225
Heh. Right, yeah,
I've heard that about cute doctors.

226
No, no, really.

227
I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

228
...where I do.

229
- Oh.
- Mm.

230
I try not to let work affect my personal life,
but it's hard when you do...

231
...what I do. It's like, uh...

232
Well, for instance, what do you do?

233
- I'm a waitress.
- Okay, all right.

234
Well, aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day...

235
...and you're just like,
"If I see one more cup of coffee..."

236
Ahem. Yeah. Gotcha.

237
- I'm gonna check up on your friend.
- Okay, that's fine.

238
- So how did you know I was even here?
ROY: Your mom called me.

239
So is this her?

240
No, this is a loaner.

241
Listen, I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

242
Oh. I wasn't by myself.
I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

243
So did you see who won the game?

244
Yeah, Knicks by 10. They suck.

245
Eh, they're not so bad.

246
ROSS:
Come on. Come on.

247
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

248
This is supposed to be, like,
the greatest day of my life.

249
My son is being born,
and I should be in there, you know?

250
Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you.

251
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have.

252
Believe me, no one has been waiting
for this as much as I have, okay?

253
And you know what the funny thing is?

254
When this day is over,
you get to go home with the baby.

255
- Where does that leave me?
- You get to be the father.

256
Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

257
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

258
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

259
This is so great.

260
You wanna explain that?

261
I mean, well, because when I was
growing up, you know, my dad left...

262
...and my mother died,
and my stepfather went to jail.

263
So I barely had enough pieces of parents
to make one whole one.

264
And here's this little baby
who has like three whole parents...

265
...who care about it so much that they fight
over who gets to love it the most...

266
...and it's not even born yet.

267
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

268
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

269
Where are they?

270
- I'm sure they'll be here soon.
- They wouldn't miss this.

271
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

272
Okay, you are really frightening me.

273
[CAROL SCREAMS]

274
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

275
Uh... Oh, that's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

276
All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.

277
- All right, honey, time to start pushing.
- But they're not here yet.

278
Sorry, I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

279
Oh, God.

303
I need... Excuse me, can I have this?

304
Oh, sorry.

305
All right, all right.

306
There's too many people in this room.
There's about to be one more.

307
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian life partner, out you go.

308
- Come on, out.
RACHEL: Okay, good luck.

309
- Bye, bye, bye.
- Good luck, you guys, good luck.

310

Carol's lesbian life partner?

311

Out.

312

All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.

315
Oh! A head.

316
Oh. It's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?

317
Not helping.

318
FRANZBLAU:
You're doing great. You're doing fine.

319
- Hello?
- Oh, sorry.

320
What do you see? What do you see?

321
We got a head, we got shoulders,
we got arms, we got...

322
Oh, look at the little... The fingers.

323
Oh, a chest and a stomach...

324
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

325
All right. Okay, legs, knees and feet.

326
Oh, oh.

327
[GASPING]

328
He's here. He's...

329
He's a person.

330
Oh!

331
- Look at that.
- What does he look like?

332
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

333
Really?

334
PHOEBE [FROM ABOVE]:
You guys, he's beautiful.

335
Aw, thanks, Pheebs.

336
No shouting,
but we still need a name for this little guy.

337
How about Ben?

338
I like Ben.

339
Ben.

340
[BEN COOS]

341
- Ha, ha. Ben's good.
- Yeah?

mentioned Ben before?

343
- We, uh, just cooked it up.

- Hey, Ben.

354

355

Thanks. Ha, ha.

356
Oh, God, I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

I know. I still am one of these.

I will always have gum.

But I'll still always come back...

Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.

384
Oh, look, he's opening his eyes.

He doesn't do much, does he?

Nope, this is pretty much it.

Aww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy.

- Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
- Oh, let me see.

Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
That would be nice.

- Pfft.
- Pardon?

Nothing. Just a little extra air
in my mouth. Pfft.

Hey, Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'll pay you back.

I will, really,
I'll pay you back this time.

Where's the money coming from?

I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some, uh, research.

16
What kind of research?

17
Uh, just, you know, science.

18
Science.

19
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

It's a fertility study.

Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

It's not that big a deal.

I just go down there
every other day...

26
...and make my contribution
to the project.

I get $700!

- Oh, Melanie called. She's gonna be late.
- Oh, okay.

So how are things going with you two?

39
Is she becoming your special someone?

40
I don't know. She's, uh...
She's pretty great.

41
Yeah? What does she think of
your little science project?

42
You think I'm gonna tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

Well, the tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex with me.

and according to the rules...

this barbecue was gonna last?

I'm going to China.

You're going to China?

It's, uh, for the museum.

55
We want the bone,
they don't want us to have it.

So I'm going to try to persuade them...
It's a whole big "bone" thing.

Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
for, like, a week.

58
So, uh, if you wanna reach me,
you can't. So here's my itinerary.

59
Um...

60
- Here's a picture of me.
- Oh, let me see.

Could you take it to Carol's now and then
and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me?

I'm your father.

Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I left.

67
- Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
- Oh. Heh.

68
Hey, who's Carl?

69
- The guy she met at the coffeehouse?
- No.

70
- See, there's this guy she met at...
- The coffeehouse? Right.

71
So you do know who he is. Heh.

72
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

73
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

74
- Hi.
- Hey.

75
Hey.

76
- I have to go to China.
- The country?

77
No, this big pile of dishes
in my Mom's breakfront.

78
Do you guys know who Carl is?

79
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...

80
No.

81
- Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.
- Oh, no!

82
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

83
Forget about her.

84
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

85
Of course, there they just call it food.

86
Yeah? I guess. I don't know.

87
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

88
Listen, we're just looking out for you.

89
- I know.
- We want you to be happy.

90
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

91
I'm still on my first.

92
I just think you're nice.

93
Anyway, that's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

94
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha.

95
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

96
Oh!

97
Okay.

98
- How do you like your burgers?
- No. Presents first, food later!

99
Hold on there, tiger.

100
How's it going?
How you holding up?

101
Well, not so good.

102
She thinks tonight's the night
we're gonna complete the transaction...

103
...if you know what I...

104
And you do. Heh.

105
So, uh, have you ever thought about
being there for her?

106
What do you mean?

107
You know, just be there for her.

108
Not following you.

109
Think about it.

110
Okay, I'm guessing this is from...

111
Well, thank you, Melanie.

112
- Okay, this one right here is from me.
- Okay.

113
Hmm. Ah, it's light.

114
[RATTLING]

115
It rattles. It's...

116
...Travel Scrabble.
- Ha, ha, hey!

117
Wow. Thank you.

118
This one's from Joey.

119
It feels like a book. I think it's a book.
Feels like a book. And it's a book!

120
It's Dr. Seuss!

121
That book got me through
some tough times.

122
There is a little child
inside this man.

123
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

124
- Who's this from?
- That's, uh, Ross'.

125
Ah.

126
[CLEARS THROAT]

127
Oh, my God.

128
He remembered.

129
Remembered what?

130
It was, like, months ago.

131
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin in the window.

132
I told him it was just like one
my grandmother had when I was little.

133
Aw! I can't believe he remembered!

134
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

135
Oh, it's so pretty.

136
- This must've cost him a fortune.
- I can't believe he did this.

137
Ross? Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

138
...and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

139
What did you just say?

140
[CLEARS THROAT]

141
[SHUDDERS]

142
Crystal duck.

143
No, no, no.

144
The, um... The "love" part?

145
[BABBLES]

146
Oh, my God.

147
Oh, no, no, no, no.

148
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

149
That'll turn back time.

150
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable.

151
I know. This is really, really huge.

152
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

153
Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

154
Is there a mute button on this woman?

155
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

156
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none.

157
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

158
...but nothing ever happened,
so I just...

159
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

160
Given that he's desperately
in love with you...

161
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

162
Ross?

163
All this time?

164
- I've gotta talk to him.
- He's in China!

165
The country.

166
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

167
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?

168
Yes!

169
- You're never gonna make it!
- I've got to try.

170
What are you gonna say to him?

171
I don't know.

172
CHANDLER:
Maybe you shouldn't go.

173
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

174
Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.

175
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

176
Here, look. All right, does this help?

177
No.

178
All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

179
I've just got to talk to him. I've got...

180
- I'll see you later.
- I love you!

181
Deal with me first!

182
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

183
All right.

184
[SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

185
Ross! Ross.

186
Excuse me, pardon me.

187
- Hi. Your boarding pass?
- Hi.

188
No, I need to talk to my friend.

189
Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway
unless you have a boarding pass.

190
He just went on. He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just...?

191
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

192
All right, um, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

193
Please? This is very important.

194
All right. What's the message?

195
Uh... I don't know.

196
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

197
Excuse me! Sir!
Excuse me! Sir?

198
- I have a message for you.
- What?

199
It's from Rachel. She loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

200
What?

201
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

202
There's no Rachel!

203
Don't give me that deep freeze!

204
[MELANIE MOANS]

205
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

206
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

207
It was nothing.

208
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

209
[LAUGHING]

210
Ahh, you know what?

211
Forget about me. Let's, uh...
Let's give you another turn.

212
Me, again?

213
Sure. Why not?

214
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

215
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you would be.

216
How do you mean?

217
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"

218
- Ha, ha.
- But you...

219
...you're a giver.

220
You're, like, the most generous
man I ever met.

221
I mean, you're practically a woman.

222
So, uh, Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

223
It's only a little torn.

224
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

225
I don't know.

226
Thought about it
all of the way there...

227
...and I thought about it
all the way back and, uh...

228
You know, it's Ross!

229
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

230
- Sure!
- Sure.

231
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

232
...but I'm thinking...

233
...it'd be really great.

234
Oh, my God, me too!
Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!

235
The best part is you already
know everything about him.

236
It's like starting on the 15th date.

237
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

238
Another good point.

239
No, I mean...

240
At the 15th date, you're already
in a "relationship-y" place.

241
You're committed.

242
Huh.

243
What happens if it doesn't work out?

244
- Why isn't it working out?
- I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.

245
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

246
- No, I'm just...
- Maybe there's someone else.

247
Is there? Is there someone else?

248
- No, there is no one else.
- Then why the hell...

249
...are you dumping my brother?
- Wha...?

250
- Hey, big...
- Shh!

251
[WHISPERS]
Spender.

252
She's still asleep.

253
- So how'd it go?
- It was amazing.

254
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

255
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

256
Well, it's like,
last night I couldn't do the thing...

257
...that usually makes me great.

258
So I had to do all this other stuff.

259
And the response I got! Man, oh, man.

260
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

261
Yes I know. As it happens, my room
is very close to the parade route.

262
It was amazing, and not just for her.
Uh-uh. For me too.

263
It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...

264
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

265
You know? It's like,
I was able to appreciate it...

266
...on another level.

267
I didn't know you had another level.

268
I know. Neither did I!

269
- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?
- Yeah.

270
- From who?
- From you.

271
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

272
Well, it's the thought.

273
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

274
At gate 27B?

275
Uh, yeah.

276
Monica, you know,
I've been thinking about it.

277
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

278
- Why?
- Because I feel...

279
...like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

280
I would be going out with all of you.

281
- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and...
- No pressure, no pressure!

282
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so...

283
I'm not "so."

284
I was a teensy bit weird at first...

285
...but I'll be good. I promise.

286
[DOOR BUZZING]

287
Who is it?

288
CARL:
It's me, Carl.

289
Come on up.

290
Behind my brother's back?

291
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

292
- Seven hundred bucks.
- All right, you did it.

293
Do we have any fruit?

294
[CHUCKLES]

295
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?

296
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

297
So you'll stick with this
"it's all for her" thing?

298
What, are you crazy?

299
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

300
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr...

301
...in that stupid electric car...

302
...I'm gonna shoot myself!

303
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

304
...it's just that guy!

305
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

306
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

307
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

308
Can't do it, can you?

309
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

310
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

311
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

312
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

313
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

314
- Ross, it's too hard.
- No, no.

315
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

316
Who cares about them? This is about us.

317
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

318
- You're, like, my best friend.
- I know.

319
- If we broke up, and I lost you...
- Whoa.

320
Why do you think we'll break up?

321
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

322
No.

323
But it only has to happen once.

324
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

325
Right?

326
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

327
I don't know.

328
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

329
Well start looking.

330
Wow.

331
Exactly!

332
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

333
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

334
- Right.
- Heh.

335
You're right.

336
- You know what?
- What?

337
I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

338
I am so sorry. I'm so...

339
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

340
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

341
But...

342
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

343
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

344
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

345
There's no Rachel!

346
- Oh, hey. I got that.
- Oh.

347
- Thanks, sweetie.
- No problem.

348
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

349
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

350
No, they will. I just, uh...

351
- Can't wait. Heh.
- Can't wait.

352
Come on, they're gonna love you.

﻿1
- Hi, guys.
JOEY: Hey, Phoebe.

2
Hey, oh, how did it go?

3
Um, not so good.

4
He walked me to the subway and said,
"We should do this again."

5
- Ouch.
- What? He said, "We should do it again."

6
That's good, right?

7
Uh, no. Loosely translated,
"We should do this again," means:

8
"You will never see me naked."

9
Since when?

10
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

11
You know, like, "It's not you,"
means, "It is you."

12
"You're such a nice guy," means:

13
"I'm gonna be dating
leather-wearing alcoholics...

14
...and complaining about them to you."

15
Or, you know, um, "I think we should see
other people," means:

16
"Ha, ha, I already am."

17
And everybody knows this?

18
Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.

19
Like when you're a kid
and your parents put your dog to sleep...

20
...and they tell you it went off
to live on some farm.

21
That's funny.
No, because, uh, our parents actually did...

22
...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

23
Uh, Ross?

24
Ha, ha. Hello.
The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

25
The Milners,
they had this unbelievable farm.

26
They had horses and rabbits
that he could chase.

27
And it was...

28
Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.

29
CHANDLER: "So how does it feel
knowing you're about to die?"

30
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

31
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

32
- Hey, that was really good.
- Yeah?

33
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Let's keep going.

34
Okay. "So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?"

35
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell, I can smoke.

36
"Smoke away."

37
Heh.

38
[COUGHING]

39
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

40
- What?
- Relax your hand.

41
Let your wrist go.

42
- Not so much.
- Whoa.

43
Hey.

44
All right. Now try taking a puff.

45
Right.

46
- Okay, no, give it to me.
- No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.

47
No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want
to get this part or not? Here.

48
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

49
Think of it as the thing
that has been missing from your hand.

50
When you're holding it, you feel right.

51
- You feel complete.
- You miss it?

52
No, not so much.

53
All right. Now we smoke.

54
Oh, my God.

55
No, no, no.

56
They say it's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

57
...to the tip of his index finger.

58
That's ridiculous.

59
Can I use either thumb?

60
All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

61
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

62
Coffee, black.

63
Latte.

64
And an iced tea.

65
- I'm getting pretty good at this.
- Excellent. That's very good.

66
Good for me.

67
[MUMBLING]

68
- You okay, Phoebe?
- Yeah, no, it's not even worth...

69
It's my bank.

70
What did they do to you?

71
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.

72
I'm going through my mail,
and I open up their monthly "statement."

73
Easy.

74
And there's 500 extra dollars
in my account.

75
Oh, Satan's minions at work again.

76
Yes, because now I have to go down there
and deal with them...

77
- What are you talking about? Keep it.
- It's not mine.

78
I didn't earn it.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.

79
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

80
Okay. Okay.

81
Let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

82
Do you know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

83
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

84
And even if I was happy, okay,
and skipping...

85
...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."

86
We're with you. We got it.

87
Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

88
Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.

89
What are you doing?

90
Oh, gross.

91
- What is this?
- I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.

92
I can't believe you.
You've been so good for three years.

93
And this is my reward.

94
Hold on a second. Just think about what
you went through the last time you quit.

95
Okay, so this time I won't quit.

96
- Put it out.
- All right. I'm putting it out.

97
Oh, no.

98
I can't drink this now.

99
All right, I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

100
Is this Alan again? How's it going?

101
It's going pretty good, you know?
It's nice and we're having fun.

102
- So when do we get to meet the guy?
ROSS: Yeah.

103
Let's see, today's Monday...

104
- Never.
- Come on.

105
- No, not after what happened with Steve.
- What are you talking about?

106
[LISPING]
We love Steve. Steve was sexy.

107
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Sorry.

108
Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet.
Give me a chance to figure it out.

109
Well, then can we meet him?

110
No.

111
[LISPING]
Sorry.

112
Why should I let them meet him?

113
I bring a guy home and within five minutes
they're all over him.

114
I mean, they're like coyotes picking off
the weak members of the herd.

115
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

116
...I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

117
Come on, they're your friends.
They're looking out after you.

118
I know, I know. I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

119
Well, you do realize that the odds
of that happening are a little slimmer...

120
...if they never get to meet the guy.

121
Let it go, Ross.

122
Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi.

123
MONICA:
Do you all promise?

124
- Yeah, we promise. We'll be good.
JOEY: We promise.

125
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

126
[THUNDER CRASHING]

127
You can come in, but your filter tip
little buddy has to stay outside.

128
ROSS:
Hey, Pheebs.

129
"Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you
for calling attention to our error.

130
We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

131
...and hope you'll accept
this football phone...

132
...as our free gift." Do you believe this?

133
Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

134
What bank is this?

135
[DOOR BUZZES]

136
Okay, it's him.

137
- Who is it?
ALAN: Alan.

138
Chandler. He's here.

139
Okay, please be good. Please?

140
I mean, remember how much
you like me.

141
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

142
Hi. Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

143
- Hi.
GROUP: Hey.

144
[LISPING] I've heard so much
about all you guys.

145
MONICA:
Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.

146
Okay.

147
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

148
Who's gonna take the first shot?

149
Hmm?

150
Come on.

151
I'll go.

152
Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...

153
You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

154
Can't do it. We loved him.

155
GROUP: We loved him.
- Wait a minute.

156
We're talking about someone
that I'm going out with?

157
GROUP: Yes.
- And did you notice?

158
GROUP:
Yeah.

159
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kind of crooked.

160
Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.

161
What shoe?

162
From the nursery rhyme.

163
"There was a crooked man
who had a crooked smile...

164
...who lived in a shoe for a while..."

165
So I think Alan...

166
...will become the yardstick...

167
...against which all future boyfriends
will be measured.

168
What future boyfriends?

169
No, no. I think this could be,
you know, "it."

170
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

171
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

172
You know I'm gonna be doing that
at parties, right?

173
- You know what I like most about him?
- What?

174
The way he makes me feel about myself.

175
ALL:
Yeah.

176
Hi.

177
How was the game?

178
Well...

179
- We won!
- We won! Thank you! Yeah.

180
Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

181
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

182
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

183
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

184
I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

185
Yep. We sure showed
those Hasidic jewelers...

186
...a thing or two about softball.
- Nice.

187
Can I ask you guys a question?

188
Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes...

189
- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

190
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

191
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

192
- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

193
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, Weird Girl.

194
- I brought you alphabet soup.
- Did you pick out the vowels?

195
Yes, but I left in the Y's.
Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

196
Um, I also have something else for you.

197
Saltines?

198
No, but would you like $1000
and a football phone?

199
What?

200
Oh, my God.

201
- Oh, my God. There's really money in here.
- I know.

202
Weird Girl, what are you doing?

203
Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

204
No, no. I have to give you something.

205
No, it's fine. You don't...

206
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

207
No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

208
Please. Let me do something.

209
Okay, all right. I'll tell you what.

210
You buy me a soda
and then we're even. Okay?

211
- Okay.
PHOEBE: Okay.

212
Keep the change.

213
Thanks, Lizzy.

214
Sure you don't want a pretzel?

215
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

216
Huh.

217
A thumb?

218
GROUP:
Ew.

219
I know, I know.
I opened it up and there it was...

220
...just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitchhiker.

221
Maybe it's a contest, you know?
Like "Collect all five."

222
Does, um, anyone wanna see?

223
No, thanks.

224
- Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on.
- Cut that out.

225
It's worse than the thumb.

226
Hey, this is so unfair.

227
- Why is it unfair?
- So I have a flaw. Big deal.

228
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

229
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word.

230
And Monica, with that snort
when she laughs.

231
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

232
I accept all those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

233
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

234
Well...

235
...I could live without it.

236
Huh.

237
Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

238
Now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right?
I think it's endearing.

239
Oh, you do, do you?

240
[LAUGHING]

241
[SNORTS]

242
You know, there's nothing wrong
with speaking correctly.

243
Indeed there isn't.

244
I should really get back to work.

245
Yeah, otherwise someone might
get what they actually ordered.

246
Oh. The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

247
[GROUP SHOUTING]

248
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

249
No.

250
Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

251
We talking about the coyotes here?

252
Heh. All right. A cow got through.

253
Can you believe it?

254
It's just, you know what?

255
I just don't feel the thing.

256
I mean, they feel the thing.
I don't feel the thing.

257
Honey, you should always...

258
...feel the thing.

259
Listen, if that's how you feel
about the guy, Monica, dump him.

260
I know, it's just gonna be really hard.

261
Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll get over it.

262
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.

263
Do you have any respect for your body?

264
Don't you realize
what you're doing to yourself?

265
Hey, you know, I've had it
with you and your cancer...

266
...and your emphysema
and your heart disease.

267
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

268
Ahem. Chandler?

269
It's Alan. He wants to speak to you.

270
Really? He does?

271
Hey, buddy. What's up?

272
Oh, she told you about that, huh?

273
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

274
Well, it's not that bad...

275
Well, that's true.

276
Gee, you know, no one's
ever put it like that before.

277
Well, okay. Thanks.

278
God, he's good.

279
If only he were a woman.

280
Yeah.

281
CHANDLER:
Oh, Lamb Chop.

282
How old is that sock?

283
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

284
Okay, I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

285
Hey.

286
Where's Joey?

287
Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.

288
Do you think that was wrong?

289
- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

290
There you go.

291
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

292
Hey, Pheebs, you gonna
have the rest of that Pop Tart?

293
Does anyone want the rest
of this Pop Tart?

294
Hey, I might.

295
I'm sorry.

296
You know, those stupid soda people
gave me $7000 for the thumb.

297
- Oh, my God.
- Seven thousand dollars?

298
And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.

299
What is up with the universe?

300
What's going on?

301
Nothing. I just think it's nice
when we're all here together.

302
It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

303
- Uh, Joey...
- Oh.

304
MONICA: Okay.
- Oh, come on.

305
Please, guys, we have to talk.

306
Wait, wait. I'm getting a déjà vu.

307
No, I'm not.

308
- All right, we have to talk.
- There it is.

309
Okay, it's about Alan.

310
There's something you should know.

311
Oh, man, there's really
no easy way to say this. Uh...

312
I've decided to break up with Alan.

313
Is there somebody else?

314
No, no, no. It's just...

315
...you know, things change.
People change.

316
We didn't change.

317
So that's it? It's over?

318
Just like that?

319
You know, you let your guard down.

320
You know, you start to really care
about someone, and I just...

321
- Look, I could go on pretending...
- Okay.

322
No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...

323
...it wouldn't be fair to Alan,
or to you.

324
Yeah, well, who wants fair?

325
I mean, I just want things back,
you know, the way they were.

326
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

327
I just can't believe this.

328
I mean, with the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

329
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

330
Yeah, right.

331
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- Hey, hey. We'll be fine.

332
We're just gonna need a little time.

333
I understand.

334
Wow.

335
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry too.

336
But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.

337
- Relieved?
- Yeah, well...

338
...I mean, I had a great time with you.

339
I just can't stand your friends.

340
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

341
That was fun.

342
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

343
- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

344
So how'd it go?

345
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

346
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

347
ROSS:
You had a rough day, huh?

348
- Oh, you have no idea.
ROSS: Come here.

349
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
GROUP: No, no, no.

350
I don't care. I don't care.

351
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

352
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

353
Yeah, all right.

﻿1
PHOEBE:
Oh, that's good.

2
- Okay. All right, Phoebe?
- Okay, okay.

3
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace...

4
...no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

5
And bigger boobs.

6
Well, see, you took mine, so...

7
Chandler, what about you?

8
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

9
Heh. See, there's always one guy.

10
"If I had a wish,
I'd wish for three more wishes."

11
[ALL CHUCKLE]

12
ROSS & MONICA: Hey, Joey.
- Hey, buddy.

13
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

14
Probably kill myself.

15
Excuse me?

16
Hey, if Little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live, you know?

17
Joey, uh, omnipotent.

18
You are?

19
Ross, I'm...

20
How does she do that?

21
I cannot sleep in a public place.

22
Would you look at her?

23
- She's so peaceful.
- Yeah.

24
[BOTH SCREAM]

25
What? What? Hi.

26
It's okay, you know.
You just nodded off again.

27
- Oh.
- What's going on with you?

28
- I got no sleep last night.
ROSS: Why?

29
My grandmother
has this new boyfriend...

30
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so...

31
And deaf.

32
So they're constantly having to reassure
each other that they're having a good time.

33
You have no idea how loud they are.

34
- You can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
- Thanks.

35
Ninety-five, 96, 97.

36
See, I told you.
Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

37
You got way too much free time, man.

38
Hey, there's the birthday boy.

39
Ross, check it out. Hockey tickets.

40
Rangers-Penguins tonight at the Garden.
We're taking you.

41
- Happy birthday, pal.
- We love you, man.

42
[ROSS CHUCKLES]

43
It's funny,
my birthday was seven months ago.

44
- So?
- So I'm guessing you had an extra ticket...

45
...and couldn't decide
which one of you got to bring a date? Huh?

46
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-is-Half-Empty?

47
Oh, my God. Oh.

48
Is today the 20th? October 20th?

49
- I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
- Oh.

50
What's wrong with the 20th?

51
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

52
Today's the day Carol and I...

53
...first consummated...

54
...our physical relationship.

55
We had sex.

56
You know what?
I better pass on the game.

57
I think I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

58
The hell with hockey. Let's all do that.

59
Come on, Ross. You, me, Joey, ice?

60
Guys' night out?
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

61
Huh? Huh? Huh?

62
- What are you doing?
- I have no idea.

63
Come on, Ross.

64
All right, all right.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

65
- You promise to buy me a big foam finger?
JOEY: You got it.

66
- All right.
- Look, look, look. My first paycheck.

67
[ALL CHATTERING]

68
Look at the window.
There's my name. Hi, me.

69
I remember the day
I got my first paycheck.

70
There was a cave-in in one of the mines,
and eight people were killed.

71
Wow, you worked in a mine?

72
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

73
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this.

74
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk for it.

75
And it was totally...

76
...not worth it.

77
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

78
I mean, what...? Chandler, look at that.

79
Oh, this is not that bad.

80
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

81
- You can totally, totally live on this.
MONICA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

82
By the way, great service today.

83
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.

84
MONICA: Terrific.
- It was excellent.

85
CHANDLER: Unbelievable.
And all that milk and stuff? Great.

86
CHANDLER & JOEY: Hockey.
- Hockey. Hockey.

87
CHANDLER & JOEY: Hockey.
- Hockey. Hockey. Hockey.

88

I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom.

93
What are you guys doing here?

94
Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here...

95
...and it's true.

96
Yeah.

97
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

98

I can't believe it.

99
I know, I know. I'm a duplex.

So, what's going on with you?

101
Well, guess who my dad's making partner
in his firm.

of news...

104

108
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass.

109
Oh. Oh.

110
We'll take a time-out while Messier stops
to look at some women's shoes.

111
Carol was wearing boots just like those
the night that we first...

112
...you know.

113
In fact, she, uh...

114
She never took them off. Ha, ha.

115
It's because we... Sorry. Sorry.

116
I can't believe...

117
[ROSS SIGHS]

118
- What?
- Peach pit.

119
Yes, bunny?

120
Peach pit.

121
- That night, we, uh, had...
- Peaches?

122
Actually, nectarines, but basically.

123
- Could've been a peach.
- Then we, uh...

124
Then we got dressed
and I walked her to...

125
...the bus stop.

126
I'm fine.

127
Hey, that woman's got an ass
like Carol's.

128
What?
I thought we were trying to find stuff.

129
Oh, come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

130
Well, the biggest news
is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

131
- All right, let's talk reality for a second.
- Okay.

132
- When are you coming home?
- What?

133
Guys, I'm not.

134
- Heh. Come on. This is us.
- I'm not.

135
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

136
Waitressing?

137
Heh. I'm not just waitressing.

138
I mean, I'm...

139
I, um...

140
I write the specials
on the specials board.

141
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

142
Um, oh, and sometimes Arturo lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

143
Well, your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

145
MONICA:
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

146
[MONICA & PHOEBE SHRIEK]

147
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki Death Punch?

148
What's that?

149
- Well, it's rum and...
- Okay.

150
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

151
We got some trashy magazines,
we got cookie dough, we got Twister.

152
[PHONE RINGS]

153
Ooh, ooh. And I brought Operation.

154
But I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

155
But we can prep the guy.

156
Rach, it's the Visa-card people.

157
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

158
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

159
Yes, hold on.

160
Um, they say there's been unusual activity
on your account.

161
- But I haven't used my card in weeks.
- That is the unusual activity.

162
They just wanna see if you're okay.

163
They wanna know if I'm okay?

164
Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

165
Well, let's see.
The FICA guys took all my money.

166
Everyone I know is either getting married
or getting pregnant or getting promoted...

167
...and I'm getting coffee.

168
And it's not even for me.

169
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
then you can tell them I'm okay. Okay?

170
Uh, Rachel has left the building.

171
- Can you call back?
- All right. Come on.

172
[IN STRAINED VOICE]
Let's play Twister.

173
["CHARGE" PLAYING ON SPEAKERS]

174
- Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

175
Uh-oh.

176
What? There was ice there
that night with Carol?

177
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

178
No, actually, I was just saying
it looks like we're not sitting together.

179
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

180
It was the first frost.

181
- We were...
- Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

182
You should feel great.

183
You're doing this amazing
independent thing.

184
Monica, what is so amazing?

185
I gave up like everything. And for what?

186
You are just like Jack.

187
Jack from downstairs?

188
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

189
- Ah, the other Jack.
- Yeah, right.

190
See, he gave up something,
but then he got those magic beans.

191
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant...

192
...outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

193
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

194
Okay, but, Pheebs, Pheebs,
Jack gave up a cow.

195
I gave up an orthodontist.

196
Okay, I know I didn't love him, but...

197
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

198
But, see, it was a plan, you know?
It was clear.

199
Everything was figured out,
and now everything's just kind of like...

200
- Flupie?
- Yeah.

201
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

202
You gotta figure, at some point,
it's gonna come together...

203
...and it's just gonna be "unflupie."

204
Yeah, like that's a word.

205
Okay, but, Monica,
what if it doesn't come together?

206
Pheebs?

207
Well, because you just...
I don't like this question.

208
Okay, see? See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

209
I mean, what if all we've got are...

210
...beans?

211
Get him! Get him! Get him!

212
Get... Yes!
You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

213
That's all you need, a bunch of toothless
guys hitting each other with sticks.

214
Pass it. Pass it.

215
CHANDLER: He's open, he's open.
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

216
[ROSS GROANS]

217
- Whoa. Oh.
- Whoa.

218
- Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

219
- I got it!
- Hey, hey, we got it! Hey!

220
Excuse me.

221
It says to call this number if you're not
completely satisfied with this candy bar.

222
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

223
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

224
I guess you'd know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

225
[CHANDLER CHUCKLES]

226
Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there.

227
ROSS: Look, I don't wanna
make any trouble, okay?

228
But I'm in a lot of pain here, all right?
My face is dented.

229
- Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
- Well, how long do you think it'll be?

230
Any minute now.

231
[LAUGHS]

232
ROSS:
Hey, listen... Ooh.

233
[MELANCHOLY POP SONG PLAYING
ON STEREO]

234
I wake up and I start to cry

235
Ain't no hope in...

236
Oh. I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

237
No, you were right.

238
I don't have a plan.

239
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

240
MAN:
Pizza guy.

241
- Thank God.
- Food.

242
- Phoebe?
PHOEBE: What?

243
- Do you have a plan?
- I don't even have a "pla."

244
Hi. One mushroom,
green pepper and onion?

245
No, no, no. That's not what we ordered.

246
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese.

247
- Wait, you're not G. Stephanopoulos?
- No.

248
- Oh, man. My dad's gonna kill me.
- Wait.

249
Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

250
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I must have given him yours.

251
Oh, bonehead. Bonehead.

252
Wait, was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

253
Yeah, that sounds about right.

254
- Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
- And a power tie?

255
No, pretty much just a towel.

256
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Oh.

257
- Oh, my God.
- You want me to take this back?

258
What? Are you nuts?
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza.

259
Here.

260
- Uh, Pheebs?
- Yeah?

261
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

262
That's Big Bird's friend.

263
[LAUGHS]

264
I see pizza.

265
PHOEBE:
Oh, I wanna see. Let me see. Let me see.

266
Hello? Who are we spying on?

267
You know the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

268
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

269
Oh, him. The little guy. Oh, I love him.

270
Ooh. Oh, wait. Wait, I see a woman.

271
Tell me it's his mother.

272
- Definitely not his mother.
- Oh, no.

273
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.

274
She's walking, she's walking.

275
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

276
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Dr. Max to Center 456.

277
Dr. Max to Center 456.

278
[WHOOSHES]

279
Excuse me.
We've been here for over an hour...

280
...and people less sick than my friend
have gone in.

281
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

282
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

283
I know we both said some things...

284
...we didn't mean...

285
...but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

286
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

287
[YELLS]

288
- Lights still out?
- Yeah.

289
Well, maybe they're napping.

290
Heh. Please. They're having sex.

291
MONICA & PHOEBE:
Shut up.

292
So, what do you think George is like?

293
- I think he's shy.
- Oh, yeah?

294
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

295
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.

296
[ALL LAUGHING]

297
Come on.

298
I remember the moonlight coming in
through the open window...

299
...and her face
had the most incredible glow.

300
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

301
You did this part.

302
Could I get some painkillers over here,
please?

303
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

304
So you slept with her for the first time.
So what?

305
You slept with her
for seven years after that.

306
It's just a little more complicated
than that.

307
What? What is it? That she left you?
That she likes women?

308
That she left you for a woman
that likes women?

309
A little louder.

310
There's a man on the 12th floor in a coma
who didn't quite hear you.

311
Then what?

312
My first time with Carol was...

313
Was my...

314
[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]

315
What?

316
It was my first...

317
...time.

318
With Carol?

319
Oh.

320
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one?

321
Oh.

322
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

323
There's a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight.

324
Okay. Okay, I got one.

325
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté
that I made that you loved so much?

326
Uh-huh.

327
[MONICA & RACHEL GIGGLE]

328
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...

329
- Oh! Oh!
MONICA & RACHEL: Ha-ha-ha.

330
Okay, fine, fine.

331
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

332
- What? You slept with Jason?
- You had already broken up.

333
- How long?
- Just a couple hours.

334
Oh, that's nice.

335
Okay, okay, okay, I got one.

336
Anyway.

337
The valentine Tommy Rollerson left
in your locker was really from me.

338
Excuse me?

339
Oh, hello?
Like he was really gonna send you one.

340
She was a big girl.

341
[LAUGHS]

342
Really?

343
Well, at least big girls don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade.

344
I was laughing. You made me laugh.

345
Oh, my God.
There he is. There he is. There he is.

346
- Where?
- Right where we've been looking all night.

347
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Oh, George, baby, drop the towel.

348
- Come on, drop the towel.
RACHEL & PHOEBE: Drop the towel.

349
MONICA:
Please drop the towel. Drop it.

350
ALL:
Wow.

351
Man, can you believe he's only had sex
with one woman?

352
I think it's great.

353
You know, it's sweet. It's romantic.

354
Really?

355
No, are you kidding?
The guy's a freak. I judge him.

356
- Hey, man.
- Hey, buddy.

357
ROSS:
Ah? Ah?

358
Oh.

359
That's attractive.

360
Oh, I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

361
[JOEY LAUGHING]

362
Oh, come on, admit it,
all things considered, you had fun tonight.

363
Fun? Where was the fun?

364
Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part?

365
Where's my puck?

366
- Oh. The kid has it.
- The kid?

367
Ahem. Excuse me, uh, that's my puck.

368
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

369
You gotta do it, man.

370
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you...

371
I can't do it.

372
- Listen, uh, give me back my puck.
- No.

373
- Yes, how about?
- No.

374
- No, come here. Just give me my puck.
- No, no, no.

375
SIZEMORE:
Hey, no roughhousing in my ER.

376
Give me my puck! Unh.

377
[GRUNTS]

378
Now, that was fun.

379
ROSS:
Okay, Monica.

380
Right foot, red.

381
Could've played Monopoly, but no.

382
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

383
Thanks.

384
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

385
- Good.
JOEY: Hmm?

386
[PHONE RINGS]

387
Hello?

388
- Oh. Rachel, it's the Visa-card people.
RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

389
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

390
RACHEL: No.
- Oh.

391
Hello?

392
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.

393
Oh, well, thanks, but I'm okay, really.

394
To the green, to the green.

395
MONICA: Oh, no.
- To the green.

396
I've got magic beans.

397
No, no, never mind.

398
CHANDLER:
To the left. To the left.

399
[ALL YELL]

400
I'm fine.

﻿1
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
ROSS: Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
As far as I'm concerned...

6
...there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

8
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
You know what blows my mind?

10
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

11
You just look down,
and there they are.

12
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

13
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

14
...and then not even care.

15
Multiple orgasms!

16
So Saturday night, the big night.

17
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

18
- No plans, huh?
- Not a one.

19
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

20
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

21
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

22
- You just gotta do it.
- I know. But it's just so hard.

23
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

24
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

25
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26
Why do you have to break up with her?

27
Be a man. Just stop calling.

28
If you want, I'll do it with you.

29
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

30
I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

31
You're breaking up with Tony?

32
I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

33
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

34
Does anybody want anything else?

35
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...

36
Nothing. I'm fine.

37
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

38
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

39
That guy, he burns me up.

40
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

41
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

42
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

43
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

44
Yeah, I got the extended disco
version with three choruses of:

45
"You'll never make it on your own."

46
[SINGS]
Uh-huh, uh-huh

47
Hi, Joey.

48
Oh, my God. Angela.

49
Wow. Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

50
- Are you gonna go over there?
- No.

51
Yeah. No.

52
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

53
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

54
...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.

55
Hey, Angela.

56
Joey.

57
You look good.

58
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

59
You don't say.

60
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

61
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

62
Oh.

63
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
- Who?
- Me.

66
Was that not clear?

67
Hey, why don't...?

68
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
Yes.

71
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

72
Um... But there's a rat problem.

73
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

74
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

75
...fluffy.

76
Anyway, 7-ish?

77
Sure.

78
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

79
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

80
Bob is great.

81
He's smart, he's sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

82
You go on three auditions a month
and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...

83
Come on. We were great together.

84
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

85
Sorry, Joey. You said,
"Let's just be friends."

86
So guess what?

87
- What?
- We're just friends.

88
Fine. Fine.

89
So why don't the four of us go out and
have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

90
What "four of us"?

91
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend, um...

92
...Monica.

93
JOEY: Monica, I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

94
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

95
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

96
...ahem, brother.

97
He's smart, he's sophisticated...

98
...and he has a real job.

99
Me, I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

100
- Oh, God, help us.
- What?

101
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

102
BOTH:
Ew!

103
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

104
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother...

105
...maybe Angela will come back to me.

106
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

107
I know, but...

108
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

109
Will you help me? Please?

110
Okay. Bye.

111
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

112
[ROSS CHUCKLES]

113
Hold on there, camper.
You sure you've thought this through?

114
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

115
It's just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

116
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

117
Nuh-uh.

118
Yeah-huh.

119
What are you saying?

120
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine? What?

121
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

122
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

123
No.

124
And the fabric softener?

125
Okay, okay.
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

126
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

127
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

128
I can pick something else
up on the way.

129
MONICA:
Thank you.

130
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

131
Yep.

132
Which?

133
Which what?

134
You've never met Bob, have you?

135
No, but...

136
For all we know,
he could be horribly...

137
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

138
Where are they? Where are they?

139
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

140
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

141
Ew. I don't wanna do that.

142
- Here we go.
- Have a good breakup.

143
- Hey, Janice.
- My God, I am so glad you called me.

144
I had the most supremely awful day.

145
That's not good.

146
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

147
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

148
They sucked.

149
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

150
And I got you...

151
JANICE:
I'm looking. I'm looking.

152
I'm looking.

153
- I got you...
- What?

154
- What?
- What did you get me there?

155
I got you...

156
...these.

157
Bullwinkle socks.

158
- That's so sweet.
- I knew you had the Rockys.

159
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle...

160
...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

161
Moose and squirrel.

162
Whatever you want.

163
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

164
No.

165
No, I'm still working on mine.

166
[JANICE LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY]

167
That's it?

168
Yeah, it was really hard.

169
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

170
Okay, you weren't there.

171
WOMAN:
Coming through! Move! Move!

172
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

173
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

174
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

175
- I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
- Yes.

176
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

177
What?

178
No suds, no save, okay?

179
- What's going on?
- Hi.

180
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

181
Was your basket on top?

182
- Yeah, but there were no suds.
- So?

183
You know, no suds, no save.

184
No suds, no... Excuse me.

185
Hold on a second!

186
This is my friend's machine.

187
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

188
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

189
All right. Show's over.

190
Nothing to see here.

191
Okay. Let's do laundry.

192
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

193
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle...

194
Do you, uh?

195
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

196
- What's that?
- Überweiss.

197
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

198
Rach, do you...?
Are you gonna separate those?

199
Oh, God. Ugh.

200
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

201
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

202
Have you...?
Have you never done this before?

203
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

204
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

205
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

206
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

207
Okay...

208
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

209
Whites. Okay.

210
- A whole other machine for your colors.
- Colors.

211
And then a third for your, uh...

212
...delicates.
And that would be your bras...

213
...and your underpanty things.

214
Okay, well,
these are white cotton panties.

215
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

216
That would be a judgment call.

217
[ALL LAUGHING]

218
He's so cute!

219
So where did you guys grow up?

220
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Cleveland.

221
Ha. Heh, heh, heh.

222
- How did that happen?
- Oh, my God!

223
What?

224
I suddenly had the feeling I was...

225
...falling.

226
But I'm not.

227
So you and Angela, huh?

228
Yep. Pretty much.

229
- You're a lucky man.
- Yeah.

230
You know what I miss
the most about her?

231
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

232
Like a happy little squirrel...

233
...or a weasel.

234
I never really noticed.

235
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

236
Monica. Monica is great.

237
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

238
But it's not gonna last.

239
She's too much for me in bed.

240
Sexually.

241
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

242
Yeah, isn't he?

243
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny...

244
...and has an emotional age beyond 8.

245
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

246
Wow!

247
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

248
Huh.

249
That's nice.

250
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

251
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

252
Go! Go!

253
Janice...

254
Hi, Janice.

255
Okay, here we go.
I don't think we should go out anymore.

256
Janice.

257
All right.

258
Well...

259
Well, there you go.

260
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

261
RACHEL: Okay, I know this is gonna sound
really stupid...

262
...but I feel that if I can do this...

263
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...

264
...there isn't anything I can't do.

265
That does not sound stupid to me.

266
No, it's like... The first time I had to make
dinner for myself after Carol left me...

267
[WASHER BUZZES]

268
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross...

269
[RACHEL LAUGHS]

270
Okay.

271
- Uh-oh.
- What, "uh-oh"?

272
Uh-oh...

273
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

274
It's a song.

275
The laundry song that we sing.

276
[SINGS]
Uh-oh, the laundry's done

277
What's the matter?

278
Nothing. Nothing.

279
[SINGS]
The laundry's done

280
Come on, show me.

281
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now...

282
...everything's kind of pink.
- Oh.

283
Everything's pink?

284
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

285
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

286
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

287
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

288
What am I doing? What am I doing?

289
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

290
I can't even do laundry!

291
[WOMAN LAUGHS]

292
[NIBBLING]

293
Something went wrong
with Underdog...

294
...and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

295
So anyway...

296
...his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

297
And I'm thinking...

298
...how inappropriate this is.

299
I've got something's in my eye.
Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

300
- Oh, my God!
- What?

301
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like...

302
...cocktails in Appalachia.

303
- Come on, they're close.
- Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

304
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

305
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

306
...not really true, is it?

307
Who's to say what's true?

308
What were you thinking?

309
Look, I'm not proud of this, okay?

310
Well, maybe I am a little.

311
- Oh.
- Ow!

312
- I'm out of here!
- Wait! Come on!

313
You like him. I want her.

314
He likes you.

315
- Really?
- Yeah.

316
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us...

317
...we can break them up.

318
MONICA: I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

319
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

320
[NIBBLING]

321
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

322
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

323
I'm the bing, you're the boom...

324
JANICE: Ow!
- Oh!

325
- Oh, my God!
- Ow!

326
- I'm so sorry!
- Ow!

327
- Are you okay?
- Ow!

328
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

329
I'll be right back.

330
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

331
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

332
Oh, my God.

333
How many of those have you had?

334
I don't know. A million!

335
Chandler, shh, shh. Easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

336
[HUMMING]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

337
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- All right.

338
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

339
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

340
[PHOEBE & JANICE SPEAKING
INAUDIBLEY]

341
How do you do that?

342
It's like a gift.

343
We should always, always break up
together.

344
I'd like that.

345
ROSS: You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

346
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

347
Whoa, I'm sorry.

348
Excuse me. We had this cart.

349
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

350
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

351
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

352
Hey, hey, hey.
There aren't any clothes in it!

353
Hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

354
Let go! Come on, this is my cart.
You know I saw it first.

355
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart...

356
...you're gonna have to
take me with it!

357
Yes! Did you see that?

358
You were incredible.

359
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

360
I could not have
done this without you.

361
ROSS:
Okay, um...

362
Uh... More clothes in the dryer?

363
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

364
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

365
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah.

366
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

367
MONICA:
Hi!

368
PHOEBE:
How'd it go?

369
Excellent!

370
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

371
What a beautiful story.

372
I'm fine, by the way.

373
I'm sorry.

374
- Where's Chandler?
- He needed some time to grieve.

375
CHANDLER:
I'm free! I'm free!

376
That ought to do it.

﻿1
Oh, look, look!
There's Joey's picture!

2
This is so exciting!

3
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
The exclamation point scares me.

6
It's not just Freud,
it's Freud!

7
ROSS:
Shh. Magic is about to happen!

8
JOEY [IN GERMAN ACCENT]:
Well, Eva...

9
...we've done
some excellent work here.

10
And I would have to say...

11
...your problem is quite clear.

12
[ZANY PIANO MUSIC PLAYS]

13
[SINGING]
All you want is a dinkle

14
What you envy's a schwang

15
A thing through which you can tinkle

To play with or simply let hang

[ALL GROAN]

19
I feel violated.

20
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

21
...to have something else to do?

22
Ross, 10:00.

23
Is it? It feels like 2.

24
No, 10:00!

25
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 10:00!

26
ROSS:
Hello!

27
She's amazing!

28
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

29
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

30
And what would my opening line be?

31
Excuse me...

32
[BABBLES]

33
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

34
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

35
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

36
But you always see these beautiful
women with these "nothing" guys.

37
You could be one of those guys.

38
- You could do that.
- You think?

39
RACHEL:
Absolutely!

40
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

41
- I'm very aware of my tongue.
- Come on.

42
Here goes.

43
Yes?

44
Hi. Um... Ahem.

45
Okay, next word would be...

46
...uh, Chandler.

47
Chandler is my name and, uh...

48
[CLEARS THROAT]

49
Hi!

50
Yes, you said that.

51
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say...

52
What I wanted to say was, uh...

53
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

54
Chandler?

55
PHOEBE:
There he is!

56
ROSS: I didn't know you could dance!
RACHEL: You were in a play!

57
What'd you think?

58
ROSS: I didn't know you could dance!
RACHEL: You were in a play!

59
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

60
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

61
RACHEL: You're right.
ROSS: We saw your head.

62
She said yes! She said yes!

63
MONICA:
Wow!

64
Awful play, man! Whoa!

65
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian
and she pronounces my name "Chandler."

66
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.

67
- What is it?
- The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

68
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

69
Based on this play?

70
Based on this play!

71
Hey, kids!

72
ROSS:
Hey, Chandler.

73
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

74
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

75
How was your date, Chandler?

76
It was unbelievable!

77
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

78
CHANDLER:
She was in the Israeli army.

79
None of the bullets hit
the engine block...

80
...so we made it to the border.

81
But just barely and I...

82
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

83
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

84
All right, once...

85
...once I got on the subway, right?

86
And it was at night...

87
...and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn...

88
...just for the hell of it.

89
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

90
More or less.

91
Suddenly, we realized
we were in Yemen.

92
I'm sorry, so "we" is?

93
"We" is me and Rick.

94
- Who's Rick?
- Who's Rick?

95
My husband.

96
ALL:
Ooh.

97
- Oh, so you're divorced?
- No.

98
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

99
No, I'm still married.

100
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

101
...sliding your foot
so far up my leg...

102
...you can count
the change in my pocket?

103
Don't worry.

104
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

105
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

106
Ethan is my...

107
...boyfriend.

108
ALL:
What?

109
So, uh, what kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

110
...if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

111
I suppose, mainly sexual.

112
Huh.

113
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

114
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

115
Didn't you listen to the story?

116
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

117
I had trouble with it at first,
but I get all the good stuff.

118
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

119
...and no responsibility.

120
This is every guy's fantasy!

121
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

122
No, of course not.

123
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

124
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

125
I couldn't.

126
Good for you.

127
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know...

128
...that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

129
You know...

130
...monogamy can be a tricky concept.

131
I mean, anthropologically...

132

133
Fine. Now you'll never know.

134
We're kidding. Tell us.

put forth by Richard Leakey...

[ROSS GROANS]

138
Ta-da!

139
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

140
Look! I cleaned!

141
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

142
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

143
I don't know what it's for.

144
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.

145
RACHEL:
What do you think?

146
CHANDLER: It's very clean.
MONICA: Really, it looks great!

147
Oh. Heh.
I see you moved the green ottoman.

148
ROSS & PHOEBE:
Uh-oh.

149
How did that happen?

150
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

151
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

152
Yeah, it's interesting.

153
But you know what? Just for fun...

154
...let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

155
Just to compare.

156
Let's see. Ha!

157
Well, it looks good there too.

158
Let's leave it there for a while.

159
I can't believe you tried
to move the green ottoman.

160
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

161
She'll scratch your eyes out.

162
You guys, I am not that bad!

163
Yeah, you are.

Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

170
But, hey, I can be a kook!

171
All right, you madcap gal!

172
Try to imagine this.

173
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

174
- Why not?
- Because you're a kook!

175
Instead, you wait until
they send you a notice.

176
I could do that.

177
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping...

178
...and I buy laundry detergent.

179
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

180
Why would someone do that?

181
One might wonder.

182
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

183
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

their way closer to the wood...

in the new Al Pacino movie!

195

Whoa! That's great!

196
What's the part?

197
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!

You're out of order!

they pull me back in!"

205

What?

206
I'm his butt double, okay?

207
I play Al Pacino's butt.

208

into the shower, and then...

209
...I'm his butt.

to crack your way into show business.

- For what?

what you did in there.

I warned you.

231
Who is being loud?

232
Oh, that would be Monica.

233
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

234
You got the whole night, huh?

235
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so...

236
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

237
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me...

238
...it's worth it, okay?

239
In a relationship,
you have these key moments...

240
...you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

241
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.

242
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.

243
So, uh, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

244
Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica
would remind you...

245
...to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

246
But I'm not gonna do that.

247
DIRECTOR:
Damn it! Hire the girl.

248
Okay, everybody ready?

249
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

250
Lose the robe.

251
Me?

252
That would work.

253
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

254
Okay, and the robe is lost.

255
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

256
Let's roll it.

257
Water's working.

258
And action!

259
And cut!

260
Butt guy, what are you doing?

261
I'm showering.

262
No, that was clenching.

263
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

264
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

265
I think his butt would be angry here.

266
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

267
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

268
And action!

269
And cut! What was that?

270
I was going for quiet desperation.

271
But if you have to ask...

272
God, I love these fingers.

273
Thank you.

274
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

275
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

276
- Oh, my God, I'm late!
- Oh, no, no, no.

277
- Don't go, don't go.
- Okay, okay.

278
- I have to.
- Look, she's leaving.

279
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

280
I thought you talked to Rick.

281
It's not Rick.

282
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!

283
No, it's Andrew.

284
I know there'll be many moments...

285
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but...

286
And Andrew is?

287
He's... new.

288
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

289
No, that's not exactly what I was...

290
Most women would kill...

291
...for three guys like us.

292
So, what do you want?

293
You.

294
- You have me.
- No, no. Just you.

295
What do you mean?

296
Lose the other guys.

297
Like, all of them?

298
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

299
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

300
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love...

301
...without feeling obligated
to one another?

302
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

303
Well, part of me wants that...

304
...but it's like I'm two guys.

305
I mean, one guy's saying,
"Shut up! This is great!"

306
But there's this other guy.

307
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart...

308
...grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.

309
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out, get out!"

310
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

311
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

312
Which one?

313
The second guy.

314
I see.

315
Call me if you change your mind.

316
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

317
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

318
Right? I mean, this woman was...

319
...unbelievably sexy...

320
...and beautiful,
intelligent, unattainable...

321
Tell me why you did this again?

322
ROSS: Hey!
MONICA: Hey!

323
RACHEL:
Movie star!

324
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

325
Nope.

326
No? What happened, big guy?

327
Big guy?

328
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

329
I got fired!

330
They said I acted too much with it.

331
I told everybody about this.

332
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.

333
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

334
My mom will.

335
There's something so sweet...

336
...and disturbing about that.

337
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years...

338
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

339
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

340
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

341
Did it feel like your shot?

342
Hard to tell. I was naked.

343
I don't think this was your shot.

344
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

345
I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.

346
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go...

347
..."I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

348
You think? That's so nice.

349
Oh, come here.

350
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

351
ROSS:
Good night.

352
RACHEL: You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

353
Uh-huh.

354
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

355
...in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

356
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

357
Whenever.

358
She is a kook.

359
[HUMMING]

360
MONICA [THINKING]: If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes.

361
No, don't do this!

362
This is stupid!

363
I don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

364
But then everyone will know.

365
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

366
I need help!

﻿1
Everybody. Shh. Uh, Central Perk
is proud to present...

2
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
PHOEBE:
Thanks.

4
Hi. Um, I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

5
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
Okay, here we go.

7
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
CHANDLER:
What...?

9
Oh, great. This is just...

10
This is so cool, you guys.

11
The entire city's blacked out.

12
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens...

13
...and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.

14
PHOEBE: Wow.
RACHEL: You guys, this is big.

15
Pants and a sweater.
Why, Mom?

16
Who will I meet in a blackout?

17
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

18
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

19
Can I borrow the phone?

20
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

21
What's my number?

22
I never call me.

23
CHANDLER [THINKING]:
Oh, my God. It's her.

24
It's that Victoria Secret model.

25
Something Goodacre.

26
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

27
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.

28
Oh, my God.

29
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

30
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium?

31
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

32
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

33
Jill says vestibule...

34
...I'm going with vestibule.

35
JILL:
I'm fine.

36
No, I'm not alone.

37
I don't know. Some guy.

38
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

39
Hey, Jill, I saw you
with some guy last night.

40
Yes, he was some guy.

41
JOEY:
Hey, everyone.

42
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

43
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have...

44
...so happy Hanukkah.

45
PHOEBE: Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

46
ALL:
Ooh.

47
Oh!

48
Ooh. That had to hurt.

49
CHANDLER [THINKING]: All right, all right.
It's been 14 and a half minutes...

50
...and you still haven't said
one word. Oh, God.

51
Do something.
Just make contact. Smile.

52
There you go.

53
You're definitely scaring her.

54
Uh, would you like to call somebody?

55
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

56
Yeah, thanks.

57
[PHONE RINGS]

58
Hello?

59
- It's me.
- It's Chandler.

60
Are you okay?

61
Yeah, I'm fine.

62
[MUMBLING]
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...

63
...with Jill Goodacre.

64
What?

65
[MUMBLING]
I'm stuck...

66
...in an ATM vestibule...

67
...with Jill Goodacre.

68
I have no idea what you said.

69
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Put Joey on the phone.

70
What's up, man?

71
[MUMBLING]
I'm stuck...

72
...in an ATM vestibule...

73
...with Jill Goodacre.

74
Oh, my God.

75
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

76
Chandler, listen.

77
[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]

78
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah, like that thought
never entered my mind.

79
RACHEL:
Come on, somebody.

80
MONICA:
I'll go. I'll go.

81
Okay, um, senior year of college,
on a pool table.

82
JOEY: Ooh.
- Pool table?

83
That's my sister.

84
Okay, okay.
My weirdest place would have to be...

85
...the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.

86
Oh, my God. What were you
doing in a library?

87
- Pheebs, what about you?
- Oh, um, Milwaukee.

88
Uh, Ross?

89
[CLEARS THROAT]

90
Disneyland, 1989.
"It's a small world after all."

91
No way.

92
The, uh, ride broke down...

93
...so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.

94
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

95
Ooh. Rachel?

96
I already went.

97
- You did not go.
- Yes, I did.

98
MONICA:
Tell us. Come on.

99
All right, uh, the weirdest place
would have to be...

100
...the foot of the bed.

101
- Step back.
- We have a winner.

102
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

103
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.

104
It was the only thing to do there
that didn't have a line.

105
Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature-golf course.

106
- Come on.
- No.

107
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.

108
And you didn't marry him because?

109
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

110
...never having that kind of?

111
- Probably.
- Really?

112
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

113
- Yeah, right.
- It is.

114
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

115
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and, uh...

116
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

117
For all those people who miss out
on that, uh, passion thing...

118
...there's other good stuff.

119
Okay.

120
But, um, I don't think that'll be you.

121
- You don't?
- Mm-mm.

122
See, I see, uh...

123
...big passion in your future.

124
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

125
- You do?
- I do.

126
Ross, you're so great.

127
ROSS:
Ah.

128
It's never gonna happen.

129
- What?
- You and Rachel.

130
[CHUCKLES]

131
[STUTTERS]

132
Why not?

133
Because you waited too long
to make your move...

134
...and now you're in the "Friend Zone."

135
No, no, no.
I'm not in the Zone.

136
No, Ross.
You're mayor of the Zone.

137
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

138
I'm laying the groundwork.

139
Every day I get
a little bit closer to, uh...

140
Priesthood.

141
Ross, I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

142
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.

143
I will, I will.

144
I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.

145
What?

146
- What, now?
- Yeah.

147
What's messing you up?
The wine?

148
The candles? The moonlight? Huh?

149
You gotta go up to her and say,
"Look, Rachel, I think..."

150
- Shh!
- Shh!

151
- What are we shushing?
- We're shushing...

152
...because we're trying to
hear something.

153
- What?
- Uh, don't you hear that?

154
Ah.

155
- See?
- Huh.

156
- Would you like some gum?
- Oh. Is it sugarless?

157
- Uh, sorry, it's not.
- Then, no, thanks.

158
CHANDLER [THINKING]:
What the hell was that?

159
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

160
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it.

161
PHOEBE [SINGING]:
New York City has no power

162
And the milk is getting sour

163
But to me it is not scary

164
'Cause I stay away from dairy

165
La-la
La-la-la-la-la

166
- Here goes.
- You'll do it?

167
- I'll do it.
- Want help?

168
You come out there,
you're a dead man.

169
Ross, Ross.

170
Good luck, man.

171
Thanks.

172
- Okay.
- Okay.

173
JOEY: Where you going?
MONICA: Outside.

174
You can't go out there.

175
- Why not?
- Because of, uh, the reason.

176
And that would be?

177
I, uh... I can't tell you.

178
What's going on?

179
Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

180
- About what?
- He's planning your birthday party.

181
Oh, my God. I love him.

182
You better act surprised.

183
- About what?
- My surprise party.

184
- What surprise party?
- Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

185
Well, he didn't tell me.

186
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.

187
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.

188
- You are not. We tell you stuff.
- Uh-huh.

189
I was the last one to know when Chandler
got bit by the peacock at the zoo.

190
I was the last to know you had a crush
on Joey when he was moving in.

191
What?

192
Oh. Looks like I was second to last.

193
It's so nice.

194
Hey, I have a question.

195
Uh, actually, it's not
so much a question...

196
...it's more of a general wondering...

197
...ment.

198
- Okay.
- Okay.

199
Here goes.

200
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

201
- Oh.
- Yes, that's right.

202
Look at that little kitty.

203
What?

204
[YELLS]

205
ALL [SINGING]: I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation

206
And the only explanation I can find

207
Is the love that I found
Ever since you've been around

208
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

209
Ow. Ow.

210
Sorry, that was wax.

211
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.

212
Why not put "poor little Tootie"
in the hall?

213
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

214
Yeah?

215
You know, on second thought,
gum would be perfection.

216
CHANDLER [THINKING]:
Gum would be perfection?

217
Gum would be perfection.

218
Could've said, "Gum would be nice."
"I'll have a stick." But, no.

219
For me, gum is perfection.

220
I loathe myself.

221
Oh, no, the Mellons.
They hate all living things, right?

222
PHOEBE:
Oh.

223
Hi. We just found this cat...

224
...and we're looking for the owner.

225
Um, yeah, it's, uh... It's mine.

226
He seems to hate you.
Are you sure?

227
Yeah. It's my cat. Give me my cat.

228
Wait a minute. What's his name?

229
Um, Bob... Buttons.

230
- Bob Buttons?
- Uh-huh.

231
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.

232
Oh!

233
You are a very bad man.

234
You owe me a cat.

235
RACHEL:
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

236
Here, kitty, kitty.

237
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty, kitty?

238
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

239
Hi.

240
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

241
Wow.

242
Come on, lucky sixes.

243
Everybody, this is Paolo.

244
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

245
- This is Monica...
- Hi.

246
...and Joey...
MONICA: Hi.

247
...and Ross.
MONICA: Hi.

248
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

249
Ha, ha. He doesn't speak much English.

250
Monopoly.

251
Look at that.

252
So, uh...

253
Where did, uh, Paolo come from?

254
Italy, I think. Heh.

255
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Suddenly into our lives?

256
The cat turned out to be
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

257
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.

258
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

259
Oh, I found him.
It was Paolo's cat.

260
Ah. Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

261
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?

262
Oh. Paolo, this is Phoebe.

263
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

264
You betcha.

265
CHANDLER [THINKING]:
All right. Okay. What next?

266
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

267
It's got a, uh, boyish charm.
It's impish.

268
Here we go.

269
Nice going, imp.

270
Okay. It's okay. All I need to do is...

271
...reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

272
Good save.
We're back on track and I'm...

273
...chewing someone else's gum.

274
This is not my gum.

275
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

276
And now you're choking.

277
Are you all right?

278
Oh, my God.
You're choking.

279
Better?

280
Yes.

281
Thank you. That was...

282
That was...

283
Perfection?

284
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

285
[MIMICKING PAOLO]

286
[RACHEL LAUGHS]

287
What'd he say that was so funny?

288
I have absolutely no idea.

289
That's classic.

290
My God, you guys.
What am I doing?

291
This is so un-me.

292
If you want, I'll do it.

293
I know. I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

294
But I won't.

295
God. The first time he smiled at me...

296
...those three seconds were more exciting
than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

297
Did you rent mopeds?

298
Because I've heard...

299
Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.

300
I know it's totally superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

301
...and we don't even speak
the same language...

302
...but, God.

303
Paolo, hi.

304
- Ross.
- Listen, uh...

305
Listen, um, heh,
something you should, uh, know.

306
Rachel and I are...

307
We're kind of a thing.

308
- Thing?
- Thing. Yes, thing.

309
- You have the sex?
- No.

310
No, no. Um, technically,
the sex is not being had. But that's, uh...

311
That's not the point.

312
The point is that, uh,
Rachel and I should be, uh...

313
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.

314
And if you get in the, uh...

315
- In bed?
- No.

316
Ha. No, not where I was going.

317
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

318
...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.

319
Oh.

320
So do you, um?

321
[BOTH SPEAK IN ITALIAN]

322
- You do know a little English?
- Little.

323
Do you know the word crap-weasel?

324
No? That's funny,
you are a huge crap-weasel.

325
Chandler, we've been here for an hour
doing this. Watch, it's easy.

326
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

327
Okay? Now try it.

328
You gotta whip it.

329
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

330
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

331
...minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48...

332
ROSS: Thank you.
MONICA: Thanks.

333
ROSS:
Kind of spooky without any lights.

334
[JOEY LAUGHS MANIACALLY]

335
[ALL LAUGH MANIACALLY]

336
ROSS:
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

337
[ROSS LAUGHS MANIACALLY]

338
[GROANS]

339
Uh, Ross...

340
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

341
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

342
- This has been fun.
- Yes.

343
Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
use your phone...

344
...and for saving my life.

345
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

346
I had a great blackout.

347
See you.

348
Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
And I don't know if you got any of that...

349
...but I would really
like a copy of the tape.

﻿1
Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?

2
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
Does it get better than this?

4
Question: You're not dating, are you?

5
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
You see, perfect might be a problem.

7
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive...

8
- You want a date Saturday?
- Yes, please.

9
He is cute.

10
- He's funny. He's...
- He's a he?

11
Well, yeah.

12
Oh, God. I just...

13
You're nice... Oh, God.

14
Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

15
Okay. Bye-bye.

16
CHANDLER: It's hard to enjoy noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

17
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

18
Um...

19
Yeah.

20
Well, when I first met you,
I thought maybe...

21
...possibly...

22
...you might be.

23
You did?

24
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts...

25
...so then I figured maybe not.

26
Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

27
- I did.
- I think so.

28
- Not me.
- No, no, me neither.

29
Although, uh, back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

30
You're kidding.

31
- Did you tell her I wasn't?
- No.

32
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

33
So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman...

34
...who also liked her.

35
Well, this is fascinating.

36
So, uh, what is it about me?

37
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny...

38
Ross is smart and funny.
You ever think that about him?

39
- Ha, ha. Yeah, right.
- What is it?

40
Okay, I don't know. You just...
You have a quality.

41
- Yes, exactly.
- Right?

42
Yeah, a quality.

43
"A quality." Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

44
[PHONE RINGS]

45
Hello?

46
Oh. Rachel.

47
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

48
Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.

49
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

50
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

51
Just gotta go to Rome.

52
Monica, your dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

53
I'm talking to Rome.

54
Hey, Dad. What's up?

55
Oh, God.

56
Ross, it's Nana.

57
Hey.

58
MONICA: How you doing?
ROSS: Hey, Dad.

59
So, uh, how's she doing?

60
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

61
- How are you, Mom?
- Me? I'm fine, fine.

62
I'm glad you're here.

63
What's with your hair?

64
What?

65
What's different?

66
Nothing.

67
Oh, maybe that's it.

68
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's...

69
Okay, relax, relax.

70
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

71
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

72
Oh, God.

73
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

74
Oh.

75
Yeah, they were gross.

76
Oh, you know what I love?

77
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

78
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

79
Not just restaurants,
from our house.

80
Mrs. Geller?

81
ROSS:
She looks so small.

82
I know.

83
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

84
Goodbye, Nana.

85
Bye, Nana.

86
[ROSS YELLS]
[MONICA SCREAMS]

87
Ross!

88
Nurse.

89
What is going on?

90
You know, uh, how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

91
Well, she's not quite.

92
- What?
- She's not passed.

93
She's present. She's back.

94
What's going on?

95
She may have died.

96
"She may have died"?

97
We're looking into it.

98
Uh, I'll go see.

99
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]

100
This almost never happens.

101
[HEART MONITOR STOPS]

102
Now she's passed.

103
I just have to know, okay?

104
Is it my hair?

105
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

106
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

107
RACHEL: Hey.
MONICA: Hi.

108
RACHEL:
So did she?

109
Twice.

110
Oh, that sucks.

111
You guys okay?

112
I don't know. It's weird.

113
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel, uh...

114
Maybe that's because
she's not really gone.

115
No, no, she's gone.

116
We checked.

117
A lot.

118
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

119
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

120
...I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

121
Oh. And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high...

122
...got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

123
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe...

124
...whenever I use
one of those little yellow pencils.

125
I miss her.

126
Aw. Here, Pheebs.

127
Want this?

128
- Oh, thanks.
- Sure.

129
I just sharpened her this morning.

130
See, I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead...

131
...you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

132
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

133
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

134
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

135
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

136
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

137
I don't see why not.

138
ROSS:
Here's my retainer.

139
I was just thinking...

140
...when my time comes...
- Dad.

141
Listen to me.

142
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

143
You what?

144
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

145
Define "fun."

146
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...

147
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

148
Everyone thinks they know me.

149
Everyone says, "Jack Geller,
so predictable."

150
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
"Buried at sea? Huh."

151
That's probably what they'll say.

152
I'd like that.

153
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

154
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

155
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

156
Oh. Okay. Phew.

157
So, uh, what do you think it is about me?

158
I don't know what.

159
You just have...

160
...a quality.
- A quality. Right. Great.

161
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

162
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

163
What? He's cute.

164
Well, yeah.

165
He's no Brian in Payroll.

166
Is Brian?

167
No. I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up...

168
...I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

169
Well, I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

170
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

171
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

172
I'm really not.

173
ROSS:
This one?

174
No.

175
I've shown you every dress we have.

176
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...

177
...go with the burgundy.

178
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

179
You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

180
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

181
Wait. We need shoes.

182
Okay. Uh...

183
How about these?

184
That's really a day shoe.

185
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

186
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

187
Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

188
I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

189
No, it really should be burgundy.

190
- Unless we go with a different dress.
- Yes.

191
No, no, no. Watch this.

192
Wait, I may have something in the back.

193
Oh, my God.

194
Is everything all right, dear?

195
Yeah. Yeah.

196
Just Nana's stuff.

197
How we doing?
You guys ready?

198
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

199
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

200
Some days it's all I can think about.

201
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

202
Heh. You mean your earrings?

203
What did I say?

204
[RACHEL CLEARS THROAT]

205
- Are these the shoes?
- Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

206
What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?

207
Morning. We ready to go?

208
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

209
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

210
- It was a beautiful service.
- It really was.

211
Come here, sweetheart.

212
You know...

213
...I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

214
What?

215
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

216
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

217
You're watching football at a funeral?

218
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

219
You're a frightening, frightening man.

220
RACHEL:
Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.

221
Oh. I hope they're not ruined.

222
PHOEBE:
God, what a great day.

223
What? Weatherwise.

224
I know.

225
The air, the trees.

226
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost, uh, life...

227
- Ross, are you okay?
- Ross!

228
I'm fine. No, I'm fine.

229
Just...

230
...having my worst fear
realized, but...

231
PHOEBE: I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

232
- Huh.
- What? What is it?

233
- You missed a belt loop.
- Ugh.

234
[ROSS WHIMPERS]

235
Okay, it's in spasm.

236
Here, sweetie. Here.

237
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

238
Thanks, Mom.

239
ANDREA:
Sorry.

240
Hi, I'm Andrea.

241
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

242
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

243
PHOEBE:
Hey, look who's up.

244
- Hey.
- How do you feel?

245
[CHUCKLES]

246
I feel great.

247
[SLURRING]
I feel great. I feel great.

248
Wow, those pills really worked, huh?

249
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two, whew.

250
I love you guys.

251
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

252
I love Pheebs. Ha.

253
- That's so nice.
- Hey.

254
- Chandler.
- Hey.

255
I love you, man.

256
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay.

257
It doesn't matter to me.

258
You were right.

259
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

260
I love you the most.

261
Well, you know who I love the most?

262
- No.
- You.

263
Oh, you don't get it.

264
- Aw!
- What do you got there?

265
Uh, just a, uh, hearing disability.

266
What's the score?

267
17-14, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

268
Beautiful.

269
[SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO]

270
[RACHEL SIGHS]

271
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

272
Your grandmother would've hated this.

273
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

274
No, I'd be hearing about...

275
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham?

276
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say:

277
"Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead."

278
That sounds like Nana.

279
Do you know what it's like
to grow up...

280
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

281
I can imagine.

282
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out...

283
...to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

284
That is a wonder.

285
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again...

286
...I mean, if she was here right now...

287
...would you tell her?

288
Tell her what?

289
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

290
Like your hair, for example.

291
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

292
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

293
No.

294
I think some things are
better left unsaid.

295
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

296
Ha.

297
More wine, dear?

298
Oh, I think so.

299
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

300
Thank you.

301
They're yours.

302
Actually, they were Nana's.

303
MEN:
No!

304
Now I'm depressed.

305
Even more than I was.

306
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

307
Uh, that little naked guy would be me.

308
Aw. Look at the little thing.

309
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

310
Can we be grownups now?

311
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

312
- That's Nana right there in the middle.
- Wow.

313
Yeah, let's see.

314
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

315
Wow. Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

316
How old was she there?

317
Let's see. "1939."

318
Uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.

319
Huh. It looks like a fun gang.

320
Ooh, look, look, look.
I got Monica naked.

321
Let me see.

322
No, no. That would be me again.

323
I'm, uh, just trying something.

324
- Hey, Lowell.
- Oh, hey, Chandler.

325
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

326
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

327
How about you?

328
Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...

329
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but, uh...

330
...I'm not.

331
I know. That's what I told her.

332
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
So you can tell?

334
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

335
So you don't think I have...

336
...a quality?

337
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

338
By the way, your friend Brian
from Payroll? He is.

339
- He is?
- Yep.

340
And way out of your league.

341
Out of my league.

342
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

343
Hey, Brian.

Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long...

2
...but I was wondering,
do you think it would be possible...

3
...if I got a $100 advance on my salary?

4
An advance?

5
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving
with my family.

6
See, every year, we go skiing in Vail,
and normally my father pays for my ticket...

7
...but I've sort of started
this whole independent thing, you know...

8
...which is actually why I took this "job."

9
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.

10
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
Really, really awful.

12
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
Um...

14
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

15
I really do.

16
Does anybody need coffee?

17
MAN: Yeah, over here.
WOMAN: Yeah, I do.

18
Heh. Look at that.

19
Excuse me, sir?
Hi. You come in here all the time.

20
MAN: Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering...

21
...you think there's a possibility
you could give me an advance on my tips?

22
Huh? No.

23
RACHEL: Okay, okay. That's fine, fine.
Sorry about that spill before.

24

25
Only 98.50 to go.

26
- Hey. Hey.
ROSS & CHANDLER: Hey.

27
Ross, did you know that Mom and Dad
are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

28
What? No, they're not.

29
- Yes, they are. The Blymans invited them.
- You're wrong.

30
- I am not wrong.
- You're wrong.

31
No, I just talked to them.

32
I'm calling Mom.

33
- Hey, hey.
MONICA & CHANDLER: Hey.

34
- Hey.
- Coffee.

35
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?

36
Yes, I am.

37
As of today, I am officially
Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.

38
Thank you.

39
That's funny, I was thinking you look more
like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

40
What were you modeling for?

41
You know those posters
for the City Free Clinic?

42
Oh, wow. You're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

43
- Ah?
- The asthma guy's really cute.

44
- Oh, he is.
RACHEL: Isn't he?

45
- You know which one you're gonna be?
- No, no.

46
But I hear Lyme disease is open,
so, you know...

47
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

48
Thanks.

49
Well, you were right.
How can they do this to us, huh?

50
It's Thanksgiving.

51
Aw. Tell you what.
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

52
I'll make it just like Mom's.

53
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

54
You know they're not actually
supposed to...?

55
I'll work on the lumps.

56
- Joey, you're going home, right?
- Yeah.

57
And I assume, Chandler, you're still
boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays?

58
Yes, every single one of them.

59
Phoebe, you're gonna be
with your grandma?

60
Yeah, and her boyfriend.

61
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

62
So you're free Thursday, then?

63
- Yeah. Oh, can I come?
- Yeah.

64
Rach, you still thinking
you're gonna make it to Vail?

65
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

66
- Only $102 to go.
- I thought it was 98.50.

67
Yeah, well, it was, but I broke a cup.

68
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

69
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

70
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...

71
...and will probably wanna
bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

72
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]

73
Hi. Is Carol here?

74
- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
- Oh.

75
Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.

76
Well, not mine, but...

77
- Come in.
- Thanks.

78
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class,
and I have to get it back to the museum.

79
What's it look like?

80
Kind of like a big face without skin.

81
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.

82
- We can just look for it.
- Okay.

83
Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot
of books about being a lesbian.

84
Well, you know,
you have to take a course.

85
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

86
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.

87
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

88
[CHUCKLES]

89
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

90
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're...

91
...crazy?

92
What, you don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

93
You're not serious.
I mean, you really talk to it?

94
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

95
Do you, uh...? Do you talk about me?

96
- Yeah, yeah. All the time.
- Really?

97
But, um, we just refer to you as
"Bobo the sperm guy."

98
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly time too.

99
I mean, not that I believe any of this.

100
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.

101
- Really?
- I can show you.

102
This will seem a little weird.

103
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

104
...and then we'll all talk,
and you'll hear everything we say.

105
I'd just like to say
I'm totally behind this experiment.

106
In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head.

107
ROSS: Hey.
MONICA: Hey, Rach.

108
- Did you make your money?
RACHEL: No, not even close.

109
Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.

110
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

111
Uh, Rach...

112
...here's your mail.

113
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

114
Heh. No.

115
Here's your mail.

116
Thanks. You can just put it on the table.

117
Would you just open it?

118
Oh, my God.

119
- Oh, you guys are great.
- Aw. Ha, ha.

120
RACHEL: Aw.
- We all chipped in.

121
- We did?
- You owe me 20 bucks.

122
Thank you. Thank you so much.

123
Chandler, here you go.
Got your traditional holiday feast.

124
Got your tomato soup...

125
...your grilled-cheese fixings,
and your family-size bag of Funyuns.

126
Wait, this is what you're having
for Thanksgiving dinner?

127
What is it with you and this holiday?

128
[SIGHS]

129
All right, I'm 9 years old.

130
- Aw.
- Aw, I hate this story.

131
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.

132
I have... And I remember this part vividly.
- A mouthful of pumpkin pie.

133
And this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

134
Oh, my God.

135
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

136
Hi.

137
- We used to work together.
- We did?

138
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?

139
- Yes.
- I was the Aramis guy.

140
- Aramis? Aramis? Aramis?
- Oh.

141
Yeah, right.

142
I gotta tell you,
you're the best in the business.

143
- Get out.

144
You're amazing. You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.

145

or something?

- I just remembered I have to do something.

[ROSS CLEARS THROAT]

161
[CHANDLER CLEARS THROAT]

162
So I guess you all saw it.

163
- What?
- Saw what?

164
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.

165
[ALL LAUGHING]

166
Hey.

167
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

168
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.

169
MONICA:
Mm, looking good. Okay.

170
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking,
yams are yamming.

171
What?

172
I don't know.

173
It's just not the same
without Mom in the kitchen.

174
Ugh. All right, that's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me.

175
Well, that's closer. That's...

176
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.

177
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop.

178
Oh, you must stop shooping.

179
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

180
Chandler, will you just come in, already?

181
No, thank you. I prefer to keep
a safe distance from all this merriment.

182
Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie.

183
[MIMICS PLANE ZOOMING]

184
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.

185
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

186
That's not a question.

187
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.

188
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.

189
I mean, it's bad enough
I can't be with my family...

190
...because of my disease.

191
All right, fine.

192
Tonight's potatoes
will be both mashed with lumps...

193
...and in the form of Tots.

194
Yes.

195
All right,
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

196
- Ah.
- Okay, Mom never hit.

197
[MIXER WHIRRING]

198
PHOEBE:
Okay, all done.

199
What? Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?

200
Ross needs lumps.

201
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just...

202
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

203
Why would we do that?

204
Then they'd be just like
my mom used to make it...

205
...you know, before she died.

206
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.

207
Okay. Goodbye, you guys.

208
Thanks for everything.

209
Oh, God, look at... Sorry. I'm so sorry.

210
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has gotten away.

211
- The balloon?
- No, no, the actual cartoon character.

212
Of course the balloon.

213
It's all over the news.
Before he reached Macy's...

214
...he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park.

215
- I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
- Well, I can't. I gotta go.

216
An 80-foot inflatable dog
loose over the city?

217
- How often does that happen?
- Almost never.

218
- Got the keys?
- Okay.

219
Any time you're ready.

220
Okay.

221
Okay, here we go.

222
Oh...

223
Okay, where am I talking to here?
I mean, uh...

224
Well, there is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but...

225
Just aim for the bump.

226
Okay.

227
Okay, okay.

228
Okay, here goes.

229
You know, I... You know, I can't do this.

230
This is... It's too weird. I feel stupid.

231
All right, so don't do it. It's fine.

232
You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

233
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

234
- That moment when we first saw
the giant dog shadow fall over the park?

235
But did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.

236
Okay, right about now the turkey
should be crispy on the outside...

237
...and juicy on the inside.

238
Why are we standing here?

239
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You've got the keys.

240
No, I don't.

241
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."

242
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys?"

243
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys."

244
Either of you have the keys?

245
- The oven is on.
- Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.

246
- Wait. We have a copy of your key.
- Well, then get it, get it!

247
Hey, hey.
That tone won't make me go any faster.

248
- Joey.
- That one will.

249
ROSS:
And everyone's telling me:

250
"You gotta pick a major.
You gotta pick a major."

251
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

252
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

253
You're just happy
you don't have gills anymore.

254
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

255
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

256
- How's it going?
ROSS: Shh, shh, shh.

257
[SINGING]
Here we come

258
Walkin' down the street

259
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

260
Hey, hey...

261
- Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
- I did.

262
- Well, does it always, uh...?
- No, no, that was the first.

263
- Keep singing. Keep singing.
ROSS: Oh.

264
[SINGING]
Hey, hey, you're my baby

265
And I can't wait to meet you

266
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

267
[CAROL & SUSAN SHRIEK]

268
I felt it that time.

269
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

270
I'm the one without any breasts

271
- Nope, not that one.
- Can you go any faster with that?

272
Hey, I got one keyhole
and about a zillion keys.

273
You do the math.

274
Why do you guys have so many keys
in there anyway?

275
For an emergency just like this.

276
All right, listen, smirky.

277
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon...

278
...I would be on a plane,
watching a woman do this right now.

279
But I'm not.

280
I swear you said you had the keys.

281
No. I wouldn't say I had the keys
unless I had the keys.

282
And I obviously did not have the keys.

283
Okay, all right, that's it.
Enough with the keys. No one say "keys."

284
Why would I have the keys?

285
Aside from the fact
that you said you did?

286
- But I didn't.
- Well, you should have.

287
MONICA: Why?
RACHEL: Because.

288
Why? Because everything
is my responsibility?

289
Isn't it enough
that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?

290
Everyone wants a different kind of potato,
so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.

291
You know, does anybody care
what kind of potatoes I want?

292
No, no, no!

293
You know, just as long as Phoebe
gets her peas and onions...

294
...and Mario gets his Tots.

295
[SOBBING IN HIGH VOICE]
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...

296
It's all burnt, and I can't...

297
[SOBS]

298
Okay, Monica,
only dogs can hear you now, so...

299
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

300
Oh, God.

301
- Ooh.
- Oh.

302
Well, the turkey's burnt.

303
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.

304
[SINGING]
Here we come

305
Walkin' down the...

306
[ROSS HUMS]

307
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

308
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?

309
Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.

310
Oh, God, this is great.

311
The plane is gone,
so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

312
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.

313
Oh, really?

314
So why was I busting my ass...

315
...to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?!

316
- You call that delicious?
- You be quiet!

317
[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]

318
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

319
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

320
PHOEBE: Ew.
- What?

321
PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's
taking his turkey out of the oven.

322
JOEY, ROSS & MONICA:
Eh.

323
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God. He's not alone.

324
Ugly Naked Guy...

325
...is having Thanksgiving dinner
with Ugly Naked Gal.

326
JOEY:
I gotta see this.

327
ALL:
Aw.

328
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.

329
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.

330
It's nice that he has someone.

331
Shall I carve?

332
By all means.

333
CHANDLER:
All right.

334
Okay, who wants light cheese
and who wants dark cheese?

335
I don't even wanna know
about the dark cheese.

336
- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
- Ooh, I will.

337
Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

338
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

339
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

340
The bigger half.

341
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

342
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
ALL: Mm.

343
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

344
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

345
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

346
...or projectile vomiting.

347
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

348
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

349
...syphilis and stuff...

350
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

351
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

352
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

353
RACHEL & JOEY:
That's so sweet.

354
RACHEL:
Thank you.

355
ROSS:
Mm.

356
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

357
And a crappy New Year.

358
ALL:
Hear, hear.

1
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

2
Oh, my God.

3
Oh, my... Excuse me. Move, move,
move! Emergency, please!

4
Excuse me, excuse me.

5
- Rach!
- Ah!

6
There you are!

7
Hey!
- Hi!

8
Oh! So, so.

9
How was China? You!

10
It was... It was great.
Oh, what happened?

11
- What? I am?
- You're bleeding.

12
- God.
- Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.

13
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

14
Come on, I wanna hear everything.
Everything!

15
Well, uh, where do I start? Um...

16
This is Julie.
Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.

17
Hi. Heh.

18
Uh, oh! These are...

19
- These are... Aren't for you.
- Oh.

20
Heh. Uh, these are for you.

21
Welcome to our country.

22
Thank you. I'm from New York.

23
Well, not a problem.
We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

24
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?

25
- Okay.
- Okay.

26
- No way.
- I'm telling you, she went to the airport.

27
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.

28
Oh, my God. This is huge. This...

29
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

30
All right, what's bigger than huge?

31
- Um, this?
- Yes.

32
Guys, you got new haircuts!

33
Yes, yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

34
Because, you know:

35
"If you don't
look good, we don't look good. "

36
I love that voice! Ha, ha.

37
- You guys!
- Oh, oh.

38
Airport. Airport. Ross.

39
Not... Not alone.

40
Julie. Arm around her!

41
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

42
Okay, I think she's trying
to tell us something.

43
Quick, get the verbs.

44
- Ow.
- You! You!

45
You said he liked me!

46
You! You...!

47
You slowpokes!

48
That's all right, Rach.
We got the bags. Uh...

49
Hi. Hello.

50
Julie, this is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.

51
- Hey.
- Phoebe, hi. Mwah.

52
- Joey, what up?
- Hey.

53
- Everyone, this is Julie.
- Julie.

54
Oh.

55
Hi!

56
Hi! But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

57
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

58
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

59
- With the screaming guy...
- And the spitting.

60
You gotta hear this story.

61
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

62
Two hundred, at least.

63
- And this guy...
- And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!

64
Oh, I'm so sorry.

65
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

66
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...

67
...and it is all I can think about.

68
This is amazing. I mean, how...?

69
- How did this happen?
- Ross and I were in grad school together.

70
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

71
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
- Julie!

72
Julie. Isn't that great?

73
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

74
It's an expression.

75
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

76
- Then we're gonna go see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

77
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

78
Well don't tell us
what's gonna happen, though

79
Because I like to be surprised.

80
Bye!
Bye.

81
- Rach. Can I get some coffee? Thank you.
- Sure.

82
- Hey, Rach...
- Did you talk to him yet?

83
- No.
- Then, no.

84
So, what the hell happened
to you in China?

85
I mean, when last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

86
I know. I know I was.

87
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

88
"It's never gonna happen. Move on. "
You know whose voice that was?

89
God?

90
It was you, pal.

91
Well, maybe it was God doing me.

92
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

93
And then I met Julie, and...

94
I don't know. We're having a great time.

95
I never would have gone for it with her,
if it hadn't been for you.

96
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

97
- Here's your lemonade.
- I didn't order lemonade.

98
Oh. Well then you better go
take that back.

99
They're gonna charge you for that.

100
- But...
- Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

101
Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?

102
He said...

103
He said they're having a great time.

104
- I'm sorry.
- What?

105
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

106
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

107
...without any outside help whatsoever.

108
How is that a silver lining?

109
You have to really wanna see it.

110
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

111
Hey, Pheebs.

112
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Oh, okay.

113
How...

114
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

115
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

116
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

117
So, what were you thinking?

118
I was thinking
you gave the guys great haircuts.

119
I thought you'd like to do mine.

120
Oh! No.

121
- Why not?
- Because I'm just...

122
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

123
No, you're not.

124
I know I'm not, but you are.

125
I was trying to spare your feelings.

126
Hello? Oh, hi.

127
Yeah, hold on a second.
Ross, Julie for you.

128
Hello? Hi.

129
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

130
- You need clothes altered?
- No, no.

131
I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

132
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

133
He did my first suit when I was 15.

134
No, wait, 16.

135
No, excuse me, heh, 15.

136
All right, when was 1990?

137
Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

138
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

139
Okay, bye. What?

140
Oh, that is so sweet.

141
No... Ha, ha.

142
No. Okay. No, you hang up.

143
No, you... Okay.

144
Okay. One, two, three.

145
Shh.

146
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.

147
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

148
You. You. Yo...

149
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

150
- Rachel. Heh.
- Sorry.

151
- I'll just call her back.
- Okay.

152
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

153
No, you hang up.

154
Okay, okay, okay.
How did this happen to me? How?

155
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

156
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

157
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

158
...ugh, this really great guy
that I can't have.

159
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

160
I know you did.

161
Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it.
I'm just gonna deal with it

162
I gotta get out of here!

163
I don't care what you guys say.
Something's bothering her.

164
You know, I think I was 16.

165
Please, just a little bit off the back.

166
Um, I'm still on "no. "

167
- Uh, morning.
- Hey.

168
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

169
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for that again.

170
- What's going on?
- I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

171
What stupid thing did you do?

172
Ew!

173
Why don't you just go get dressed...

174
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

175
Rachel, how did this happen?

176
I don't know,
I kind of ran into him last night.

177
- Where?
- At his apartment.

178
Is this juice?

179
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

180
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

181
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

182
Yeah. People do stupid things
when they're upset.

183
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't...

184
But this is about your horrible mistake.

185
- Hi.
Hey!

186
- Hi...
Sorry we're late.

187
We were, uh...

188
Well, there was touching.

189
- Hey...!
- Oh.

190
- Hey, Ross!
- Paolo. Ha.

191
What a...

192
What, uh...?
What are you doing here?

193
- I do Raquel.
- Ah.

194
So, uh, he's back?

195
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

196
No, not a problem.

197
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

198
Okay, you're gonna
have to not touch my ass.

199
Well, despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

200
...I've got pants that need to be altered.

201
Oh, when you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

202
He'll know what it means.

203
You sure he's gonna be able
to crack that code?

204
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here,
my hair was so much shorter and cuter.

205
All right. Okay.

206
But... But! You have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

207
...and all, you know, Monica about it.

208
I promise.

209
All right, let's see.

210
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

211
But I promise,
none of you will feel a thing.

212
Okay.

213
- All right, that's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

214
Yeah, but this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

215
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

216
...doesn't trust a person.

217
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.

218
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

219
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

220
This is how he wears it.

221
- How who wears it?
- Demi Moore.

222
Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.

223
Well, he was a he
in Arthur and in 10.

224
That's Dudley Moore!

225
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

226
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh, my God!

227
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

228
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

229
Which one is Demi Moore?

230
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

231
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

232
- I know!
- Oh, my God!

233
How long do you want the cuffs?

234
At least as long as I have the pants.

235
I just got that.

236
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.

237
How is she?

238
It's too soon to tell.

239
She's resting, which is a good sign.

240
- How's the hair?
- I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.

241
It doesn't look good.

242
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

243
Can we see her?

244
Your hair looks too good.
It would upset her.

245
Ross, why don't you come on in.

246
- Well, how you doing?
- I'm okay.

247
- Ooh, that bad, huh?
- What?

248
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

249
It's one of my gifts. Sit.

250
Ugh.

251
Ugh, Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

252
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.

253
But today, it's like there's rock bottom...

254
...50 feet of crap...

255
...then me.

256
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.

257
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

258
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

259
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

260
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Look, Rach, Rach.

261
I've been with my share of women.

262
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

263
But the point is...

264
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

265
Really?

266
Yo, paisan.

267
Can I talk to you for a sec?

268
Your tailor...

269
...is a very bad man!

270
- Frankie? What are you talking about?
- Hey, what's going on?

271
Joey's tailor...

272
...took advantage of me.

273
- What?
- No way.

274
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.

275
Oh, come on.
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

276
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

277
What?

278
Cupping.

279
That's how they do pants!

280
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

281
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

282
What? Ross, tell him.
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

283
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

284
What's the matter with you?

285
What?

286
That's not?

287
Oh, my God.

288
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

289
I like it.

290
Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!

291
Thank you. My hair is very amused.

292
Oh, come on, things could be worse.
I mean, uh...

293
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

294
I know it's crazy, but it's true. "

295
Thank you.

296
- Well, I gotta go. Bye.
- See you.

297
Bye, Rach!

298
Wait, are you leaving?

299
That's what I meant by "bye. "

300
Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

301
Okay.

302
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

303
That's okay.

304
- What's going on?
- Um...

305
- Well, um, okay, first of all...
- Mm-hm.

306
...Paolo and I are not back together.

307
That was a stupid thing I did.

308
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

309
...well, I wouldn't.

310
- Ahem.
- Um...

311
- Heh.
- Second of all...

312
What?

313
Before I say anything...

314
...is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy.

315
Then I tell you what I think...

316
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

317
...and I look like a complete idiot?
- No, no, no.

318
Okay. Um, well, then,
I think the guy's scum.

319
I hate him. I mean, I actually...
I physically hate him.

320
You know? I always have.

321
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

322
- Really?
- Rach?

323
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

324
...and who gets how funny...

325
...and sweet and amazing...

326
...and adorable and sexy you are.

327
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

328
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.

329
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

330
Like the way I do with Julie.

331
Was there a "second of all"?

332
Um...

333
No, um, I think that was the whole "all. "

334
I gotta go. Okay?

335
- Okay.
- Thanks.

336
Okay.

337
No, I swear to God, Dad!

338
That's not how they measure pants!

339
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

340
- Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that.
- Really?

341
- Yeah. You wanna do it now?
- Great!

342
- Okay.
- Okay.

343
See you.

344
Okay, I just wanna make
really sure this time.

345
Uh-huh. Ahem.

346
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

347
No.

348
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's Roddy McDowall.

349
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

350
- Oh! Yeah, okay.
- Yeah. Okay?

351
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1
Joey, would you slow down?

2
They're not gonna be sold out of papers
at 1:00 in the morning.

3
I'm excited.
I've never gotten reviewed before.

4
You were so amazing as the king.
I'm really impressed. I was.

5
But you know what?

6
You might wanna consider
wearing underwear next time.

7
Because when you sat on your throne,
you could kind of see your...

8
...royal subjects.

9
Here it is. Here it is.

10
"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

11
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king. "

12
Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

13
- All right? Pheebs, read yours.
- Okay.

14
"The only thing worse than the mindless,
adolescent direction... "

15
Does anybody have one
from a different paper?

16
Ross, read yours.

17
I don't want to.

18
Joey, honey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

19
Maybe they do.

20
I've been doing this 10 years
and I haven't gotten anywhere.

21
There's gotta be a reason.

22
Come on, man, you're just, uh,
paying your dues.

23
No, no, no. It's too hard.

24
It's not worth it. I quit.

25
What?
That's crazy.

26
Wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute.

27
I believe this will change your mind.

28
"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was
able to achieve brilliant new levels of... "

29
Continued on page 153.

30
"... sucking. "

31
When I was little,
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

32
But then I found out you have to
put your hands into cows and stuff.

33
Hi.

34
Are you okay?

35
Yeah, just a tough day at work,
you know?

36
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

37
I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket.

38
Where is he? What? He's here, isn't he?

39
- Maybe.
- Don't toy with me.

40
- Geller!
- Hey, Fun Bobby.

41
Whoa, hey. You been working out?

42
Not at all.

43
I love this guy.

44
I was so psyched to hear
you're back with my sister.

45
- You and me both.
- So, what'd I miss? Come on.

46
Oh. We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

47
- Hey, do you need me to pick you up?
- No, I'm all right, man, really.

48
No, I'm picking you up.

49
Hey, no, seriously.
I don't need you to...

50
- All right, it still works.
- Okay.

51
Now, before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

52
I'm still gonna go.

53
- Okay, I'll see you later, babe.
Ah.

54
Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

55
Mm.

56
- See you.
Bye.

57
Fun Bobby is so great.

58
Oh, isn't he?

59
I really think this time it may work with him.
I mean, he makes me feel so good.

60
And I've been feeling so lousy,
you know, no job, no boyfriend.

61
Well, at least my cup is half full.

62
Half full of love.

63
And for our two-week anniversary,
he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin.

64
Cabin of love.

65
We went through a lot of wine tonight,
you guys.

66
- Really? I only had two glasses.
- I just had a glass.

67
- Two.
- I had one glass.

68
I had about a mug full in this lovely...

69
..."I got boned at the Museum
of Natural History" mug.

70
Okay, so that's, what? Two bottles.

71
And yet somehow we went through five?

72
Whoa.

73
Oh.

74
So what? So he drank a lot tonight.

75
Yeah, but, you know,
now that I think about it...

76
...I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby
without a drink in his hand.

77
Yeah. Ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?

78
Did you notice how he always
starts his stories with, um:

79
"Okay, I was so wasted," or,
"Oh, we were so bombed. "

80
Or, um, "So I wake up and I'm
in this Dumpster in Connecticut. "

81
Monica, have you ever been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

82
Well, we just happen to go to
a lot of places where you might drink.

83
I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

84
Or to a club, or to the...

85
...zoo.

86
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

87
Um, I don't know, why don't you taste it?

88
Mm. No.

89
Oh, well, too late, you already had some.

90
What do you say we make these, uh,
coffees Irish?

91
Um, cake.

92
Yeah, we're gonna...
We're gonna get some cake.

93
You know, it seems like you've been
making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.

94
I would make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

95
Bobby.

96
Yeah, okay.

97
Look, maybe this is none of my business,
or maybe it is, I don't know.

98
But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.

99
Okay, look, this isn't the first time
somebody said something to me about this.

100
But, I don't know, I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker. "

101
Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day. "

102
So, what are you saying now?

103
I guess I'm saying...

104
...I'll try and quit.

105
I kind of like that you worry about me.

106
So, what's going on?

107
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

108
Oh. Why?

109
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
Hey.
Hey.

111
Guess who's back in show business.

112
Ooh, ooh. Lorne Greene?

113
No, Pheebs. You know why?
Because he's dead.

114
Oh, no.

115
Okay, I guess this is gonna seem
bittersweet now...

116
...but Joey, that's who.

117
Oh, yay!
Really?

118
My agent just called me with an audition
for Days of our Lives.

119
Kick ass.

120
We have to celebrate.
We should do a soap opera theme.

121
Hey, yeah. We could all sleep together,
and then one of us could get amnesia.

122
Rach, what time do you get off?
We're all gonna do something tonight.

123
Uh, well, actually, I'm already done.
Ahem. But I kind of got plans.

124
You have other friends?

125
Yeah, I, uh... I have a date.

126
- What?
- With a man?

127
What? What is so strange
about me having a date?

128
What about Ross?

129
Are you still mad at him
because he made that list about...?

130
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

131
I'm not really anything at him anymore.

132
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

133
Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.

134
But you guys came so close.

135
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, you guys.
You're gonna have to get used to the fact...

136
...that I will not be dating Ross.

137
Here he is. Hi.

138
Guys, this is Russ.

139
Hi.

140
No, no, no. I'm not saying
you're not talented. You're very talented.

141
It's just that with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

142
Oh, honey, give me a break, will you?
Oh, oh. I'll talk to you later.

143
Well, there's my favorite client.

144
So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

145
Well, I think it went pretty well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

146
Joey. Have you ever seen me ecstatic?

147
- No.
- Well, here it is.

148
Okay. Uh, listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

149
- The network casting lady...
- Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

150
Yeah, yeah, she's great.

151
But I kind of got the feeling
that she was sort of coming on to me.

152
And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know...

153
- If I would have sent the little general in.
- Oh.

154
I see. Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

155
...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

156
Yeah, hi. Lori, please.

157
Hi, darling.

158
So how about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

159
Isn't he terrific?

160
Uh-huh.

161
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

162
Yeah, you're gonna have to
sleep with her.

163
What's the matter?
Fun Bobby.

164
What? Isn't he sober?

165
Oh, he's sober all right.

166
Just turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

167
Ah. Okay.

168
All right, here you go, sweetie.

169
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

170
Oh, God, yes.

171
There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

172
That is funny.

173
I needed to buy a hammer
the other night...

174
...and I'm out walking
around the neighborhood.

175
But apparently...

176
...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

177
Uh, say, honey, don't you have to
be at your interview?

178
Oh, yeah.

179
See you guys.
Bye...

180
...ridiculously dull Bobby.

181
- Oh, my God.
- He's not that bad.

182
Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

183
Okay, okay, don't get all squinky.

184
Maybe it was just the kind of story
where you had to be there.

185
But I'm gonna be there.

186
For the rest of my life.

187
I can't break up with him.
I made him quit drinking.

188
- He's dull because of me.
- All right, don't say that.

189
He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

190
...set it free.

191
- Hi.
- Hey, Ross. Ah.

192
Hi, Russ.

193
I've just got two more tables to clean,
and then we'll go, okay?

194
Okay. I'll just sit here and, uh...

195
...chat with your, uh...

196
...friend-type people.

197
Rachel? Um, hi.

198
- Hi.
- Okay.

199
So you know what you're doing, right?

200
Ha, ha. Waitressing?

201
Well, yeah. But, no. I mean, um...

202
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

203
- Huh. Bob Saget?
- Oh, yeah.

204
- No, no, no. Oh, oh.
- Hi.

205
Oh, my, oh.

206
What...? What's wrong?

207
- I... Okay.
- She's just upset because she, uh...

208
She buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

209
Mm-hm.

210
All right.

211
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

212
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

213
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?

215
Yes. Yes, I am.

216
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?

217
Actually, I'm, uh, kind of a...

218
...you know...

219
...a date-type thing...

220
...of Rachel's.

221
- A date?
- Yeah. I'm her date.

222
Oh. Oh, you're, uh...

223
Oh, you're the date.

224
You know, this is actually good...

225
...because if we ever lose Ross,
we have a spare.

226
Oh. You are the, uh, paleontologist.

227
Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a...

228
Periodontist.

229
See? Now they're
as different as night and...

230
...later that night.

231
Well, I am going to, uh, get a beverage.
Heh.

232
- Uh, it was nice, uh, meeting you.
- Ditto.

233
I, uh... Well, I met Russ.

234
Oh.

235
Hey, I didn't know
we were, uh, seeing other people.

236
- Well, we're not seeing each other, so...
- Huh.

237
Well, uh, for your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

238
...who's curator of moths and other, uh...

239
...winged things...

240
...who's, uh, let it be known
that she is drawn to me, much like a...

241
...you know. Ahem.

242
Well, so far I've been keeping her at bay,
but, uh, if this is the deal...

243
Yeah, this is the deal.

244
- Okay, well, um, have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

245
- Russ, are you ready?
- Yeah.

246
Bye.
Bye.

247
She's dating?

248
Yes. Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

249
What do you mean?

250
- Do you not see it?
- See what?

251
I don't know what she sees
in that goober.

252
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know, uh...

253
...hello, a week to get out a sentence?

254
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

255
Yeah.

256
- Hey.
Hey.

257
Whoa, whoa.

258
I'm guessing you didn't get the part...

259
...or, uh, Italy called
and said it was hungry?

260
Well, the part's mine if I want it.

261
Oh, my God.

262
Yeah. If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

263
Oh, my...

264
...God?

265
Ten years I've been waiting for
a break like this, Chandler. Ten years.

266
I mean, Days of our Lives.
That's actually on television.

267
So, what are you gonna do?

268
I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean...

269
How can I do that?

270
Well, I've got a pop-up book
that told me everything I needed to know.

271
I've never slept with someone for a part.

272
Well, is she...?

273
Sorry.

274
- Is she good-looking?
- Yeah.

275
She's totally good-looking.
I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...

276
...I'd be buying her breakfast.

277
You know, after having slept with her.

278
You know, maybe this isn't
such a big deal.

279
I mean, the way that I see it is, you get
a great job and you get to have sex.

280
You know? Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas.

281
I just... I just don't think
that I want it that way though, you know?

282
I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?

283
I'm always gonna look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent...

284
...or because of, you know,
the little general.

285
Didn't you used to call it the little major?

286
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

287
Can I get you something from the bar?

288
Yes, I would like something.

289
No. No, thank you.

290
No, if you want a drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

291
No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

292
Just some water, please.

293
- So the light went out in my refrigerator.
- Scotch on the rocks with a twist.

294
I'm sorry.

295
Hey, we're having some fun now,
huh, Ross?

296
Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

297
Okay. Eleven letters...

298
...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium. "

299
- Dysprosium.
- Ha, ha. Dysprosium.

300
Try mendelevium.

301
And weenie number two has it.

302
Unless of course 9 Down, "Nights in White
Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.

303
You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

304
- What?
- Okay, honey, you're dating Ross.

305
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

306
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

307
Steve, sleeve.

308
Okay, no one is named sleeve.

309
Phoebe, what the hell
are we talking about?

310
Other than their names being similar,
I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.

311
For your information,
it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

312
You could not be more wrong.

313
You could try,
but you would not be successful.

314
Okay, I'm gonna get some more coffee
before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

315
- I know what your problem is.
- Oh, you do, do you?

316
Mm-hm. You're jealous.

317
Uh, of what?

318
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

319
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

320
That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

321
It's like, day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

322
- Now, you listen...
- No, no.

323
Let me finish.
No, let me finish.

324
No, you let me fin...

325
- Hi.
- Hi.

326
Ew.

327
Ew, ew, ew.

328
- Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
No.

329
I don't even think he knew.

330
Hey, would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

331
I don't know.
Who would I have to sleep with?

332
Me.

333
Why would I have to sleep with you?

334
It's my game. You want the job or not?

335
- Hi.
- Hey.

336
- Good morning.
- Where you going?

337
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

338
Oh.

339
What's with all the bottles of liquor?

340
What's going on?
Is, uh, Bobby drinking again?

341
Oh, no, this is not for him.
This is for me.

342
That way, he's still sober, but I find
his stories about shoelaces more amusing.

343
Ugh, God. Even his knock is boring.

344
- Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
- Uh, could I talk to you a minute?

345
Sure.

346
- This is really hard for me to say.
- Oh, God. You fell off the wagon.

347
Oh, no, no.

348
It's about you.

349
What about me?

350
I think you may have a drinking problem.

351
What, these?

352
No, these are, um, for cuts and scrapes.

353
Look, I am just not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship right now.

354
Oh, shoot.

355
Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

356
Okay.

357
Take care.

358
- Okay. You too.
- Bye.

359
What happened?

360
Well, we kind of broke up.

361
Aw.

362
Does anybody want these?

363
I'll take one.

364
Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

365
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd the callback go?

366
Ugh, it was unbelievable.
I walked in there and she was all over me.

367
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I couldn't do it.

368
- I told her I didn't want the part that way.
- Good for you.

369
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
But then after I left her office...

370
...she caught up with me at the elevator
and offered me an even bigger part.

371
So, and?

372
So you are now looking
at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

373
...recurring in at least four episodes.

374
All right!

375
All right, I gotta go shower.

376
Hi.

377
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

378
I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

379
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

380
All she said was that I remind her
too much of somebody.

381
You have any idea who
she's talking about?

382
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

383
- She hates him.
Oh.

384
- Hey.
Hey, Julie.

385
Hey, how are you doing?

386
Oh. I don't know. I mean,
it's definitely weird not being with Ross...

387
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

388
Actually, I've got some of his stuff
that he, um...

1
Okay, here's his diaper bag...

2
...and his, uh, Mr. Winky. Ha, ha.
Ha, ha.

3
And, uh...

4
Oh.

5
Him. Hi!

6
- How did everything go?
Great.

7
There was a projectile, uh...

8
...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

9
- Ha, ha. We've gotta go.
- Okay.

10
Oh, right. Um...

11
I've got some news. It's about us.

12
- Oh, you and me?
- Uh, no. Susan and me.

13
The other "us. "

14
Okay.

15
We're getting married.

16
As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

17
We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

18
Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

19
I just thought that...

20
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

21
...if I couldn't, uh, revel in your joy?

22
And I'm reveling, baby. Believe me.

23
Is your finger caught in that chair?

24
Mm-hm.

25
- Want us to go?
- Uh-huh.

26
You're clearly
bothered by something. Tell me what it is.

27
This is cool.
You're actually on television.

28
I know.
It really hit me last night.

29
I'm on Days of our Lives.

30
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

31
- Yes!
- What?

32
Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

33
...and she's in a full-body cast.

34
Yes!

35
They asked me, which is cool
since I've never catered...

36
...and I need the money.
Is this a problem?

37
- Would it matter?
- You're so great!

38
Thank you!

39
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not.

40
They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

41
They love each other.

42
They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

43
If you wanna call that a reason.

44
Who's the bitterest man
In the living room?

45
The bitterest man
In the living room?

46
Hi, neighbor.

47
- I thought you were over this.
- That has nothing to do with it.

48
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

49
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

50
Did I miss it?

51
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

52
Whoa, she's pretty.

53
And she's really nice.

54
She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

55
...and smell-the-fart acting.

56
I'm sorry, what?
Excuse me?

57
You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

58
...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

59
So while you're thinking...

60
...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

61
Like this:

62
Oh.
Okay.

63
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

64
- Mrs. Wallace?
- Yes.

65
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

66
Is she going to be all right?

67
I'm afraid the situation
is much more dire than we'd expected.

68
Your sister's suffering from a...

69
...subcranial hematoma.

70
Perhaps we can
discuss this further over coffee.

71
Nice!

72
For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

73
Do it again!
All right!

74
That was so good!
Do it again.

75
"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

76
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

77
No, that's me.

78
Oh, right.

79
Oh.
Oh.

80
Oh, thanks. Couldn't, uh...

81
Is everything okay?

82
Um, no. Uh-uh. Um...

83
One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

84
Oh, my God.

85
That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

86
Yeah, uh-huh.

87
Um, she was, you know,
82 years old...

88
...and her name was, um,
Mrs. Adelman.

89
Oh, honey.

90
It's just so strange. You know...

91
...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

92
...I'll have some breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

93
Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it. "

94
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

95
...I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

96
And when her spirit
left her body...

97
...I don't think it went very far.

98
What do you mean?

99
I think it went into me.

100
This is so hard.

101
I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

102
Well, lambs are scarier.

103
Or the movie would've been called
Silence of the Ducks.

104
Okay, who ordered what?

105
I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

106
And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

107
Oh, God.

108
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

109
I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

110
...I didn't marry Barry
my life is crap.

111
Talk about crap,
just listen to Stella Neidman...

112
...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

113
Uh, Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

114
I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

115
Sit up!

116
There she is!

117
- Mom!
Hey, sweetie!

118
So this is where you work!

119
Oh, it's wonderful!

120
Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

121
I guess that's the fun.

122
Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

123
Monica! You look gorgeous!

124
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

125
Uh, this is Joey.

126
This is Phoebe.

127
This is Chandler.

128
You remember Ross?

129
- Oh, hello, Ross.
- Hi, Mrs. Green.

130
What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

131
...with the big job!

132
Oh, Mom!

133
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

134
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

135
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

136
I went from my father's house
to the sorority house...

137
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

138
Really?

139
I know who you remind me of.

140
Evelyn Durmer.

141
That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

142
Pheebs? Ha, ha. Who's Evelyn Durmer?

143
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?

144
Oh, my God!

145
There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

146
Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

147
You have some life here, sweetie!

148
Mom, I realize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

149
...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

150
This is just
so much better for me.

151
I know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

152
And I've never seen you this happy.

153
I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want. "

154
For me.

155
Well, not just for you.

156
What do you mean?

157
I'm, uh, considering leaving your father.

158
All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

159
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.

160
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.

161
What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

162
- You had no idea?
- None.

163
They didn't fight?

164
No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

165
How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

166
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

167
Hey, look who's up!

168
I just can't believe this is happening.

169
When I was little,
all parents got divorced.

170
I figured as an adult,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

171
Can't you look at this as flattering?

172
She just wants to be like you.

173
Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

174
When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

175
...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

176
But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

177
Oh, that's him.

178
Damn. My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

179
- Phoebe?
- Hi, Mr. Adelman.

180
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

181
That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

182
Um, do you wanna sit?

183
No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

184
What can I do for you, my dear?

185
Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but, um...

186
...I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

187
...it, um, kind of stuck around...

188
...in me.

189
You're saying my wife is in you?

190
Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

191
...um, can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

192
Any reason to hang around?

193
I don't know what to say.

194
All I can think of is that...

195
...she used to say that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

196
- Everything?
- Everything.

197
Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.

198
Oh, wait, I...

199
I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

200
I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

201
Worth a shot, huh?

202
Ha, ha. Look at this.

203
These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

204
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

205
He came straight from the office?

206
Oh, no. That was his costume.

207
See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

208
Um, you guys?

209
Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

210
Actually, I think you said:

211
"Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen. "

212
Really? Weird. Anyway...

213
I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

214
I just didn't plan enough time to do it.

215
- You want some help?
- If you want.

216
- Hey.
Hey.

217
What a day.

218
I took her everywhere.

219
The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

220
...the Statue of Liberty.

221
She's still with you?

222
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

223
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

224
Such a pretty face!

225
Oh, this is so much fun.
Just the girls.

226
Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

227
God!

228
Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

229
Well, that's fine.

230
I never did it. I just thought I might.

231
What's new in sex?

232
The only man I've been with
is your father.

233
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

234
This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

235
...there might be more.

236
You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

237
All right.

238
You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

239
Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

240
Then what do you want?

241
I guess I figured
you would understand.

242
Why on earth
would I understand this?

243
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

244
But I married mine.

245
Oh.

246
We're in trouble. We've only got
12 hours and 36 minutes left.

247
Move, move, move!

248
I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

249
Joey, speed it up!

250
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

251
How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

252
Do you want me to cry?

253
Is that what you want?

254
Do you wanna see me cry?

255
Sir, no, sir!

256
All right, you!

257
No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

258
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

259
But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

260
...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross. "

261
All right, ball a melon!

262
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

263
- How's it going?
- Great! Right on schedule.

264
Got my happy helpers.

265
That's fine. Whatever.

266
What's wrong?

267
Nothing.

268
Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

269
You're still gonna pay me, right?

270
Or something a little less selfish.

271
What's the matter? What happened?

272
My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

273
I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

274
...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

275
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

276
She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us. "

277
And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

278
I don't know what to do.

279
I, uh, can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

280
You do?

281
Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

282
Of course I do.

283
Well then, that's it.

284
If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

285
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

286
...no way that would've stopped me.

287
Look, this is your wedding.

288
Do it.

289
You're right. Of course you're right.

290
So we're back on?

291
We're back on.

292
You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

293
Can't believe I lost two minutes.

294
It just seems so futile.

295
You know?
All these women, and nothing!

296
I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

297
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

298
Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

299
The world is my lesbian wedding.

300
Butterscotch?

301
No one?

302
All right, you'll be sorry later.

303
Aw.

304
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

305
Ross.

306
Nothing makes God happier...

307
...than when two people, any two people,
come together in love.

308
Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

309
...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

310
Oh, my God.

311
Now I've seen everything!

312
Whoa, she's gone.

313
She's gone.

314
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!

315
Strangers in the night
Exchanging glances

316
Wondering in the night

317
Would you look at them?

318
Yeah. Can't help but.

319
How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

320
I wrapped those bad boys.

321
- I miss Rose.
- Oh, yeah?

322
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my life...

323
I don't know, I feel alone.

324
You know, I, uh, couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

325
I think it's time you forget about Rose,
move on with your life.

326
How about we get you a drink?

327
Okay. So nice!

328
I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

329
Hey, Mom, having fun?

330
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

331
And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

332
I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

333
...but it's nice to know I have options.

334
Ahem, there's more alcohol, right?

335
How you doing?

336
Okay.

337
You did a good thing today.

338
You wanna dance?

339
No, that's fine.

340
Come on.

341
I'll let you lead.

342
Okay.

343
Look, penis, schmenis!

344
Okay? We're all people.

345
Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

346
Mon, I was married.

347
- Yeah, me too, technically.
- I had a wedding.

348
Just trying to start a discussion.

349
Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

350
Isn't Ben in this?

351
- Of course!
- Absolutely.

1
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
Then put it in your mouth...

3
...with Monkeyshine Beer!

4
Wow.

5
Monkeyshine Beer.

6
Because it's a jungle out there!

7
That commercial always
makes me so sad.

8
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

9
...so everything works out okay.

10
I meant because the monkey in it
reminds me of Marcel.

11
I can see that.

12
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

13
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

14
I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

15
Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

16
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will
no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

17
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

18
...and when you got it back,
there'd be little monkey raisins in it?

19
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat...

20
All of a sudden, I had
this big "attitude problem. "

21
Hey. Hey.

22
- Check it out! Guess what I got?
- Rhythm?

23
No. My first fan mail!

24
Check it out.

25
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

26
Know that I love you and
would do anything to have you. "

27
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford. "

28
Oh, wait.

29
"P.S. Enclosed, please find
14 of my eyelashes. "

30
You know, in Crazy World,
that means you're married.

31
It's not addressed to Days Of Our Lives.
This came to your apartment.

32
There's no stamp on it.
This woman was in our building.

33
Oh, my God.

34
I got my very own stalker!

35
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

36
Hey.
Ooh.

37
Where are you off to?

38
There's this paleontology
conference in L.A.

39
So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

40
I think he will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

41
...and, uh, you know,
isn't capable of that emotion.

42
Oh, Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

43
Oh? Oh.

44
Okay, so everyone, ahem...

45
...pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

46
So everyone just laugh. Now!

47
I know, I know! Oh.

48
- Hello.
- Hi.

49
Oh.

50
I'm Rob Donan.

51
Hi, Rob Donan.

52
I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

53
Oh, wow. Ha, ha.

54
Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

55
And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

56
Oh, I would love to have kids...

57
...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

58
What do you wanna do for dinner?

59
We could stay in and cook for ourselves.

60
- Hello.
It's Erika.

61
Oh, my God. The stalker!

62
Never mind. It's open.

63
Aah! Aah!

64
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

65
We might wanna have a backup plan,
though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.

66
Let's get out of here!

67
The one time they're not home!

68
Okay. Okay.

69
We'll leave.
When we pass her...

70
...she won't know me,
because we never met!

71
That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

72
She's coming!

73
It's me.
- Aah!

74
Uh, this is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

75
- You ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

76
Hi.

77
Erika!

78
Mr. Geller?
- Yes, hi.

79
Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

80
I was told you had a question.

81
I, uh... I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

82
...answers to the name Marcel?

83
Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

84
Marcel has passed on.

85
Oh, my God. What happened?

86
Well, he got sick,
and then he got sicker...

87
...and then he got a little better.

88
But then he died.

89
I can't believe this!

90
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

91
"Sometimes monkeys die. "

92
It's not a great saying...

93
...but it certainly is fitting today.

94
- Someone should've called me.
I'm sorry.

95
Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

96
...but here, it's just a gesture.

97
Zoo dollars?

98
Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

99
Well, it's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

100
Ooh.

101
I know.

102
I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker.

103
What is she like?

104
- Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery?
Mm-hm.

105
Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

106
And she's not crazy?

107
Oh, no, no.
She's a total wack job.

108
Yeah. She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

109
Oh, my God!

110
Oh. And he's going out with her?

111
He cannot pursue this.

112
Just because this woman thinks she can
see Joey through the magical box...

113
...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

114
Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

115
What are you looking at me for?
He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

116
Are you okay?

117
No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.

118
Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear...

119
That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

120
Oh.

121
Yeah.

122
I'm used to playing for grownups.

123
Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing, you know.

124
And kids...

125
...listen.

126
It's just a huge responsibility.

127
What?

128
Are you gonna kiss me?

129
I was thinking about it.

130
Okay.

131
Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!

132
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

133
Hi, Phoebe!

134
Ha, ha. Okay. Um...

135
...I'm gonna play, um, some songs
about grandparents, okay?

136
Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes

137
She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike

138
But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner

139
And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner

140
Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru

141
But the truth is she died
And someday you will too

142
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

143
- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

144
What?

145
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

146
...and just a little while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

147
Yeah, that was a tricky one.

148
In reality...

149
...that operation takes over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for two minutes.

150
Who's "they"?

151
No one.

152
Oh, Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

153
- Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.
- Ha, ha.

154
Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.

155
- But I won't.
Ha, ha.

156
Good.
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

157
No, seriously.

158
These hands...

159
...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

160
Oh, just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

161
- All right. Ha, ha. Just one.
- Ha-ha-ha.

162
Wow.

163
You're good at that.

164
Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

165
Is anyone here a doctor?

166
Oh, yes.

167
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

168
Dr. Drake Ramoray!

169
Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

170
Uh, hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

171
But, um, zoo dollars?

172
It's about your monkey.

173
It's alive.

174
I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

175
Uh, because, uh,
I'm a neurosurgeon...

176
...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...

177
..."foodal chokage. "

178
You know.

179
- I gotta tell you something...
- No, no, no.

180
You don't have to tell me anything.

181
You don't have
to explain yourself to me. Oh!

182
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

183
- That's...
- I should be happy to be near you.

184
Hey, I...

185
"Hey" what?

186
That's it. Just hey!

187
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

188
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

189
Hey.

190
There'll be times when you get older

191
When you'll want to sleep with people

192
Just to make them like you
But don't

193
'Cause

194
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

195
Everybody!

196
That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

197
- Excellent!
- Very informative!

198
Not at all inappropriate!

199
Thank you for coming, everybody.
There are cookies in the back.

200
That was great.

201
The kids loved you.

202
Yay! I rock!

203
And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

204
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

205
You were incredible!

206
Ha, ha. But?

207
- How did you know there was a "but"?
- I sense these things.

208
It was either "but" or "butter. "

209
The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

210
...they were hoping that...

211
...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

212
I can do that.

213
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
- Because that would be fantastic.
- Oh.

215
What? You wanna kiss me?

216
I'm thinking about it.

217
Ah, the bat.

218
Ambassador of darkness.

219
Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

220
Sightless specter of the macabre.

221
Buddy, my monkey?

222
Oh, yeah, right.

223
There was a break-in...

224
...a few months back. Inside job.

225
Your monkey was taken.

226
Oh, my God. The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead.

227
Pfft. The zoo!

228
You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

229
Uh, that's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

230
Of course they'll say he's dead.
They don't want the bad publicity.

231
It's all a great big cover-up.

232
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

233
That guy Lipson?

234
Lipson knows?

235
Hmm.

236
Lipson knows, huh?

237
Ah, hello, Mr. Possum.

238
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

239
- Taunting gravity...
- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

240
Word on the street...

241
Well, when I say "street," I mean
those little pretend streets here at the zoo.

242
Of course.

243
Your monkey found a new career...

244
...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

245
This is unbelievable!

246
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

247
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

248
Maybe.

249
But you already told me everything.

250
Check it out. He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey.

251
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?

252
I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find out where he is.

253
That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

254
Okay, hi again!

255
Hi, Phoebe!

256
Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

257
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

258
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

259
Then the farmer hits him on the head
And grinds him up

260
And that's how we get hamburgers

261
Now chickens

262
You're the only one who can save her, Drake!

263
Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God!

264
Well, there goes my whole belief system.

265
It's Erika.

266
Quick! Quick. Shut off the TV.

267
Wait, I wanna see what happens!

268
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

269
How can that be?
You were just kissing Sabrina.

270
Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

271
Hey, Erika. Come in.

272
How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

273
Right, they, uh, choppered me in.
Ha, ha.

274
What's up?

275
Oh, you're having a little party too.

276
- Is she here, huh, huh?
- Who?

277
Sabrina. I know about you two!

278
I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

279
It's not what you think.
That was...

280
You told me I was the only one!

281
All right, look. That's it.

282
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

283
I should have told you
a long time ago...

284
...but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?

285
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

286
Oh, my God. Do the people
at the hospital know about this?

287
Ha, ha.
Somebody wanna help me out here?

288
Oh, I know! I know!

289
Where am I?

290
University Hospital...

291
...the same place you've been
for the last 18 years.

292
How can you be here and there?

293
Ha, ha.
Because it's a television show.

294
Drake, what are you getting at?

295
I'm not Drake!

296
That's right. He's not Drake. He's...

297
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

298
Is this true?

299
Yes! Yes, it is true.

300
And I know this...

301
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

302
And then he told me
he would run away with me.

303
And he didn't!

304
And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

305
Is all this true?

306
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

307
You deserve much better than me, Erika.

308
You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

309
Go to Salem. Find him!

310
He's the guy for you.

311
Oh, Hans.

312
Hans?

313
Hans!

314
Yo, evil twin!

315
Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.

316
Good luck in Salem.

317
Take care.

318
I'll never forget you, Hans.

319
Ha, ha. All right.
The people who threw the water!

320
Helping you out!

321
Fired? Why?

322
The library board has had
a lot of complaints from parents...

323
...about some of the stuff in your songs.
- I can't believe it!

324
Did you tell your board about how
the kids want to hear the truth?

325
No.

326
I see.

327
Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddie songs?

328
No.

329
What do you want me to be?
Like some...

330
...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

331
You don't have to be Barney.

332
- Who's Barney?
- Eh...

333
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this:
He's healthy, he's happy...

334
...and he's here in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

335
You're kidding!

336
- This is amazing.
- I know.

337
I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

338
Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.

339
Okay.

340
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is who tells the truth?

341
Um, yeah, I guess that's me.

342
She's here!

343
Sometimes men love women

344
And sometimes men love men

345
And then there are bisexuals

346
Though some just say
They're kidding themselves

347
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

348
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la

349
This is exciting. I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

350
What, you never
look down in the shower?

351
Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make
one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?

352
Back up, please.

353
Back up. Come on, come on.

354
Excuse me.
Uh, where can we find the monkey?

355
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.

356
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

357
We, uh, used to live together.

358
Yeah. And I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with Flipper.

359
Ross, there he is!

360
Hey! Hey, buddy!

361
Marcel! Marcel!

362
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

363
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The lion sleeps tonight

364
They won't take you to the vet

365
You're obviously not
Their favorite pet

366
- Smelly cat, smelly cat
- Smelly cat, smelly cat

367
- It's not your fault
- It's not your fault

368
No

369
- Ha-ha-ha. I'm sorry.
- What?

370
What's wrong with that?

371
Um, ahem, I think you might wanna,
like, pick a more masculine note. Heh.

1
Ah, excuse me, this is a...

2
Closed set. We know. But we're
friends with the monkey, hmm?

3
Good morning.

4
Look who I brought!

5
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

6
Whoa, dude. Burn!

7
I don't get it.

8
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

9
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure,
starring in a movie and all.

10
Oh.

11
How big of a star is Marcel?

12
In human terms? I'd say...

13
...Cybill Shepherd.
Whoa.

14
Really?
Whoa.

15
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

16
- Hey, Sal?
- Mm-hm?

17
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

18
Excuse me?

19
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

20
- The one in the director's chair?
Gotcha.

21
Pheebs, walk with me.

22
Okay.

23
Um, why am I walking with you?

24
Well, uh, we're just going
over here so that we can get away from...

25
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

26
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

27
Is he looking? Is he looking?

28
We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

29
I can't do Chris' makeup.

30
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

31
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

32
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

33
...Jean-Claude Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

34
I'll talk to her.

35
I hate actors.

36
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

37
- Excuse me. Whoa.
- Ah!

38
Uh, is your name Chandler?

39
Uh, yes, it is.

40
Chandler Bing.

41
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

42
I'm Susie Moss.

43
Fourth grade? Glasses?

44
I carried a box of animal crackers
like a purse?

45
Susie Moss!

46
Right! Yeah! Wow!

47
You look...

48
Great job growing up.

49
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

50
Oh, I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

51
Heh, heh. Remember the class play?

52
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

53
Yes. Back then, I, uh, used humor
as a defense mechanism.

54
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

55
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

56
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

57
I didn't know he was in this movie.
He is so hot!

58
You think?

59
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

60
Did you see Timecop?

61
No. Was he any good in it?

62
Rachel, he totally changed time!

63
Wow.

64
- So why don't you go talk to him?
- Oh. Yeah.

65
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

66
He could hear me.

67
Oh.

68
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

69
Don't!

70
Tell him I cook!

71
Excuse me.

72
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

73
Um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy.
Ha, ha.

74
But, um, my friend over there...

75
...who cooks, by the way...

76
Um, she thinks you're cute. Heh.

77
You don't think I'm cute?

78
I don't know. Um...

79
Do you think you're cute?

80
We're getting off the track.
Um, I was supposed to tell you...

81
...my friend thinks you're cute.

82
What should I tell her?

83
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

84
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Huh?

85
Whoa. Ha, ha.

86
Makeup!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go.

87
Oh, uh...

88
Okay.

89
Um, how many times do I have to touch you
on the arm before you ask me on a date?

90
Well, uh, let's try one more.

91
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

92
I'll be there.

93
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

94
...I'll get to see your underwear.

95
No one was around to hear that?

96
- So, what'd he say?
- Ugh!

97
What a jerk!

98
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

99
Oh.

100
Naturally, you know, I said no.

101
Well...

102
Thanks, anyway.

103
He just kept asking...

104
...and asking, asking, asking...

105
If you want to go out with him, you can.

106
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...

107
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

108
Thank you.

109
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...

110
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

111
Oh, man. She's so smoking!

112
She's got the greatest set of...

113
No guys around, huh?

114
- Anybody need anything?
- Oh, I'll have an espresso.

115
Oh, I'll get it.

116
If I ask you to,
you'll end up drinking it yourself.

117
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

118
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

119
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

120
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

121
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

122
We can reschedule for Saturday.

123
Yeah, unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

124
Hey.

125
Stick a fork in me...

126
...I am done!

127
Uh...

128
Stick a fork what?

129
Like when you're cooking a steak.

130
Oh, I don't eat meat.

131
How do you know vegetables are done?

132
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

133
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

134
Mm.

135
- I've met the perfect woman.
- What?

136
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

137
...and then she turns to me and says:

138
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

139
What did you say?

140
I believe my exact words were:

141
How do you know if you wanna do that?

142
Oh, you just know.

143
Oh, we gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

144
No, no, no.

145
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

146
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

147
But, um...

148
...here's an idea.

149
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

150
Well, yes, actually...

151
...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.

152
And there were three of us in there.

153
I was thinking
it would be, um, kind of sexy...

154
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

155
You want me to wear your panties?

156
Could you?

157
If I was wearing your underwear...

158
...then, uh, what would you be wearing?

159
You're swell!

160
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

161
- Ooh.
... with mealworm.

162
Ah.

163
- Candle. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

164
What do you think is
gonna happen here tonight?

165
Hello.

166
Oh, hi, are you on your way over...?

167
Oh.

168
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

169
It's no big deal.

170
It's not like I, uh, had anything
special planned, you know.

171
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

172
Okay. Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

173
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.

174
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing...

175
Do you think I can't see you
in the TV set?

176
Monica, if there's something
you'd like to share...

177
You had no right to date him!

178
- That's the most ridiculous...
- You sold me out!

179
- I did not!
- You absolutely...

180
Would you let me talk!

181
Did you just flick me?

182
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was...

183
- Ow, that hurt!
- Ow.

184
Quit flicking!

185
Ow! Stop flicking!

186
You flicked me first!

187
Ow!

188
Ow!

189
Okay, no, no.

190
Let's not do this!

191
- Come on. Happy thoughts.
No! No!

192
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

193
No! Ow! No!

194
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God!

195
Oh! Ow!

196
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

197
- Ow.
- Ow.

198
Ow, ow, ow.

199
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

200
- Oh! You want me to stop seeing him?
- Uh-huh.

201
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

202
- Is that what you want?
- Okay.

203
Oh, that's what you want?

204
Yes.

205
- Fine!
- Fine!

206
There we go.

207
- Ow.
- Oh.

208
Ha. If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

209
Thanks for letting me tag along.

210
Forget about it.

211
- How you doing there, squirmy?
- I'm hanging in.

212
And a little out.

213
So assistant to the director?

214
That's an exciting job.
You must have a ton of responsibilities...

215
I don't do the casting.

216
So, what are you guys gonna eat?

217
How come all I can think about
is putting that ice in my mouth...

218
...and licking you all over?

219
Because I went to an all-boys high school,
and God is making up for it?

220
I want you right here...

221
...right now.

222
Right now, right here?

223
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

224
They do have the shrimp.

225
- Oh.
- Meet me in the bathroom.

226
I'm going to the bathroom now.

227
Come on.

228
All right, mister.

229
Let's see those panties.

230
Alrighty.

231
Ooh. Ooh.

232
But you know what would be even sexier?

233
What?

234
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

235
Oh.

236
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

237
Take your clothes off.

238
But, uh, I hope you realize this means...

239
...we'll miss hearing about the specials.

240
Come on, hurry!

241
Do you want this done quick or done right?

242
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

243
Oh, oh. Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

244
So you want me
to, uh, clench anything or?

245
Susie?

246
This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.

247
- Huh? What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

248
What do I mean?

249
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

250
What? What do you mean?

251
My skirt...

252
...you lifted. Kids laughing!

253
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

254
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

255
Well, um...

256
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

257
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

258
I can't believe this. Ha, ha.

259
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

260
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

261
Can you beat up that guy?

262
Yeah.

263
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

264
Oh, this is so wild.

265
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

266
Normally, I would not do it.

267
Yeah?

268
What made you make the exception for me?

269
Rachel told me, uh...

270
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.

271
By the way,
Drew has some ground rules and...

272
- Say you're sorry!
- No!

273
Say it!

274
No! I'm not gonna!

275
- Say it! Say it! Great!
- Oh!

276
Rachel.

277
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

278
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

279
Say you're sorry.

280
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

281
Let's play.

282
What are you gonna do?

283
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

284
You don't have the guts.

285
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

286
Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!

287
This is crazy!

288
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

289
Yes, that's right.

290
But still...

291
Look at your purse!

292
Look at your sweater!

293
Look at yourselves!

294
I'll help you fix your sweater.

295
I'll help you...

296
...throw out your purse.

297
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

298
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

299
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

300
Joey?

301
Ma?

302
Joey!

303
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

304
She took off with my clothes!

305
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

306
I'm wearing panties.

307
Huh.

308
You, uh, always wear panties?

309
No, no. This is the first time.

310
Wow. Talk about your bad luck!

311
I mean, the first time you try panties
and someone walks off with your clothes.

312
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

313
Let me see!

314
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

315
All right, all right!

316
Whoa.

317
Someone's flossing!

318
Joey, some people don't like that.

319
Chandler's wearing panties.

320
What?

321
- Let me see!
You don't have to see!

322
Hi, tushy!

323
- One of you give me your underpants.
- Oh, no.

324
I'm not wearing any.

325
How can you not be wearing any?

326
Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot-pink thong.

327
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

328
Hey.

329
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

330
Keep your panties on.

331
Hey. Hey.

332
- And I'm in the movie!
- Hey.

333
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

334
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

335
- Hey!
- Oh.

336
Oh, Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

337
Uh, that's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

338
You know, he's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

339
Oh, my God!

340
What?

341
I think I want to write a song about all this.

342
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

343
Ooh, except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

344
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

345
- How long you been waiting to say that?
- About 20 minutes!

346
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

347
Cut!

348
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

349
Cut!

350
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

351
- Mommy!
- Ah.

352
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!

1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
Hold on a second.

3
Nice. Nice.

4
I got you something.

5
- What's this?
- Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

6
I don't know what Big Leon told you,
but it's a thousand...

7
...if you want me for the whole night.

8
- What is this for?
- Well, I'm making money now.

9
And this is paying you back
for headshots, electric bills...

10
...and so many slices of pizza
I can't even count.

11
- I love you, man.
- Well, thanks, man.

12
Now I can get my pony.

13
Hey. This is a little extra something
for always being there for me.

14
Wow, I don't know what to say.

15
- Eh? What do you say?
- I don't know.

16
It's a bracelet.

17
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

18
"To my best bud. "

19
Thanks, best bud.

20
- Put it on.
- Oh. Now?

21
No, something this nice should be saved
for a special occasion.

22
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

23
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

24
Oh, man!

25
You are so wearing that bracelet!

26
I so am!

27
Oh! Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

28
It'll probably slow it down at first...

29
...but once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

30
- This all looks good.
- Great.

31
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job?

32
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

33
All right.

34
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

35
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

36
No, just the salad will be fine.

37
You got it.

38
Now I want you to tell me
what you're doing while you're doing it.

39
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

40
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?

41
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.

42
Don't. I like it dirty.

43
That's your call.

44
So, uh, what are you going to do next?

45
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.

46
Are they firm?

47
- They're okay.
- You sure they haven't gone bad?

48
You sure they're not very, very bad?

49
Ahem. No, really, they're okay.

50
You gonna slice them up real nice?

51
I was going to do them julienne.

52
I'm out of here!

53
Hello?

54
Rachel's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

55
All right. And how do we spell Casey?

56
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

57
Okay, bye-bye.

58
Hey, who's this Casey?

59
Some guy she met at the movies.

60
What does he want with her?

61
I'm guessing he wants to
do a little dance...

62
...you know, make a little love...

63
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

64
I don't know. I don't...

65
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

66
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

67
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

68
Or Rachel and I should be together...

69
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

70
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

71
Now how do you know that?

72
Because she's your lobster.

73
Oh, she's going somewhere.

74
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

75
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

76
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like...

77
Hey, you feeling better?

78
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
actually got the interview off me.

79
So do you have any other possibilities?

80
Yeah. There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

81
Monica, if you want,
I can lend you money.

82
No, no. If I couldn't pay you
back right away...

83
...then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.

84
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

85
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

86
Might as well
make some money off of them.

87
- The man's got a point.
- Ohh.

88
What is that sparkly thing?

89
That thing? It's a, uh...

90
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

91
No, no.

92
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

93
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

94
Hi.
- Hi.

95
- Hi, darling.
So what's this?

96
Some of your old stuff.

97
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.

98
Wow, that is a surprise!

99
Just one little question.
Why not Ross' room?

100
Gosh, we talked about that...

101
...but your brother had so many science
trophies, plaques, merit badges...

102
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.

103
God forbid!

104
- Ohh.
- Hi.

105
Hi, Rachel. Aww.

106
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

107
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

108
I can't say any of us were surprised.

109
Your parents have been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

110
- Oh.
- Especially after that incident in Hawaii.

111
What? What incident?

112
Um, no, no.
I must be thinking of someone else.

113
Maybe me! Ha!

114
Don't you have some folding to do?
Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.

115
Want a refill?
- No. I'm all right, thanks.

116
You gotta give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

117
Ahem.

118
Dude, 11:00,
totally hot babe checking you out.

119
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

120
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

121
- I'm Gail.
- Chandler.

122
I... I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

123
What?

124
This is excellent!

125
He could've gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

126
But no! He has to get me
the "woman repeller"!

127
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

128
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

129
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T collection!

130
Chandler. Chandler.

131
"I pity the fool that puts on
my jewelry! I do! I do!

132
I pity that fool... " Ay.

133
Hey, man!
We were just doing some impressions.

134
Do your Marcel Marceau.

135
That's actually good.

136
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he been talking to her?

137
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

138
I think she's okay.

139
Look at that! See how she's
pushing him away and he won't budge?

140
I'm gonna do something.

141
We'll get a condo right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

142
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

143
What?

144
Ross Geller.

145
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

146
What are you doing?

147
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

148
I don't believe it!

149
If it works out, we'll have something
to tell the grandkids!

150
You sure will.

151
I've gotta go.

152
- Take care.
Okay.

153
- See you later.
Ohh.

154
You're welcome.

155
- What?
- I was saving you.

156
Saving me from the pleasant conversation
with the interesting man?

157
- From where I was...
- Okay, Ross, listen to me.

158
I am not yours to save.

159
- But you are.
- What?

160
Uh, well, um... You're my lobster.

161
Okay. Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

162
No, you're my lobster.

163
See, um... Lobsters...

164
Uh, in the tank, when they're old...

165
...they get with the...
They walk around holding the claws.

166
In the tank!
You know, with...

167
...with the holding and...

168
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

169
Do the claws again.

170
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

171
Let's talk... What about us?

172
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

173
- No, but...
- No! Listen to me!

174
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

175
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

176
I'm tired of being clobbered,
you know?

177
It's just not worth it.

178
Well, but...

179
No "but," Ross.

180
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

181
Except... Except that what?

182
No. No.

183
Accept that.

184
Oh.

185
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

186
Wow. You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

187
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh? What do you say?

188
Okay, that's my bad.

189
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

190
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

191
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

192
What about the fact that you insulted
the bracelet and you made fun of me?

193
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

194
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

195
Come on, man!
I said I was sorry a hundred times.

196
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

197
...wrist.

198
But if you want to stay in there
and be mad...

199
...you just, you stay in there.

200
You know what the...

201
I am here, on my knees...

202
...holding up these couch cushions...

203
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

204
Much like they did
in biblical times.

205
Though you may haveth anger now...

206
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

207
I'm just saying! It's right there!

208
- Hey, guys.
Hi, darling.

209
Where's my grandson?
You didn't bring him?

210
No. He's at Carol and Susan's today.

211
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

212
I'm just saying!

213
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

214
- Where have you been?
- Emotional hell.

215
So did they lend you the money?

216
No, I haven't asked them yet.

217
Come on, Monica, do it.

218
Hey, you guys.

219
Monica has some news.

220
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

221
...I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

222
- Why?
- Because they made me.

223
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

224
Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica
we're talking about.

225
We taught her well.

226
- Ten percent of your paycheck goes where?
In the bank.

227
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

228
She's gonna be fine.

229
If you need a little extra...

230
...you know where to find it.

231
Anything larger back there?

232
I can't believe it!

233
Would you stop already?

234
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

235
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

236
For about the fact I just dropped $400
to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.

237
Bring on the hay!

238
Hey!

239
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

240
Guess what Gunther found?

241
Ohh!

242
Hey, now you have two!

243
Oh, now you have two.

244
What am I gonna do?

245
Hey.

246
How come you have two?

247
This one's for you.

248
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

249
I know how much this means to you...

250
...and I also know this is
about more than jewelry.

251
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds. "

252
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!

253
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

254
That's what they'll call us!

255
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

256
You have dinosaur checks?

257
Yeah. You get your money
and you learn something.

258
What's wrong with that?

259
Nothing.

260
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

261
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

262
Hey, Mon, what is this?

263
Oh, um...

264
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

265
Oh, I thought that's what they used
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

266
Hey, what's on this videotape?

267
You got me. Let's put it in.

268
- Hi.
- Hey.

269
Over here, Jack. Okay.

270
Rachel's coming up the path.

271
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

272
Can you get this?

273
Oh, my God!

274
What is with your nose?

275
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

276
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

277
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Ah!

278
- We don't have to watch.
- Yeah, we do.

279
Come on!
It's fun!

280
Get a shot of Monica.

281
- Where's Monica?
Over here, Dad!

282
Wait. How do you zoom out?

283
There she is!

284
Some girl ate Monica!

285
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

286
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

287
Oh, you look so great!

288
So do you! You look beautiful!

289
Oops.
What?

290
I think I got mayonnaise on you.

291
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

292
Everybody smile!

293
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

294
It is off.
- It is not! What's with the red light?

295
It's the off light. Right, Ross?

296
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

297
- You look pretty tonight.
- Oh, thanks.

298
- What are you doing this summer?
- I'm gonna hang out...

299
...work on my music.

300
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

301
Let me see. I don't know.
What are you gonna do...

302
Oh! The guys are here!

303
- This summer?

304
Work on your music?

305
Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!

306
You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.

307
His name was in the paper.

308
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

309
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.

310
There.

311
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

312
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

313
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.

314
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

315
I have a wonderful idea.

316
You should take Rachel to the prom.

317
- Doubtful.
- Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

318
All right, go on. This thing's heavy.

319
Your mother's right. Take her.
You can wear my tux.

320
She won't wanna go with me.

321
Of course she would!
You're a college man!

322
- I don't know.
- Well, come on.

323
Don't you wanna find out?

324
I can't believe I can't go to the prom!

325
This is so harsh!

326
- Hold my board.
- Attaboy! Attaboy!

327
I think we've seen enough.

328
- Let's turn it off.
- No, no, no!

329
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

330
Come on, kid. Let's go!

331
My! Are you handsome!
Let's show them!

332
Just a sec, Dad.

333
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

334
Okay, Dad.

335
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining...

336
Oh, no.

337
Bye! Don't wait up!

338
Chip!

339
Oh, dear!

340
Jack. How do I turn this off?

341
Press the button.

342
Which one? Which button? Jack!

343
The button! The button!

344
I can't believe you did that.

345
Yeah, well...

346
See? He's her lobster!

347
Dance with him!

348
Mom, I'm hungry!

349
Dance with your father.

350
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

351
All right.

352
Oh, Jack!
Oh, Judy!

353
Oh, Judy!

1
All right, no peeking. No peeking.

2
No peeking. No peeking!

3
All right, all right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
All right. Open your eyes!

5
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure.

6
Huh? Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

7
- Congratulations!
- I know! Ha-ha-ha.

8
Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

9
So, uh, which one is mine?

10
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

11
Not that one.

12
Oh, yes!

13
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

14
Oh.

15
- Do we dare?
- We dare.

16
Oh.

17
Oh!

18
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

19
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

20
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

21
They never would have survived
in the wild.

22
This screen is amazing.

23
- Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
Uh-huh.

24
Rose Marie really belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

25
- Hi, you guys.
Hey.

26
Hey.

27
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

28
Whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh.

29
So, uh, how was your day?

30
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.

31
Uh, sun shining, birds chirping.

32
Really? Mine too.

33
Hey, cool! Mine too!

34
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
I gotta get to the museum. So, um...

36
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

37
Oh.

38
Bye, guys!

39
Bye.
Bye.

40
- Tonight?
Hey, whoa.

41
- What's tonight?
- It is our first official date.

42
Our first date.

43
Uh, ha, ha. Hello?

44
Hi.

45
Tonight? You're supposed to waitress
for me? My catering thing?

46
- Any of that trigger anything?
- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

47
This is our first date.

48
- Yes, but my mom got me this job.
- I can be a waitress!

49
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

50
- Really, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

51
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

52
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

53
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.

54
Um, give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

55
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

56
It's James Bond!

57
- Sorry we're late.
- That's okay. Come on in.

58
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

59
Dr. Burke, it's me.

60
Monica?

61
My God! You used to be so...

62
I mean, you've...
You must have lost like...

63
- You look great.
- Thank you.

64
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

65
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to meet you.

66
So how you been?
- Great. How have you been?

67
Oh, obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

68
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

69
The head tilt?

70
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

71
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

72
Oh.

73
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

74
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.

75
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay. "

76
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine. "

77
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

78
Of course, the divorce only left me
with four CDs to change.

79
Oh, that's too bad.

80
I'll survive.

81
Ward. With a reverse.

82
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

83
But listen...

84
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

85
Ring 20. Geller/Green.

86
They'll let you in, okay?

87
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

88
Okay, thanks.

89
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

90
What if we have to pee?

91
I'll cancel the sodas.

92
Get back out there. It's your party!

93
But they're so dull.
They're all ophthalmologists.

94
You're an ophthalmologist.

95
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

96
Ha, ha. That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

97
But you stay out there!

98
- You see?
- All right, I tell you what.

99
I'll come get you in five minutes with
some sort of, um, kebob emergency.

100
Okay.

101
Ah. Better.

102
Oh, God, here we go.

103
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

104
Watch this.

105
Who needs glasses?

106
- You are so smitten.
- I am not!

107
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

108
Oh.

109
- You should ask him out.
- Dr. Burke?

110
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grown-up.

111
So? You two are totally into each other.

112
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

113
So you're never gonna see him again?

114
Not never.

115
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

116
- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
- Yeah, but, you know, uh...

117
...27 is a dangerous eye age.

118
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

119
...hard to follow.

120
I told you there'd be subtitles.

121
I know.

122
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

123
Oh.

124
Monica?

125
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

126
- Honey, I'm just checking.
- Oh.

127
- Ahem. Monica?
- Mon?

128
- Monica?
Mon?

129
Monica?

130
What?

131
- What?
- I'm sorry.

132
I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

133
...it was like,
"Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"

134
Sorry.

135
And that's funny why?

136
Well, it's not. Uh...

137
I mean, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

138
I mean, it's you.

139
- You know, it's us.
- Mm.

140
I mean, we're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

141
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

142
Okay.

143
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

144
I know, I know, I know!

145
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

146
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.

147
I'm good. I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

148
No, see, now I can't, because, uh...

149
...I'm feeling too self-conscious.

150
- Just one cheek.
- No. Ha.

151
The moment's gone.

152
- I'll back up into your hands.
- That's romantic.

153
Touch it.
No.

154
Oh, come on, squeeze it.
No!

155
Rub it?
No.

156
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

157
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...

158
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

159
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

160
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.

161
Thanks.

162
- Hey.
- Hey.

163
Ah.

164
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

165
That was 14 hours ago.

166
- So how'd it go?
- Well...

167
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

168
...and, uh, she started laughing?

169
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...

170
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

171
- She laughed at you?
- Yeah.

172
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

173
You know,
I just want it to be perfect...

174
...and right and...

175
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

176
- It's the Miracle Wax!
- It certainly is a miracle.

177
- Hi, you guys.
Hey.

178
- Hey.
Hi.

179
Listen, I was, um, thinking about...

180
Listen, can you guys speak up?

181
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

182
Okay, listen.

183
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

184
No. You know,
there's no need to make it up... How?

185
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um...
Ahem, a romantic dinner...

186
...with, um, candles and wine.

187
And then, uh, ahem,
maybe going back to my place...

188
...for, um, dessert.

189
Hmm.

190
That sounds...

191
...perfect? Heh.

192
- What's this?
- Would you get us a couple of beers?

193
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

194
Really?

195
Yeah, that's my job.

196
All right. Look up.

197
Look down.

198
Now, open your eyes and look down.

199
That's right.

200
Look into the light.

201
Now look at me.

202
Okay.

203
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

204
Good. They feel good.

205
In my head.

206
Um, so...

207
- It was great to see you.
- You too.

208
You too.

209
Okay, um...

210
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

211
- Drops!
- What?

212
Drops. Here, they're free.

213
Thanks. Uh, so...

214
I guess I better be going.

215
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll see you later.

216
- Thanks again.
- Oh.

217
Oh.

218
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

219
Hey, whoa, hey, whoa.
- Oh, oh.

220
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

221
No. Inside good.

222
Outside bad.

223
You guys are so pathetic.

224
Oh, Xanadu!

225
Oh!

226
She's one of us now.

227
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

228
- Hey.
- Hey.

229
We just wanted to stop by
and, uh, say good night.

230
Good night.

231
They won't even turn their heads.

232
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

233
No, she's lying.

234
Stop sending food to our apartment!

235
Why are you dressed up?

236
You're not the only one
who has a date.

237
- What? You have a date? Who with?
- No one.

238
- Come on, what's his name?
- Nothing.

239
Come on, tell me.

240
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

241
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

242
I promise. What?

243
- It's Richard Burke.
- Who's Richard Burke?

244
Is that Dr...? Dr. Burke?

245
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

246
...should that bother me?

247
I love that man. He's like, uh...

248
...a brother to Dad.

249
Well, for your information...

250
...he is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

251
Dr. Burke is sexy?

252
Oh, God!

253
Absolutely!

254
Damn!

255
It's the museum again. Can I...? Oh.

256
- You know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.
- When?

257
When I was, um, 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

258
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

259
- Oh, you are so lucky!
- I know. Ha-ha-ha.

260
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

261
No, no.

262
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

263
Well, maybe he was nervous.

264
Oh, look! I can't believe this!

265
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

266
Why don't they just
give him a microwave? Heh.

267
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

268
You know, I... It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

269
- That's okay. It's fine.
- Karl!

270
Oh, God.

271
- Wow! Is that Michelle?
- Yep.

272
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

273
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru...

274
Emotional.

275
- You know, she's having another baby.
- Mm.

276
- I thought she just had one.
- No, no. Henry's almost 2.

277
And he's talking and everything. Here.

278
Aw.

279
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

280
In all fairness,
his other grandpa's a drunk, but still...

281
Whoa. You're a grandpa.

282
Yeah.

283
Are we nuts here?

284
I don't know. Maybe.

285
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

286
I didn't need to know that.

287
I guess 21 years is a lot.

288
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

289
Yeah.

290
So...

291
- So maybe we should just...
- Yeah.

292
Yeah.

293
Maybe...

294
Wow.

295
This really sucks.

296
Yeah, it sure does.

297
Ah.

298
Uh, we don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

299
No, there's no rush or anything.

300
Pizza delivery!
- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

301
- Rach?
- Oh.

302
- I'm done. Ah.
- Ahem.

303
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is, uh, Sorentino's.

304
I'm sorry. Let's, uh...
Why don't we find someplace else?

305
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

306
No, no, we won't.

307
We won't?

308
Come on.

309
Okay, that's dead, right?

310
- What is this? What are we doing?
- Shh.

311
- Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?
- Grape.

312
Okay, now...

313
...sit.

314
Okay.

315
Oh, my God!

316
Billions ofyears ago,
Earth was...

317
Sorry.

318
Ah. So, what are we looking at?

319
Well, uh, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

320
That is Ursa Major.

321
- Really?
- No idea. It could be. Could be.

322
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

323
Oh, that's okay.

324
- You were worth the wait.
- Oh.

325
And I don't just mean tonight.

326
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

327
Whoa.

328
You're not laughing.

329
This time it's not so funny.

330
No, I don't want to fall in love

331
This love is only gonna break your heart

332
Aah!
Oh!

333
Okay, loosen the knot.
Loosen the knot.

334
Sorry, sorry.

335
What a wicked game you play

336
Aah! Oh, God! Oh.

337
Honey?

338
Oh, that's okay.

339
What?

340
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

341
Oh, thank God!

342
No, I don't want to fall in love

343
This love is only gonna break your heart

344
Hey.

345
Hey, you.

346
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

347
I know. It is pretty unbel...

348
What?
- We're not alone.

349
- Is that the fire alarm?
- Yeah.

350
Oh, it's not warm yet.
We still have time.

351
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool!

1
Man, this is weird.

2
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

3
That's what's weird?

4
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

5
Whoa, yuck!

6
What?

7
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

8
You licked and you put.

9
Yeah, so?

10
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

11
You used my toothbrush?

12
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

13
Mine is the red one!

14
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

15
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

16
...but we can use the same soap?

17
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

18
The next time you shower...

19
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

20
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
Look at you fancy lads!

22
What's the occasion?

23
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

24
He's having a brunch.

25
Ready when you are.

26
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

27
You guys are getting tattoos?

28
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

29
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

30
I'm getting a lily.

31
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

32
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

33
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

34
What?

35
What's on your shoulder?

36
A chip.

37
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
A tattoo?

38
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

39
- Hi.
- Hi.

40
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

41
No. Sorry, I don't.

42
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

43
What if it doesn't come out right?

44
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

45
Why is everyone staring at me?

46
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

47
Richard's going to the party too?

48
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

49
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

50
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

51
No, I think you should tell them.

52
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

53
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

54
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

55
"God, I hope they get together. "

56
Shall we?

57
Okay, wait.

58
You know what?

59
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

60
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

61
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

62
We're here!

63
Hi, kids!
The children!

64
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

65
Happy birthday!

66
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

67
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

68
So you kids take the train in?

69
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

70
Speaking of whom...

71
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

72
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

73
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

74
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

75
Are we still on that?

76
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

77
She's probably not even pretty.

78
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

79
Can you believe this place?

80
I know. This is a great apartment.

81
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

82
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

83
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

84
Seriously.

85
Hey.

86
We were just saying, great apartment!

87
Thanks. You want it?

88
I'm moving to a bigger place.

89
You should take this one.

90
Can you see me in a place like this?

91
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

92
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

93
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

94
On TV.

95
Stop talking. Okay!

96
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

97
I am not telling you guys anything.

98
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

99
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

100
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

101
Would you let it go?

102
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

103
You got your own little speedster.

104
- Seriously, it's not like that.
Tell you what.

105
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could...

106
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

107
What? I'm kidding!

108
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

109
Okay, Rach.

110
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

111
- Well, I...
- I like this lily.

112
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

113
She had a more open, giving spirit.

114
Foghorn Leghorn!

115
Blond girl?
You're in room two.

116
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

117
- Here we go!
- Uh-huh.

118
You're not going.

119
Uh-huh.

120
Is this because of what Ross said?

121
No.

122
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

123
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

124
Come on, what is this, 1922?

125
What's 1922?

126
Just, you know, a long time ago.

127
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

128
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

129
Do you want this tattoo?

130
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross...

131
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

132
No.

133
Who is the boss of you?

134
You?

135
No. You are the boss of you!

136
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

137
Go!

138
How you doing?

139
I'm a twinkie!

140
Really? I'm a hero.

141
This is so hard.

142
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

143
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

144
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

145
My parents are dead.

146
God, you are so lucky!

147
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

148
Just hang in there, okay?

149
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

150
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

151
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

152
Honey.

153
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

154
I have no idea.

155
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

156
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

157
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

158
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

159
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

160
Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

161
So, Jack...

162
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

163
Of course not.

164
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

165
Oh, Jack, stop!

166
Come on!

167
It's my birthday!

168
Can we drop this?

169
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

170
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

171
You want it.

172
Why would I want another apartment?

173
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

174
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

175
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

176
- What?
- I'm sorry.

177
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

178
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

179
...that I don't need a roommate.

180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't need a roommate either.

181
I can afford to live here by myself.

182
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

183
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

184
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

185
We're not Bert and Ernie.

186
You know what?

187
If this is the way you feel...

188
...then maybe you should take it.

189
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

190
Maybe I will!

191
- Fine with me!
- Great!

192
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

193
...the spoons!

194
Whose drink can I freshen?

195
Almost time for cake!

196
Mon?

197
Mon, are you okay?

198
- Remember that video of Mom and Dad?
- Yeah?

199
- Well, I just caught the live show.
- Ew!

200
- Hey there.
- What?

201
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

202
Really?

203
Richard?

204
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

205
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

206
That's an idea.

207
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

208
- Oh?
- Oh?

209
Oh...

210
She never tells us anything.

211
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

212
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

213
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

214
Is that crystal?

215
So who's the mystery man?

216
Well, he's a doctor.

217
A real doctor?

218
No, a doctor of meat.

219
Of course he's a real doctor.

220
And he's handsome.

221
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

222
Well, that's wonderful.

223
Mom, it's okay.

224
It is, Judy.

225
Jack!

226
Could you come in here for a moment?

227
Now!

228
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

229
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

230
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

231
I'm the twinkie.

232
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

233
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in...

234
Oh, please! A relationship?

235
Yes, a relationship!

236
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

237
Really?

238
Yes.

239
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

240
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

241
When did I say that?

242
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

243
Happy birthday to you

244
Happy birthday to you

245
Happy birthday, dear Jack

246
Happy birthday to you

247
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

248
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

249
Okay, let me see yours.

250
Let's see yours again.

251
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

252
Oh, no!

253
It's gone! That's so weird.

254
I don't know how, where it went.

255
You didn't get it?

256
No.

257
Why not?

258
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

259
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

260
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

261
And did you know
they do this with needles?

262
Really? You don't say?

263
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

264
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
I'm sorry about what...

266
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

267
Do we need to hug?

268
No, we're all right.

269
So I got you something.

270
Plastic spoons!

271
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

272
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

273
What?

274
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

275
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

276
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

277
I didn't think that was serious.

278
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

279
Well, it was a fight...

280
...based on serious stuff, remember?

281
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

282
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

283
...or whatever.

284
Well, there you go.

285
Hey, are you cool with this?

286
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

287
I've never been lower or wetter.

288
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

289
...bedroom into a game room.

290
Put the foosball table in there.

291
Why do you get to keep the table?

292
I did pay for half of it.

293
I paid for the other half.

294
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

295
All right, you're on.

296
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

297
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

298
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
Which sister?

300
So are you sorry that I told them?

301
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

302
Did you get it?

303
Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

304
Okay, really quick.

305
That's great!

306
Very tasteful.

307
- Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
Yes!

308
What? You didn't get one.

309
Okay. Well then, what is this?

310
What are we looking at?

311
That blue freckle?

312
That's my tattoo.

313
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

314
I got her in the chair...

315
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

316
Okay, hi!

317
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

318
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

319
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

320
Oh, what a load of crap!

321
That is a dot!

322
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

323
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

324
You got a tattoo?

325
Maybe.

326
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

327
Well, let me see.

328
Well?

329
Well, it's really...

330
...sexy.

331
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

332
...wow!

333
Really?

334
Yeah, so...

335
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

336
I guess.

337
Save us some pizza.

338
Get it out of the corner!

339
Pass it! Pass it!

340
Stop talking to your men!

341
Yes!

342
And the table is mine.

343
Congratulations.

344
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

345
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

346
We'll be over there all the time.

347
Except when we are here.

348
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

349
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

350
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines...

351
Is that my bra?

352
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

353
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

354
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

355
Yeah, I remember.

356
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

357
You want me to...

358
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

359
Nah...

360
You keep it.
You need the practice.

361
Thanks.

362
So...

363
...I guess this is it.

364
Yeah, right.

365
I guess so.

366
Listen...

367
When am I gonna see you?

368
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

369
Right. Yeah. Okay.

370
Take care.

1
Huh? So, what do you think?

2
Casa de Joey.

3
Huh? I decorated it myself.

4
- Get out.
No.

5
Wow, Joey, this is, uh...

6
- Art.
- Art it is.

7
Well, check this out.
Is it a coffee table?

8
Is it, uh, a panther?
There's no need to decide.

9
Hey, nice pillow.

10
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

11
Hey, excellent water-table thing.

12
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

13
It makes me want to pee.

14
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge. Heh.

15
Hey, how come, uh,
Chandler didn't come?

16
Well, uh, it's because he had
a thing with the...

17
With the thing.

18
Right. I got it.

19
Why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

20
Yeah.

21
Uh, oh, oh, the best part. Come on.

22
Huh?

23
Hey.

24
Nice toilet.

25
No, no, no. Behind it.

26
- You have a phone in here?
- That's right.

27
I have a phone.

28
In here.

29
- Joey, promise me something.
- Yeah.

30
Never call me from that phone.

31
Okay, here we go.

32
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

33
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You are not gonna believe this.

34
I have just been discovered.

35
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

36
Anyway.

37
Promise you won't freak out
and say how great this is until I'm done.

38
Okay.
- Okay.

39
Uh, I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

40
...who said, ahem, that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

41
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat. "

42
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.
Ha, ha.

43
Okay.

44
And she wants to do a video.

45
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.

46
God. Okay.

47
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

48
- I'm done now.
Oh, that's great.

49
That's unbelievable. Oh.

50
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

51
- Get the what?
- There's a pie in the hood. Go.

52
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

53
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

54
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

55
Damn it, Ross.
Get your butt out of the bathroom.

56
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

57
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

58
What's going on?

59
Uh, your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour.

60
It's like I'm living with him again.

61
He's here when I go to sleep,
when I wake up, when I wanna shower.

62
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.

63
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

64
Get out, you doofus!

65
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

66
All yours.

67
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

68
I hope
you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

69
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

70
Cut it out.

71
I've never wanted you more.

72
So, what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

73
You know what they say:

74
Ask your slippers a question...

75
...you're going crazy.

76
- Hello?
Hey.

77
Hey.

78
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

79
Oh, that's okay.

80
You, uh... You had a thing.

81
Yeah, well,
I hear the place looks great.

82
Oh, forget about it.
I'm having a ball, ha.

83
How's the apartment doing?

84
Oh, hey, it's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

85
...fest.

86
Oh, well, great.

87
Yeah, I just...

88
...wanted to call and say hey.

89
Well, okay, then.

90
Was that the oven timer?

91
That's right, my friend.

92
- It's time for Baywatch!
- Baywatch!

93
Oh.

94
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

95
I can't believe
they promoted her to lieutenant.

96
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

97
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

98
Hey. Hey, they're running.

99
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

100
I say always keep them running.

101
All the time running.

102
Run.

103
Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.

104
But you wanted to live by yourself.

105
I did. I thought it'd be great.

106
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

107
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

108
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

109
You really think he'd take me?

110
We had a good talk last night...

111
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

112
I promise you,
he would definitely want you back.

113
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

114
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night. Heh.

115
I mean, it was...

116
It was like when we first
started living together.

117
Look, I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

118
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

119
He's decorated.

120
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

121
No, you're just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're just friends now.

122
You're not...

123
...roommates anymore.

124
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?

125
Okay. Ahem.

126
Smelly cat, smelly cat

127
What are they feeding you?

128
Smelly, smelly, smelly

129
Really bad smelling smelly cat

130
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

131
I mean, like, who was that?

132
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

133
Oh.

134
Oh, I thought
they were just watching me.

135
- Like at an aquarium, you know?
- All right.

136
- From the top.
- Okay. Ahem.

137
Smelly cat, smelly cat

138
What are they feeding you?

139
Smelly, smelly, smelly

140
Really bad smelling smelly cat

141
It's not your fault

142
Okay, sorry.

143
I'm just not getting...

144
...that everyone, um, gets...

145
...how smelly this cat actually is.

146
Maybe if we could talk about this...

147
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

148
Honey, we can talk about this.

149
It's just that it's costing
about $100 a minute to be in here.

150
Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

151
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

152
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

153
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

154
Yeah. Yeah.

155
Oh, were you taking a nap?

156
- I was.
- Oh, I...

157
Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

158
Hello?

159
Yeah, she's here,
but, uh, can she call you back?

160
Okay, thanks.

161
Call Joanna. Hi.

162
Did she leave a number?

163
Did you see me write one down?

164
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

165
Well, she'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

166
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.

167
- Look, you wanna get off my back?
- Get out of my face.

168
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

169
Hello?

170
Hi.

171
Yeah, no, she's right here.
Um, hold on.

172
Hi, Tony, can I call you back?

173
That's, uh...
That's my sister's boyfriend.

174
Give me that.

175
Okay.

176
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave
my diaphragm at your place?

177
Hi, Mom.

178
Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.

179
So, uh, how's the palace?

180
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking...

181
What's with the boxes?

182
Oh, uh, actually,
I, uh, have some news.

183
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

184
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

185
Nice to meet you.

186
- Likewise.
How you doing?

187
Uh, I'll take that.

188
It's, uh, what I came for, heh.

189
So this is new.
Where'd you two meet?

190
At the, uh, supermarket
in the, uh, ethnic-food section.

191
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

192
- It's a... I mean...
- Wow.

193
We got to talking. And, uh, he needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

194
Oh, now it's a spare room?

195
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

196
...and I have it to spare.

197
Right.

198
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.

199
I'll, uh... I'll see you guys.

200
Hey, Joe.

201
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

202
Is this guy great, or what?

203
Yeah.

204
Yeah, he is.

205
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is this guy?

206
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

207
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

208
- Hey.
Hey.

209
Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.

210
- It's "Smelly Cat," the video.
Oh, God.

211
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

212
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

213
Okay.

214
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

215
Oh, smoking.
- Oh, look at me.

216
Smelly cat, smelly cat

217
What are they feeding you?

218
Smelly cat, smelly cat

219
It's not your fault

220
Smelly, smelly, smelly

221
Really bad smelling smelly cat
It's not your fault

222
Smelly cat, smelly cat

223
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

224
I sound amazing!

225
They won't take you to the vet

226
You're obviously not their favorite pet

227
Smelly cat, smelly cat

228
It's not your fault

229
Oh, no

230
I've never heard myself sing before.

231
I mean, except in my own head. Oh.

232
This is so cool.
Now I can hear what you hear.

233
Pretty, uh, different, huh?

234
Oh, I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented.

235
Smelly cat, smelly cat

236
It's not your fault

237
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?

238
Eddie.

239
- Morning.
- Morning.

240
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.

241
- Where's the mail?
- Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.

242
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

243
No, Eddie likes it over there.

244
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs à la Eddie, huh.

245
Ooh. Ooh.

246
Oh, oh. That's great.

247
Huh.

248
What?

249
I thought you liked your eggs...

250
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, à la me.

251
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

252
Well, you guys...

253
...I'm out of here.

254
See you, pals.

255
See you.

256
- So how are you two getting along?
- Oh, I couldn't be happier.

257
Great, huh?

258
I'm happy for you.

259
All right, that's it!

260
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

261
...with his moving the mail and his:

262
"See you, pals. "

263
And now there's no juice!

264
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

265
There's another carton
right over there.

266
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

267
All right.

268
So, what's it about?

269
Eggs.

270
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine, huh?

271
- Well, I like both eggs equally.
- Oh, come on!

272
Nobody likes
two kinds of eggs equally.

273
You like one better,
and I wanna know which.

274
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

275
You took your eggs, and you left!

276
Did you really expect me
to never find new eggs?

277
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

278
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

279
- Ugh.
- Would you guys stop?

280
- It's my TV!
What?

281
- Quit it.
- Bite me!

282
Oh, my God.

283
Well, Monica keeps changing
the channel.

284
Aw, that's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

285
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

286
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

287
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

288
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

289
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

290
What do we do about this?

291
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

292
Not that!

293
This! Us!

294
Oh, my God, Ross, it's... You're just...

295
- Since you've been here, you're driving...
- Ow, ow.

296
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

297
I just can't stand you being here...

298
...all the time!

299
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

300
We're just having fun.

301
Fun? You think this is fun?

302
Yeah.

303
I thought we were fooling around,
like when, uh... When we were kids.

304
I hated you when we were kids.

305
- You hated me when we were kids?
- Yes.

306
I hated you.

307
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-I-have-to way...

308
...but basically, I hated your guts.

309
Why did you hate me?

310
Because you were mean to me...

311
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

312
That wasn't fun for you?

313
Uh-huh.

314
I can't believe you hated me.

315
But now I love you.

316
And not just because I have to.

317
Really?

318
Yeah.

319
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

320
I can do that.

321
- Then I won't have to kill you.
- Ha, ha.

322
So you wanna watch, uh,
Entertainment Tonight?

323
Yeah, thanks.

324
Tonight, America's premier
sports magazine...

325
...moves to primetime...

326
- You know what?
- What?

327
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

328
Oh, okay.

329
- Hey.
Hey.

330
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

331
...but, ahem, that is not me
singing on the video.

332
No.

333
Yes.

334
Well, how did you find out?

335
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

336
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

337
So, what are you gonna do?

338
I can't work with people
who would do this.

339
Sure.

340
I mean, this poor woman.

341
What woman?

342
The voice woman.

343
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

344
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

345
I have a video. Pay attention.

346
No, this voice woman,
she's so talented.

347
But according to the producer people...

348
...they said, like, she doesn't have
the right look or something. You know?

349
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

350
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

351
Or, you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and...

352
Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!

353
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.

354
Hey, Eddie.

355
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?

356
No, thanks, man.
I'm not, uh... Not really into sports.

357
Yeah, okay. All right.

358
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch.

359
Oh, what?

360
You like that show?

361
You don't?

362
Ha, ha, what...? No.

363
I mean, it's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

364
Well, that's the brilliance of it.

365
The pretty people.

366
And the running.

367
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

368
Oh, oh. Okay, man.

369
Smelly cat, smelly cat

370
What are they feeding you?

371
Everybody!

372
Smelly cat, smelly cat

373
It's not your fault

374
Monica.

375
They won't take you to the vet

376
Chandler.

377
You're obviously not their favorite pet

378
Joey.

379
You may not be a bed of roses

380
And you're no friend
To those with noses

381
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Sorry. Okay. Back to the chorus.

1
Oh, Drake.
I'm sorry, Amber.

2
It's just like Brad to have
to have the last word.

3
- I'm sorry I'm late. What happened?
- We wanna see the end.

4
- I want you, Drake.
- I know you do.

5
But you and I can never
be together that way.

6
- What?
- There's something I never told you.

7
I'm actually your half-brother.

8
- What?
- Huh?

9
So, what happens next?

10
Well, I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

11
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

12
...and that's where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

13
But it's cursed.

14
- So cool!
- God, that is good TV.

15
- Pheebs, play with me!
- No!

16
This game is grotesque.

17
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

18
...forced to play soccer forever? Ugh!

19
Hello? Human rights violation.

20
Don't feel so bad.
After they're done playing...

21
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a pretty good time.

22
Why don't you play with your roommate?

23
Eh, he's, uh...

24
He's not a big fan of foosball.

25
Uh-oh. Ooh. Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

26
No, he's all right. He just, uh,
spends most of his time in his room.

27
Maybe because you haven't
taken time to get to know him.

28
Let's remedy that, shall we?

29
- We don't need to remedy that.
- Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!

30
- What was that?
- Hi!

31
Um, I thought it'd be fun
if the three of us had beers...

32
...and got to know each other.

33
- All right. That sounds all right.
- Oh, good! Okay.

34
Oh, no, I have to go,
because I'm late for my, um...

35
...Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.

36
Um, tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train. "

37
- Have fun! Bye!
- That was so lame.

38
I know. Yeah, heh.

39
- Okay, talk to him.
- Ahem.

40
So you, uh, think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or?

41
Ha-ha-ha. That's good.
So who broke up with who?

42
You kidding? I broke up with her.

43
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

44
When everybody knows that
the, uh, capital of Cambodia is...

45
Is, uh...

46
It's not Sean Penn.

47
All right, I got a funny one. All right?

48
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

49
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

50
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

51
...I don't wanna see you anymore. "
Ha, ha.

52
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

53
...ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

54
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

55
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

56
That wasn't such a funny story, was it?

57
And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can

58
And the rest of the rats
Played maracas

59
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

60
- Phoebe's got another job, right?
- Heh.

61
Great set tonight, Pheebs.
Yes.

62
I know.

63
- We should get going.
- Mm.

64
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

65
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

66
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

67
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

68
Heh.

69
You don't need them.

70
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

71
Shut up. I'm happy.

72
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

73
Ahem. I just want to say...

74
...of all the guys that Monica
has been with, and that is a lot...

75
...I like you the best.
- Aw.

76
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

77
You hear that?

78
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

79
Not a lot.

80
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

81
Phoebe's dead.

82
- Hi.
- Hi.

83
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

84
Oh, uh, he's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

85
Can I take a message or...
Or a fish tank?

86
Thanks.

87
Come on in.

88
I'm Tilly.

89
Oh.

90
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

91
Yeah, your, uh, name came up...

92
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

93
He's kind of intense, huh?

94
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

95
- A little what?
... bit country?

96
Come on in, you roomie!

97
Hello, Tilly.

98
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

99
That was very thoughtful of you.

100
It's very thoughtful.

101
Well, okay then.

102
I'm gonna go. Bye.

103
Bye.
- Bye.

104
So we getting a fish?

105
You had sex with her, didn't you?

106
Pheebs! Check it out, check it out!

107
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!

108
- Page 42! Page 42!
- Okay, okay.

109
Okay. Ooh. Hey!

110
"New Doc on the Block,
Days ofour Lives Joey Tribbiani. "

111
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, cool picture!

112
- Ah.
- Oh, I look good.

113
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

114
Well, kind of, yeah.

115
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

116
The line in the script was:

117
"If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die. "

118
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

119
...she's not gonna live. "

120
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

121
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

122
Huh.

123
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

124
But you know what?

125
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

126
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

127
Makes up most of his lines.

128
Son of a...

129
Yeah. Write this, jerk-weed.

130
I fall down an elevator shaft?

131
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

132
Uh, I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

133
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

134
Right.

135
Uh, could you sign?

136
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

137
I don't think that's gonna affect
the plot of the show.

138
How can they do this to me?

139
All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.

140
Sorry.

141
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

142
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

143
...it's a very small percentage.
- Hey.

144
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

145
- Good night.
- Good night, Richard.

146
Good luck, Mon.

147
All right, before I tell you, uh, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

148
- Two.
- Two? Two? Heh.

149
How is that possible? I mean...

150
...have you seen you?

151
Well, I mean, what can I say?

152
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

153
Now you. That's two.

154
- Two it is. Heh.
- Mm-hm.

155
Okay, time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

156
Whoa, no, wait a minute now!

157
Come on, it's your turn.

158
Oh, come on!

159
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

160
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

161
Wow, I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

162
Tell me about it.

163
So, what's your magic number?

164
Ahh...

165
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

166
Well, ahem, there's you.

167
Better not be doing these in order.

168
Okay, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

169
- Ah.
- Barry.

170
And, uh, oh, Paolo.

171
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

172
Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

173
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

174
- Really?
- Oh, please.

175
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

176
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

177
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

178
Eddie! I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

179
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

180
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

181
...dropped off a fish tank and left!
End of story.

182
- Where's Buddy?
- Buddy?

183
My fish, Buddy.

184
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

185
Oh, this is unbelievable!

186
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

187
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

188
I didn't kill your fish!

189
Look, Eddie...

190
Would you look at what I'm doing?

191
Now that can't be smart.

192
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

193
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

194
Tangelo?

195
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

196
- Well, yeah.
- Well, that's not bad at all.

197
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

198
You're okay with it?

199
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

200
Oh, yay!

201
Okay, about that two.

202
What?

203
All right.

204
What about my two?

205
It just seems like
a really small number.

206
Right.

207
- And?
- And, well...

208
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

209
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

210
Honey, you are not an oat.

211
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

212
I've only slept with women I love.

213
You've only slept with two people.

214
Right.

215
Wow.

216
Oh, wow.

217
You know I love you too, right?

218
Now I do.

219
Ugh, Ross!

220
Ross, please listen to me.

221
Ross, you are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

222
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

223
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

224
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack,
and I'll stand in the corner...

225
...and tell knock-knock jokes.
- Ross! Agh!

226
God, Ross!

227
What you and I have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was...

228
Animal sex, animal sex?

229
So, what are you saying?

230
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

231
There's not even,
like, um, a little animal?

232
Not even, like...

233
...chipmunk sex?

234
Okay, Ross...

235
Try to hear me, okay?

236
I... Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.

237
- It was good with Paolo.
- Knock-knock.

238
But what you and I have
is so much better.

239
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

240
You know? I swear.

241
This is the best...

242
...I have ever had.

243
- Until now.
- Aah!

244
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

245
Richard told me he loved me.

246
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

247
Honey, that's great!

248
- I know!
- Ha, ha.

249
- I just can't find...
- Top drawer.

250
- Hurry.
- Why? You need one too?

251
Oh, yeah.

252
- Found them!
- Whoo.

253
There's only one.

254
- Monica!
- Hi.

255
Uh, we'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

256
Rachel?

257
- Hey.
- Hey.

258
- They're trying to decide something.
- Good. Good, good.

259
So is, um... So was your mustache...
Did it used to be different?

260
- No.
- Oh.

261
How do you, uh, you know,
keep it so neat?

262
- I have a little comb.
- Oh.

263
- What do you call that?
- A mustache comb.

264
Thank you.

265
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

266
- No!
- Okay, okay!

267
I will, I will, I will...

268
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

269
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

270
So were you in Nam?

271
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Gotcha.

272
One, two, three.

273
- Yes!
- Agh!

274
- Ah!
- Fine. Go have sex.

275
No! You have got it completely wrong!

276
John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.

277
Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.

278
No, you've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight...

279
- Honey? Ahem.
- What? Oh.

280
- Shall we?
- It's not gonna happen.

281
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

282
Uh, in the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand...

283
So when I woke up this morning...

284
...he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

285
Why?

286
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

287
Why would you kill his fish?

288
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

289
...you have to kill a fish.

290
Chandler, honey...

291
...I'm sorry.

292
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

293
- Yeah!
- Wait. He's not here yet.

294
He's on the show,
he knows what happens.

295
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

296
Amber...

297
...I want you to know
I'll always be there for you...

298
...as a friend and as your brother.

299
Oh, Drake.

300
Hard day, huh?

301
- First the medical award, now this?
- Yeah.

302
- Some guys are just lucky, I guess. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

303
Dr. Ramoray...

304
...report to first floor Emergency stat.
- Hmm.

305
Well, then...

306
...I, uh, guess that's me.

307
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wong?

308
No, no. They only said you.

309
Oh, okay. All right.

310
- I love you, Drake.
- Yeah, whatever.

311
- Oh, no!
Drake, look out!

312
- Did they just kill off Joey?
- No!

313
Now maybe.

314
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

315
I don't feel like talking!

316
Come on! We care about you.

317
We're worried about you.
And some of us have to pee!

318
I'm sorry, Joey.

319
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

320
- We came over as soon as we saw.
- How could you not tell us?

321
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

322
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

323
No, they said that when they found
my body, my brain was so smashed in...

324
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

325
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

326
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

327
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

328
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

329
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

330
Oh, good, here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

331
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

332
What? To me, that's nice.

333
It's gonna be okay. You know that.

334
No, I don't.

335
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

336
...and you think
that when you get it...

337
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

338
But this so was.

339
It changed everything.

340
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

341
...and I was pre-approved!

342
Huh? I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

343
I'm sorry, man.

344
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

345
...but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

346
No, that means nothing to me.

347
Ahh!

348
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

349
Yeah, all right.

350
Are these raisins?

351
Uh, sure, why not?

352
Listen, Eddie. Um, ahem.

353
I've been thinking about
our living situation and, uh...

354
Why are you smiling?

355
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

356
I named him, uh...

357
...Chandler, you know, after you.

358
Well, that's not even a real fish.

359
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

360
So, what's your point, man?

361
Okay, good night.

362
You big freak of nature.

363
- Aah.
- Hey.

364
Hey.

365
- Hey.
- Hey.

366
- Whoo. Brisk tonight.
- Oh, man.

367
- Let's never speak of this.
- You got it.

1
Hey, Eddie. Aah!

2
- What are you doing here?
- Watching you sleep.

3
Why?

4
It makes me feel, um, peaceful.

5
Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.

6
I can't sleep now!

7
Oh, you want me to sing?

8
No. Look.

9
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

10
Oh, what are you talking about?

11
Hannibal Lecter?

12
Better roommate than you.

13
No.

14
I don't think you're being fair!
One night you see me, you get scared.

15
What about the other nights
when you don't see me, huh?

16
Last night you went
and got some water...

17
...and I was nice enough to hide
behind the door. What that about, huh?

18
- I didn't realize that.
- Ah.

19
Get out now!

20
Okay. You really want me out?

21
Yes, please.

22
Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

23
I want you out.

24
I want to hear it from your lips.

25
Where'd you hear it before?

26
Oh, right, all right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

27
I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

28
Thank you.
I heard that.

29
- Thanks.
- Hey.

30
- Hey.
- Hey.

31
Well, look at you!

32
Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

33
You like it?

34
This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

35
- "You know what I don't have?"
- A mirror?

36
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

37
Wow! For a guy who's recently lost
his job, you're in a good mood.

38
I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

39
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of our Lives.

40
Huh? That's got to have
some kind of cachet.

41
Cachet? Jaunty?

42
Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

43
I'm gonna get some coffee.

44
- Hey.
Hey.

45
Oh! So? Did you read the book?

46
Oh, my God. It was incredible!

47
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?

48
- Whoa, whoa, what book is this?
- Oh.

49
Uh! You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

50
Ooh. It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

51
And, oh! But there's wind.

52
And the wind can make us goddesses.

53
Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

54
Men just take our wind?

55
Uh-huh. All the time.
Because they are the lightning-bearers.

56
- Wow.
Yeah.

57
That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.

58
It is nothing like The Hobbit.

59
It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

60
Except for Richard.

61
Oh, yes. No.
Richard would never steal your wind.

62
- No.
No.

63
- Because he's yummy.
- Yes.

64
But all the other ones.

65
Oh, and the part about how
they're always drinking...

66
...from our pool of inner power.

67
But God forbid we should take a sip.

68
Anybody want a cruller?

69
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

70
Right there. It's like, um...

71
..."Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

72
Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

73
So you're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

74
Joey, look at me.

75
Look at me!

76
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

77
No.

78
Uh, can we get back to me?

79
Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

80
I already got you an audition
for Another World.

81
All right!

82
"Cab Driver Number 2"?

83
You're welcome.

84
But... But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

85
How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

86
Things change. Roll with them.

87
But this is a two-line part!

88
It's like taking a step backwards.

89
I'm not gonna do this.

90
Joey.

91
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

92
...and his pyramid of dogs.

93
Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

94
I'm sorry.

95
I'll see you.

96
Uh, God!

97
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...

98
Isn't it?

99
Uh. This is like reading
about my own life!

100
This book could have been called
Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!

101
It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

102
...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

103
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

104
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.

105
No!

106
No? Heh.

107
No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

108
Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

109
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

110
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

111
You go, girl!

112
I can't pull that off, can I?

113
Excuse me, your wind?

114
Yes, my wind.

115
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

116
You know I don't...

117
...have a problem with that.

118
Okay.

119
I just really need to be
with myself right now.

120
I'm sorry.

121
Mm, mm, mm.
- Uh, you're right.

122
I don't have to apologize.

123
Sorry. Damn it!

124
- What is it?
- I don't know.

125
It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

126
...and some sacred pool.

127
I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

128
This is why I don't date
women who read.

129
Uh-oh.

130
What? What's that?

131
It's my VISA bill.

132
Envelope one of two.

133
- That can't be good.
- Open it, open it.

134
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

135
Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

136
Uh, that's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

137
Aah!

138
Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

139
My animals.

140
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

141
Oh.

142
I don't know what to do!

143
You can start by driving a cab
on Another World.

144
- What?
- That audition?

145
That's a two-line part!

146
Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite. "

147
- So what?
- So suck it up, man.

148
It's a job. It's money.

149
I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

150
- Toilet paper?
- Yeah.

151
I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

152
- You're supposed to be my friend!
- I am your friend.

153
Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine. "

154
And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

155
But I don't know it.

156
What I do know is you owe $2300
at "Isn't It Chromantic?"

157
I'm aware of what I owe.

158
Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

159
- How long till you get another?
- I don't want to hear this!

160
I'm just saying...

161
Well, don't "just say"!

162
Oh. Maybe I should just go.

163
Okay.

164
I'll see you later.

165
Just think about it.

166
I don't need to think about it!

167
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

168
That was huge!

169
Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

170
Ross!

171
You still there?

172
- Hey, pal.
- Oh, God!

173
What are you still doing here?

174
Uh, just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

175
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

176
Aren't you forgetting anything?

177
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

178
He's feistier than the last one.

179
Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

180
Eddie, isn't there something else
you're supposed to be doing now?

181
Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

182
Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

183
I thought we had a deal.

184
- I thought by the time I got...
- Uh, uh.

185
You know what that is?

186
Your last roommate's kidney?

187
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.

188
This one definitely goes in the display.

189
It's in the display.

190
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.

191
Lemonade?

192
You okay, man?

193
Ahh, it's career stuff.

194
They killed off
my character on the show.

195
Oh, that's too bad.
How'd they do it?

196
I fell down an elevator shaft.

197
Oh. That sucks.

198
I was buried in an avalanche.

199
What?

200
I used to be Brice on All My Children.

201
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

202
There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

203
...watching!
- I...

204
Neh.

205
I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

206
I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

207
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

208
- What?
- You! Move out!

209
Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

210
You want me to move out? Uh...

211
Uh-huh.

212
Heh. I, uh...

213
Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind
of out of the blue, don't you think?

214
This is not out of the blue!

215
This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

216
Whoa!

217
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

218
You don't have to tell me twice.

219
God, I mean, someone will be by
for my stuff.

220
If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

221
You want some help?

222
No help required, chico!

223
All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

224
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

225
Excuse me, that's "50" bucks.

226
- What?
- Five-O dollars.

227
Oh. You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

228
When I was on Days ofour Lives
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

229
...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

230
Ha, ha. That's great.

231
If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

232
...I could attend to the victims...

233
...because I have a background
in medical acting.

234
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

235
No. Uh, don't thank me for coming in.
Uh, at least let me finish.

236
Uh, we could take the expressway...

237
...but, uh, this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

238
You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

239
I'll have a good day.

240
Okay, question number 28.

241
"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

242
I would have to say no.

243
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha. "

244
What?

245
Do you not remember the puppet guy?

246
You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

247
And his puppet too!

248
Well, at least I didn't let some guy...

249
...into the forest of my righteous truth
on the first date!

250
- Who?
- Paul!

251
Oh!

252
Okay, okay, moving on, moving on.
Next question.

253
Okay, number 29.

254
"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

255
...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

256
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

257
Not, uh...

258
Ahem. Not to my recollection.

259
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

260
You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

261
Only because you took up
half the circle!

262
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

263
Oh!

264
Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

265
Mm.

266
Not when they find out
you slept with Jason...

267
...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

268
One hour?

269
- You are such a leaf blower!
Oh!

270
Ugh!

271
Ugh.

272
Oh, hey, uh,
be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.

273
Judas is a little loose.

274
Oh, my God! What's going on?

275
They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

276
No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

277
I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

278
No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

279
To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

280
And that's amazing to me.

281
I could never do what you do.

282
- Thanks.
- You hold out for something bigger.

283
I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

284
...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

285
- I went.
- Great! How did it go?

286
- I didn't get it.
- Good for you!

287
You're living the dream!

288
- Huh?
- Ha, ha.

289
All right, then!

290
- Oh, not my parrot.
- What?

291
I can't watch this.

292
Hey, hold on, hold on.

293
How much for the, uh?
How much to save the bird?

294
- Twelve hundred.
- Dollars?

295
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

296
Uh, it was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

297
Go ahead with the bird.

298
- Do you have anything for around $200?
- Uh.

299
The dog.

300
- Huh?
- Yeah.

301
I'll take it.

302
My gift to you, man.

303
Thanks, Ross!

304
I really liked that bird, though.

305
- But the dog! Oh!
- Yeah. Right?

306
Here are your cakes.

307
We didn't order cake.

308
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.

309
You guys, this is not good.

310
We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

311
...without taking it from each other.

312
- You're right.
You know?

313
I love you goddesses.

314
I love you.

315
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

316
Oh.

317
- Thank you. So are we good?
- Oh. We're good.

318
- We're good?
- Yes.

319
Okay. Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

320
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

321
- Are you sure this time?
Yes.

322
I actually saw him leave.

323
That guy is holding a human head.

324
He's holding a human head!

325
Check it out, man!

326
I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.

327
There is no alley behind Macy's.

328
So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

329
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece
at our next cocktail party, huh?

330
"Our next cocktail party"?

331
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

332
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?

333
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

334
Ahem. Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

335
Uh, yes.

336
So, what happened?

337
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

338
Oh, sweet Moses!

339
So on this road trip,
uh, did you win any money?

340
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

341
$300! He buys me these new shoes.
Sweet, huh?

342
Nice.

343
Uh, see you upstairs. See you, pals!

344
Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

345
May I help you?

346
Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

347
I'm sorry. Aah.

348
Have we met?

349
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

350
I'm sorry, I, uh...

351
...I already have a roommate.

352
Hello.

353
Um, he's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

354
No, no. He's, uh...

355
No, he moved out and I moved in.

356
Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

357
I know I would. Ha, ha.

358
That's, uh, a good point. Um...

359
Okay, wow. Huh.

360
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

361
Look, I'm...

362
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Hey, no problem.

363
See you.

364
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

365
- You want me to help you unpack?
- Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh...

366
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

367
I mean, I do have to, but...

368
It's just that that place,
it wasn't really...

369
I mean, this is...

370
Welcome home, man.

371
- A little foos?
- Absolutely!

372
What happened to the foosball?

373
It's a cantaloupe.

374
Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

375
He paid a lot of money for it.

376
- I'm gonna hold him a different way.
- All right.

377
If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

378
Well, I had a whole ceramic-zoo thing
going over there.

379
But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

380
Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

381
Stay.

382
Uh, stay!

383
Good fake dog.

1
Okay, these were expensive,
and he's gonna grow out of them...

2
...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist!

3
Aww!

4
Look at these.

5
Hey, Ben.

6
"Just do it"! Unh!

7
Oh, my God! Oh!

8
Was that too much pressure for him?

9
- Oh, is he hungry already? Aw.
- I guess so.

10
You know, it's...

11
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

12
Oh, uh, I gotta get one too.

13
Hey, what are you guys doing?

14
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

15
Ladle?

16
Will you guys grow up?

17
This is the most natural,
beautiful thing in the world.

18
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

19
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

20
If you have a problem, if you're
uncomfortable, just ask questions.

21
Carol's fine with it. Come on.

22
- Carol?
- Carol.

23
I was wondering if Joey could ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

24
- Sure.
- Uh...

25
Does it hurt?

26
It did at first, but not anymore.

27
Chandler?

28
So, uh, how often can you do it?

29
As much as he needs.

30
Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. Uh...

31
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

32
- Rachel, do you have muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

33
Oh, you're busy, I'll get it.

34
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

35
No, I'm all set.

36
Oh, you're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

37
- Oh.
- There you go.

38
Thank you.

39
Ugh, what a bitch.

40
Listen, guys, I have a friend
at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

41
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

42
So anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

43
I can't. I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

44
- Okay. Um, I'll go with you.
Great.

45
Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

46
- And hello to the rest.
Hi.

47
What are you doing?

48
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

49
- It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
- Come on.

50
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

51
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

52
- But I...
- Monica, she will kill you.

53
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

54
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

55
Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal.
In fact...

56
It's a big deal to me. This is great.
I really appreciate this.

57
You're welcome.

58
Bijan for men?

59
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

60
- Did you hear about the new guy?
- Who?

61
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man. "

62
Hombre?

63
What's he doing in my section?

64
I guess he doesn't know.

65
Well, he's gonna.

66
I'll see you a little later, okay?

67
Hey, how you doing?

68
Morning.

69
Listen, uh, heh. I know you're new...

70
...but, uh, it's kind of
understood that everything...

71
...from young men's to
the escalator is, uh, my territory.

72
- Your territory, huh?
- Yeah.

73
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

74
Hombre?

75
Yeah, all right.

76
You were saying?

77
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

78
- What?
- We were shopping and we had lunch.

79
All right. What did I have?

80
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

81
Hi, guys. What's up?

82
I went shopping with Monica all day
and I had a salad.

83
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

84
Um...

85
We went shopping for, um...

86
For, um...

87
For fur.

88
- You went shopping for fur?
- Yeah.

89
And then I realized
that I'm against that and, um...

90
So then we bought some, um...

91
Um, boobs.

92
You bought boobs?

93
Bras!

94
We bought bras!

95
We bought bras.

96
Bijan for men?

97
Bijan for...

98
Hey, Annabel. Uh...

99
Listen, I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

100
Actually, I sort of have plans.

101
Oh.

102
You ready, Annabel?

103
You bet.

104
- Maybe some other time.
- Yeah.

105
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

106
Bijan for men?

107
Bijan for men!

108
Okay, and this is Funny Clown.

109
Funny Clown is only for after his naps,
not before or he won't sleep.

110
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

111
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

112
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

113
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

114
Oh, this is so cute.

115
Ah, I got that for him!

116
"My Mommies Love Me. "

117
That's clever.

118
Hello?

119
Oh, hi, Jul...

120
Hi, Jew!

121
Uh-huh.

122
Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.

123
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.

124
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

125
Yes. Um, yes, I did.

126
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

127
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

128
Ben, dinner!

129
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

130
You didn't microwave that, did you?
It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.

131
Duh, I think I know
how to heat breast milk. Heh.

132
Okay.

133
What did you just do?

134
I licked my arm, what?

135
It's breast milk!

136
So?

137
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

138
- What is the big deal?
No, no...

139
What did you just do?

140
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

141
- You won't even taste it?
- No.

142
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

143
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

144
- Hey.
- Hi.

145
- Where is everybody?
- Took Ben to the park.

146
- Where have you been?
- Just out.

147
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

148
- Hey, thanks for your jacket.
- Oh, no problem.

149
- You can borrow it, by the way.
- Heh.

150
- Oh, here are your keys, honey.
- Thank you.

151
- Mon?
- Mm-hmm?

152
If, uh, you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

153
You know what probably happened?

154
- Someone must have stolen my credit card.
- Ah.

155
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

156
Huh. That is an excellent,
excellent question.

157
That is excellent.

158
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

159
- Judy.
- Who?

160
- Julie. Jody?
- What?

161
- You were with Julie?
- Mm. Look.

162
When it started,
I was just trying to be nice to her...

163
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

164
And then one thing led to another...

165
...and before I knew it, we were...

166
...shopping.
- Aah.

167
Oh, my God.

168
Wait, we only did it once.

169
It didn't mean anything to me.

170
- Yeah, right. Sure.
- Really!

171
Rachel,
I was thinking of you the whole time.

172
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

173
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

174
That is not true!

175
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

176
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

177
Okay, Monica,
I just have to know one thing.

178
Did you go with her
to Bloomingdale's?

179
Okay. Okay.

180
Okay, I just really, um...
I just need to not be with you right now.

181
Hi, who's this?

182
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

183
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

184
Joanne, it's not as simple
as all that, okay?

185
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

186
- Hey!
Hi!

187
How did we do?

188
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

189
I... I did not freak out.

190
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

191
It's gross!

192
My breast milk is gross?

193
This should be fun.

194
No, Carol.
There's nothing wrong with it.

195
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

196
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

197
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

198
- Come on, just taste it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

199
That would be no.

200
- Come on.
- Try it.

201
- It's natural.
- It doesn't taste bad.

202
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like, uh...

203
- Like what?
- Cantaloupe juice.

204
Exactly.

205
You've tasted it.

206
You've tasted it.

207
Uh-huh.

208
Oh, you've tasted it.

209
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

210
Give me the bottle.

211
Get me the towel.

212
Howdy.

213
Give me a box ofjuice.

214
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

215
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

216
Or maybe this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

217
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

218
What do you care?

219
You're an actor. This is your day job.
Isn't supposed to mean anything.

220
I know, but I was the best.

221
You know? I liked being the best.

222
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

223
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

224
Say you do that.

225
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

226
And then where you gonna run?

227
- I guess you're right.
- Damn right I'm right.

228
Show this guy what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

229
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

230
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

231
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

232
I don't know what to say.

233
That works good
because I'm not listening.

234
I feel terrible. I really do.

235
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

236
Rachel!

237
Say that I'm friends with her.
We spend time together.

238
- Is that so terrible?
- Yes.

239
- It's that terrible?
- Yes, Monica! You don't get it.

240
It's bad enough she stole the guy...

241
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

242
But now...

243
...she's actually...

244
But now she's actually stealing you!

245
Me?

246
What are you talking about?

247
Nobody could steal me from you.

248
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

249
Honey.

250
I mean, you're my...

251
And we're...

252
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

253
You guys, um, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

254
But, um, I love you guys too!

255
Ugh, I really needed that.

256
Look, I know you're in a place
right now...

257
...where you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

258
But she didn't do anything wrong.

259
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

260
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

261
Will you give that a chance?

262
For me?

263
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

264
I'd do anything for you!

265
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

266
Morning.

267
Heh. I said, morning.

268
I heard you.

269
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

270
You boys ready?

271
Ready.

272
Yeah, I'm ready.

273
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

274
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

275
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

276
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

277
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

278
My God, what happened?

279
Eh, these new kids, they never last.

280
Sooner or later they all...

281
...stop lasting.

282
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

283
Sure.

284
- So.
- So.

285
I just thought the two of us
should hang out a bit.

286
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

287
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?

288
- I know.
- Mm.

289
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

290
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

291
Really? Me?

292
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

293
Ross is so crazy about you...

294
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

295
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

296
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

297
Well...

298
...you're not totally paranoid.

299
- Oy.
- Um.

300
Okay. Um...

301
- God. Um...
- Heh.

302
When you and, uh,
Ross first started going out...

303
...it was really hard for me, um...

304
...for many reasons of which I'm not
gonna bore you with now, but, um...

305
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

306
And, um, Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

307
...and God, I hate it when she's right.

308
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

309
Listen. Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

310
- Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
- Yeah?

311
- I'd love it too. Okay.
- Okay.

312
- Oh, shoot, I gotta go.
- Okay.

313
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

314
- Bye.
- Bye.

315
What a manipulative bitch.

316
It's not bad.

1
Hey.

2
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

3
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

4
- What?
- What are you talking about?

5
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

6
Frontier fun!

7
Pheebs, what about the end?

8
Oh, when Yeller saves the family
from the wolf and everyone's happy?

9
That's not the end.

10
Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end. "

11
What about when he has rabies?

12
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

13
That's what my mom said.

14
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

15
Why? What's about to happen?

16
I've never seen this part.

17
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

18
Oh, no.

19
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

20
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

21
No! The end! The end!

22
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

23
Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

24
Chicken and potatoes.

25
What am I wearing?

26
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

27
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

28
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

29
How do you find clothes that fit?

30
Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.

31
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

32
And no, I don't look.

33
No, not that one.

34
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Knicks game.

35
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

36
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

37
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

38
Ha, ha, okay.

39
Why don't you ask Richard?

40
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Knicks game...

41
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

42
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

43
Wow.

44
Being a huge Knicks fan myself...

45
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

46
Okay.

47
That's Eric.

48
Glad to be of help. Matches.

49
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

50
Eh.

51
What?

52
- I don't know.
- Come on!

53
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

54
Richard's really nice.
Uh, we just don't know him really well.

55
Plus, he's old...

56
- er than some people.

57
But, uh, younger than some buildings.

58
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

59
He's important to me.

60
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

61
How do we say yes...

62
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

63
Okay, this could be tough.

64
Okay, okay, okay. Monica?

65
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

66
Ooh, you almost had it.

67
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

68
- Hello, ha, ha.
- Hey.

69
Hi, honey. Oh.

70
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

71
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

72
...and he pulls himself up!

73
He pulled himself up!

74
Standing man!

75
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

76
Uh, we know.
He already did it last week.

77
You can watch our tape if you want.

78
Ah, see, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

79
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

80
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

81
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

82
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

83
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen. "

84
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

85
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

86
Listen. I feel...

87
That would be great.

88
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

89
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

90
Oh, look, did you just see that?

91
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

92
He's never waved before!

93
Yes, he has. Very good.

94
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?

95
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

96
Wow, all you need now
is The Killing Fields...

97
...and some guacamole,
and you got yourself a party!

98
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

99
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

100
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

101
You know, before she killed herself.

102
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

104
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

105
What's the matter with you?
He's parking the car.

106
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

107
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

108
Wow.

109
He must like you best.

110
Oh, what about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

111
You never even saw the money.

112
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

113
Ha, ha, you're welcome.
Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.

114
No problem, ha, ha.

115
- Hey, Chandler...
- I think they get it.

116
There's the man!

117
Hey.

118
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Huh? Ha, ha.

119
I'm gonna keep this.

120
Okay.

121
He kept my dollar.

122
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

123
Ah, we're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

124
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

125
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

126
Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

127
We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

128
Have a good time.

129
Okay, Ben.

130
- Ross.
- Yeah?

131
Look.

132
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

133
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

134
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

135
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

136
Not like him, per se.

137
Just not unlike him.

138
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

139
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

140
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

141
Oh, we flipped for it.

142
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

143
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

144
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

145
I promised Richard
we'd meet downstairs.

146
You're meeting Richard?

147
- Ranger game.
- Didn't he tell you?

148
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

149
You hear that?

150
- We're the guys!
- We're the guys!

151
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

152
Thank you!

153
- Hi, we're visiting.
- Yay.

154
It's Ben and his dada.

155
Dada.

156
- Can you say "dada"?
- Aw.

157
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

158
- No luck, huh?
- No.

159
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

160
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but...

161
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

162
- Oh, yeah, sure, okay.
- There we go.

163
What are you doing?

164
I'm holding Ben.

165
Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.

166
Okay.

167
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

168
This is how I would hold a football.

169
Here. Here. There we go.

170
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

171
- I mean, you know, since I was one.
- Ha, ha.

172
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

173
You'll feel different
when it's our baby.

174
- What?
- What?

175
You think about stuff like that?

176
Uh, yeah. I mean...

177
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

178
Two babies?

179
You know, a boy and a girl.

180
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

181
Then what's gonna happen?

182
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

183
Scar... Uh-huh.

184
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

185
...but close enough
that they can babysit.

186
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

187
...but the school system's great.

188
Wow! Ha, ha.

189
Wow, that's great! Great!

190
- Okay, wow! You know what?
Hmm?

191
I'm off my break now. So, uh...

192
Um, here. You take this.

193
And, um...

194
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

195
Okay.

196
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

197
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

198
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

199
Rach.

200
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

201
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

202
- You watched the movies?
Uh-huh.

203
What is happening to the world?

204
I mean...
No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

205
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

206
Charlotte who?

207
With the web. The spider.

208
She dies. She has babies and dies.

209
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital. " Thud!

210
You wanna feel better?

211
Yeah.
- Okay.

212
Here. Watch this.

213
It's a Wonderful Life.
Yes, I've heard of this.

214
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

215
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

216
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

217
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

218
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

219
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

220
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

221
Hey, big guy. Game time.

222
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

223
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

224
Bring your nerves of steel.

225
It's the basketball playoffs.

226
Um, I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

227
They have each other.

228
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

229
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

230
They don't start sentences with "You
know who just died shoveling snow?"

231
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

232
Go Knicks!

233
- Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Oh.

234
- Then, go Vassar!
- Uh, they're not in it.

235
- Okay, then just go.
- Okay.

236
Ugh, why does this bother me
so much?

237
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

238
Sure.

239
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

240
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

241
- Ugh!
- Me too!

242
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys...

243
Ross made plans for the century.

244
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

245
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

246
Okay.

247
What happened back there?

248
I don't know. You tell me.

249
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

250
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

251
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

252
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

253
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

254
You never think about our future?

255
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

256
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

257
I do not think about
our children's names!

258
You know what our
children's names will be?

259
Ha, ha, no.

260
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

261
And I thought that might be good.

262
What was the book?

263
The Big Book of Children's Names.

264
Okay. Ross, Ross.

265
Okay, listen.

266
What we have is amazing.

267
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

268
I spent my whole life like that.

269
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

270
I like not knowing right now.

271
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

272
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

273
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

274
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

275
He knows we'll end up together.

276
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

277
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

278
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

279
- That's the first time we've said that!
- Yes.

280
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

281
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

283
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

284
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

285
...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

286
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

287
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

288
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

289
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

290
Kick, save! And...

291
...denied!

292
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!

293
Yes!

294
Could that shot be any prettier?

295
Man, you are incredible.

296
We had a table in college.

297
Oh, really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

298
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

299
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

300
One more point.

301
Score!

302
- Now can we go?
- Uh...

303
That's why we don't let her play.

304
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hm.

305
Uh-oh.

306
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

307
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

308
He's just really great
to hang out with.

309
- Well...
No, seriously.

310
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

311
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just...

312
Ow, ow, ow.
What are you kicking me for?

313
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.

314
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

315
- Oh, yeah.
- No!

316
No.

317
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

318
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy. "

319
- We mean "pal. "
- Uh-huh, yeah.

320
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

321
Monica's my dad.

322
I've even got some dads down at work.

323
That's fine.

324
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

325
I'll just see you kids around.

326
Nighty-night.

327
You're not a dad!
- You're not a dad!

328
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

329
So are you okay?

330
Yeah.

331
Just...

332
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

333
I thought I was just one of the guys.

334
Come here.

335
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

336
Mm.

337
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

338
I was killing them.

339
- Yeah, well they suck too.
- Ha, ha.

340
Hmm.

341
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

342
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

343
- Hello.
It's us.

344
Come on up.

345
I'll get his stuff together.

346
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

347
Yes, we can.

348
There! I did it!

349
Ha, ha, I did it!

350
Ooh, look at that!

351
Oh, it stays on and everything.

352
- Hi.
Hi.

353
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

354
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

355
- What?
- Ben just said hi!

356
What, the word "hi"?

357
No, my Uncle Hi.

358
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

359
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

360
- Where is he?
- We missed you.

361
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben, ha, ha.

362
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

363
What did he say?

364
Something about hi.

365
- That's so exciting!
- Mommy's so proud of you!

366
Hi. Hi?

367
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

368
- Hi?
- Hi.

369
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
This could go on for a while.

371
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

372
Well, this was fun.

373
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

374
Okay.

375
- All right, so I've got him?
- Tuesday.

376
Bye, you guys.

377
Take care.
- Bye, Ben.

378
Bye.

379
Did he just say "bye"?

380
He said bye!

381
You said... He said bye to me!

382
- Yes, he did!
- Oh.

383
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

384
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

385
See you later.

386
- Bye.
Bye.

387
- Oh!
- Ha, ha.

388
- Bye.
Bye.

389
Bye.

390
Oh.

391
Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

392
...isn't this a nice hole here?

393
Okay, ahem.

394
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

395
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

396
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

397
But I think we can handle it.

398
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

399
Here we go.

400
Bert? Bert?

401
Bert?

402
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

403
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

404
- Mm.
- I'm so glad you're here.

1
Stocks and bonds are moving higher...

2
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

3
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

4
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

5
But when it does, it's exciting.

6
Hmm, okay, honey,
you really need a job.

7
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

8
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

9
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

10
No, you just said "dad. "
And everywhere I go today...

11
...I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

12
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

13
Which is my father's last name.

14
Ah.

15
And they were serving franks...

16
...which is his first name,
minus the "s" at the end.

17
Yes.
All right.

18
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

19
His Indian name?

20
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

21
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

22
- Very freaky.
- Eerie.

23
Who wants the last hamburger?

24
That's it.
Now I have to go see him, ha, ha.

25
Why?

26
Hamburger? McDonald's?

27
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

28
Ah.

29
Man, I am so beat.

30
Oh, yeah.

31
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

32
Yeah, all right.

33
- Hey, you're in our seats.
- Oh, sorry, we didn't know.

34
Hey, we were sitting there.

35
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

36
- Who knows it? Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

37
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Actually, I was going for colorful.

38
- What's with this guy?
- What's with you?

39
Uh, nothing. Nothing's with him.

40
Enjoy your coffee.

41
What just happened?

42
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

43
My joke is that I took your hat.

44
That is funny.

45
Can I have it back?

46
No.

47
- No?
- No.

48
Okay. Okay.

49
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

50
Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha.

51
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

52
Why should we?

53
Because it's a special hat.

54
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

55
So he got the hat...

56
...to cheer himself up, you know?

57
- Now, Chandler...
- Stop talking. Stop talking now.

58
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

59
You got a problem?

60
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

61
How'd the interview go?

62
It bit.

63
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

64
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

65
I was a sous-chef
at Café des Artistes.

66
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

67
- Don't do it.
- How can I not do it?

68
I have $127 in the bank.

69
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

70
I don't want a beer.

71
Who said it was for you?

72
Hi.

73
What's the matter?

74
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

75
- No.
- You're kidding.

76
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

77
Actual bullies.

78
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

79
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

80
Oh...

81
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.

82
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

83
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

84
- Hey. I went up!
- What?

85
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

86
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

87
...that I'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

88
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

89
- Do what?
- Put all my money in me.

90
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

91
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

92
Yes, Manhattan.

93
Telephone number to the stock...

94
...selling store.

95
See? Didn't I tell you these pillows
would be a good idea?

96
Oh, God.

97
Here we go.

98
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, birth father!"

99
- We love you. We're here for you.
- Good luck.

100
Thanks.

101
Hey, Rach, you, uh,
want some sandwich?

102
Oh, what is in that?

103
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

104
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

105
Hey, hey... No, oh, oh, oh.

106
- Run, Phoebe, run.
- No, no, doggy, please!

107
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

108
- You got a bone?
- Are you kidding?

109
Look, kibbles! Bits, oh!

110
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

111
Ooh.

112
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

113
Why don't you take his trampoline?

114
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

115
Hey. Hey. Hey, no!

116
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich! Aah!

117
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

118
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

119
What does that tell you?

120
- Lf he's not gonna eat it, I will.
- Are you crazy?

121
Pheebs, he's just a little dog. Aah!

122
- Hey.
- What?

123
Do you have to be
a Century 21 real-estate agent...

124
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

125
Do you say this stuff to girls?

126
Hey, isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

127
And look where they're sitting.

128
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

129
- Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
- Yeah.

130
This couch belongs to us.

131
I'll tell you what, you call the couch...

132
...and then we'll call the couch...

133
...and we'll see who it comes to.

134
You know what I keep wondering?
Why you two are still sitting here.

135
All right, that's it.

136
I have had enough of this, all right?

137
Gunther.

138
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

139
Fellas, these guys were here first.

140
- Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
- Ahem.

141
There you go.

142
Thank you, Gunther.

143
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

144
He told on us?

145
You told on us?

146
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

147
- Don't play with his thing.
- I know.

148
All right.

149
Let's take this outside.

150
"Let's take this outside"?

151
Who talks like that?

152
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

153
- You had to ask.
- Yeah.

154
Okay, okay, look. See...

155
...the thing is,
we're not gonna fight you guys.

156
Here's the deal.

157
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

158
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

159
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

160
Yeah, I don't know.

161
What's the matter?

162
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

163
Like the beast at the threshold.

164
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

165
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

166
Despite what she says.

167
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

168
I don't know. This is my real father...

169
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

170
I completely understand.

171
Yeah, whatever you need.

172
Hey, you want to go home?

173
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

174
What was that?

175
Uh, I'm guessing
the threshold's clear now.

176
I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.

177
Come on, time is money, my friend!

178
Thank you! Whoo!

179
"Time is money, my friend"?

180
You missed
"Takes money to make money"...

181
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt. "

182
I made $17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

183
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

184
How did you make $17?

185
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

186
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

187
How come those?

188
Well, CHP because I used to have
a crush on Erik Estrada.

189
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy. "

190
Ahem, what happened to MEG?

191
MEG was good for me,
but I dumped her.

192
My motto is, "Get out before they go down. "

193
That is so not my motto.

194
- Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.

195
- Oh, hey, how's the dog?
- Yeah.

196
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

197
He said the little fella's gonna be okay,
and I can get him tomorrow.

198
Good.
- Oh, thank God.

199
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

200
And he said that only once in a blue moon
does a dog's ear grow back.

201
So still hoping.

202
Now are you gonna call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

203
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

204
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

205
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog. "

206
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

207
Okay.

208
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

209
Don't...

210
...be too long with the phone.

211
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

212
It's a woman.

213
So talk to her.

214
Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.

215
I know where your dog is.

216
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

217
...within 24 hours.

218
Uh, goodbye.

219
- Why the voice?
- Hard to say.

220
Your cappuccino, sir.

221
Thank you.

222
- This is better than the coffeehouse.
- Absolutely.

223
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

224
The package says to keep it moving.

225
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

226
This is ridiculous.

227
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

228
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

229
No problem. Joey's there, hmm?

230
- Okay.
- No.

231
- No?
- No.

232
I don't want to have to have Joey with me
every time I want decent coffee.

233
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k. "

234
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

235
All right, hang on a second there, Custer.

236
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

237
Yeah, sure.

238
- By someone besides Monica?
- No.

239
So what?

240
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

241
Like a rite of passage or something.

242
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

243
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

244
- I need $100.
- What?

245
Hi. Welcome home.

246
- I need $100.
- For what?

247
- To get back in the game.
- When did you get out?

248
- I lost it all, I lost it.
- Oh, no.

249
I've come to terms with it,
you have to too.

250
Okay.

251
Look, uh, Mon, I'm really sorry.

252
Where are we on the $100?

253
I don't have it.

254
But I need it!

255
Otherwise, I'll have to take that diner job.

256
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

257
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

258
Nobody does, honey.

259
Hi.

260
Noodle!

261
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

262
It was an accident.

263
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

264
She's a vegetarian.

265
Are these stitches?

266
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him, ha, ha.

267
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up too long...

268
...because that cone
will fill up fast.

269
Well, uh, thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

270
- Is Frank home?
- How do you know Frank?

271
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

272
Yeah. Frank.

273
Yeah.

274
What?

275
Oh, okay, um, I mean Frank Senior.

276
He went out for groceries.

277
Will he be back soon?

278
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

279
I'm gonna go.

280
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.

281
I'm sorry.

282
Hey, lady!

283
Hey, wait up!

284
- How do you know my dad?
- Um, well, I don't really.

285
Just genetically.

286
He's kind of my dad too.

287
Heavy.

288
Yeah.

289
So, um, did he ever
talk about me? Phoebe?

290
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

291
Oh.

292
Except stilts.

293
- Stilts?
- Yeah, he loved stilts.

294
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

295
...and, uh, all of a sudden
I look over...

296
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

297
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

298
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

299
- Wow.
- Yeah.

300
I don't know what to do with that.

301
- Me neither, ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

302
- So are you, like, my big sister?
- Yeah.

303
This is huge.
You can buy me beer, ha, ha.

304
- I'm not gonna.
- Oh.

305
But you know what's cool?
If you had a friend named Pete, I could say:

306
"I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother. "

307
- I got a friend named Mark.
- That'll work too.

308
Cool. All right.

309
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

310
We could talk or something.

311
- Yeah, that'd be okay.
- All right.

312
I'm in the book.

313
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, all right.

314
So, um, stilts, huh?

315
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

316
Okay.

317
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

318
- How long does coffee take?
- Would you come on? Come on!

319
Thank you.

320
- There we go.
- I think we proved our point.

321
- You burn your mouth?
- Cannot feel my tongue.

322
Bullies! Big bullies!

323
Oh, look who's here. It's the weenies.

324
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

325
That's why we're here.

326
Yes, we're standing our ground.

327
Apparently.

328
- Let's do this already.
Whoa, whoa.

329
You got a weapon?

330
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

331
All right, let's do this.

332
Question: If I don't care about my watch,
can I use it as a weapon?

333
- What do you mean?
- It's sharp, it's metal.

334
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

335
No, you can't use your watch.

336
Okay.

337
- Or your keys.
- Okay.

338
Here's what we'll do.

339
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

340
- All right?
- All right.

341
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

342
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

343
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

344
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

345
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

346
...and, uh, this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

347
Okay, nothing from the neck up.

348
All right.

349
Or the waist down.

350
- Dana's ovulating.
- Oh, really? You guys trying again?

351
Yeah.

352
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

353
- Come on!
- Hey, hey, whoa!

354
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

355
- Huh!
Hey, hey.

356
Those guys are taking our stuff!

357
Hey, hey!

358
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

359
- You guys kicked butt!
- Us? What about you guys?

360
You really, bing, gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

361
- He was a big guy.
- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

362
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

363
Oh, don't do that to yourself.

364
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

365
So listen, guys, are we, uh?

366
Are we okay here?

367
- We're okay.
- Ha, ha, all right.

368
Okay, so can I have my hat back?

369
No.

370
Huh.

371
Oh, my God. Look at her.

372
Hi, Monica!

373
Ha-ha-ha, how's it going?

374
Hey, nice boobs.

375
Guys, guys. Check this out.

376
Young man

377
I said, young man
Pick yourself off the ground

378
I said, young man

379
Excellent.

380
To be unhappy

381
It's fun to stay at the YMCA

1
So I'll get candles
and my mom's lace tablecloth.

2
Since it's Rachel's birthday
and we want it to be special...

3
...I thought I'd poach a salmon.
Oh.

4
What?

5
Question: Why do we always have to
have parties where you poach things?

6
You wanna be in charge
of the food committee?

7
Question two: Why do we always
have parties with committees?

8
Yeah, yeah.
Why can't we just get some pizzas...

9
...and gets some beers and have fun?
- Yeah.

10
Yeah, I agree. You know,
I think fancy parties are only fun...

11
...if you're fancy on the inside,
and I'm just not sure we are.

12
All right.
You guys don't want it to be special?

13
Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

14
- Joey, they're not real.
- Huh? Huh.

15
I start miles beneath the surface
of these things, okay? They're fake.

16
See? Honk, honk.

17
Wow, it's like porno for clowns.

18
I talked to Rachel's sisters.
Neither of them can come.

19
Okay, so I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

20
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, no Shannon Cooper.

21
Why not her?

22
Because she, uh... She steals stuff.

23
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff...

24
...and Joey slept with her
and never called her back.

25
- Joey, that is horrible.
- Hey, I liked her.

26
All right? Maybe too much. I don't know.

27
I guess I just got scared.

28
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

29
Heh. I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay.

30
- Hi, honey. How did it go?
- Ugh. It was the graduation from hell.

31
You know, my cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

32
You know, I mean, this is supposed to be
a joyous occasion.

33
My sister's graduating from college.
Nobody thought she would.

34
It's a true testament to what a girl
from Long Island would do for a Celica.

35
- So, what happened?
- My parents happened.

36
All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile proudly...

37
...and not talk about the divorce. But no.

38
They got into a huge fight in the middle
of the commencement address.

39
Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

40
Ugh. But you know what?
You know what the good news is?

41
I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

42
Okay, so I guess
we don't invite her parents.

43
- Well, how about just her mom?
- Why her mom?

44
Because I already invited her.

45
Ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

46
Uh, can't invite her.

47
She also steals.

48
Okay, here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

49
Okay, we're not having birthday cake.
We're having birthday flan.

50
Excuse me?

51
It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

52
Whoa, that's nice.

53
Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo.

54
Dr. Green.

55
Oh, my God. It's Rachel's dad.

56
What are you doing here?

57
What, the father can't drop by to see
the daughter on her birthday?

58
No, no, the father can.

59
But, um, since I am the roommate,
I can tell you that she's not here.

60
And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

61
Oh. You're having a party.

62
No, no, not a party.

63
Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

64
- Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
- I'll never remember all of that.

65
So, uh, what's the deal?

66
Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

67
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

68
Hi, Monica.

69
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

70
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

71
Hey, Dr. Green, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

72
All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

73
Well, my goodness. What was that?

74
Sandra, I am so sorry.
I thought you were Rachel.

75
And we weren't ready for you yet.

76
- You thought I was Rachel?
- Yes, because, uh, you look so young.

77
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

78
Oh, I missed you kids.

79
Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

80
No.

81
- No, I'll take that for you.
- Oh, well, thank you.

82
- Okay.
- Such a gentleman. Thank you.

83
Oh.

84
Oh, it all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

85
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

86
- I was driving...
- That's great. Ha-ha-ha.

87
I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

88
So... Hey, come with me.

89
- What?
- Yeah, yeah. It will be like we're gal pals.

90
You know, like at a restaurant.
Oh, it'll be fun. Come on.

91
Ha, ha. Come on.

92
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay, think. Think.

93
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

94
Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed...

95
Okay. We can come back out
in the living room. Ha, ha.

96
So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time
that you take Dr. Green over to your place.

97
Uh, yes, absolutely.

98
Um, why, again?

99
Because that's where
the party is, you goon.

100
See, this is just the staging area.

101
- Right, it's the staging area.
- This is the staging area.

102
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

103
All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

104
And you...
You are off to party number two.

105
All right, fellas, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

106
Chandler, could you at least
send some women to my party.

107
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

108
Okay, they're coming. Shh!

109
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

110
Thanks for being born.

111
Oh, thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

112
- Aw.
- I love you.

113
Oh. Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

114
Hmm. Now I love you even more.

115
Surprise!

116
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

117
Oh, Monica. Oh, my God. Mom.

118
This is so great.

119
Happy birthday, sweetie.

120
Wow. You. I had no idea.

121
- Really?
- No, I knew.

122
All right.

123
Everybody, there's food and drinks
on the table.

124
- Go across the hall.
What?

125
Right now, Joey and Chandler's. Go.

126
- Why?
- Just go.

127
- Weird.
Surprise!

128
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

129
Daddy! Ha, ha.

130
Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

131
Well, we could count again?

132
- I can't believe this is happening.
- You know what? This is ridiculous.

133
Okay, this is your birthday,
this is your party.

134
I say we just put them all together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

135
- I do.
- That's who.

136
Look, are you gonna be okay?

137
Well, I have to be.
I don't really have a choice.

138
I mean, I can look at the bright side.

139
I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

140
Well, actually just one birthday flan.

141
- What?
- It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

142
Look, talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

143
Joe, Joe, hey, some girl just walked up
to me and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

144
...and stuck her tongue down my throat.

145
I love this party.

146
- Quick volleyball question.
- Volleyball.

147
Yeah, we set up a court in your room.

148
Uh, you didn't like that gray lamp,
did you?

149
Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue
down my throat.

150
I'm not even listening to you.

151
Dennis.
- Okay, that's me.

152
Listen, ahem, honey,
can you keep Dad occupied?

153
I'm gonna go talk to Mom for a while.

154
Okay, do you have any ideas
for any openers?

155
Uh, let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

156
...and you should be okay.

157
Okay, people, I want you
to take a piece of paper...

158
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

159
And I do ask that when
you're not using the markers...

160
...you put the caps back on them...

161
...because they will dry out.

162
Hi, Dr. Green.

163
So how's everything in the, uh...

164
...vascular surgery game?

165
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

166
I'm sorry.

167
See, that's the good thing about my job.

168
All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

169
Listen, you guys, um,
I don't mean to be a pain about this...

170
...but, um, I've noticed that some of you
are just placing them on.

171
You want to push the caps...

172
...until you hear them click.

173
Gunther. Where you going?

174
I, uh, was sort of thinking
about maybe...

175
No. No, you can't go. No, this is fun.

176
Come on, come on, we're just
getting started. Here's your marker.

177
Listen, if you want to go, just go.

178
No. She'll yell at me again.

179
All right, ahem, I can get you out.

180
What?

181
Shh.

182
In a minute,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

183
When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

184
- I think I need a drink.
- Oh, I'll get it for you.

185
- What do you want?
- Scotch.

186
All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds
with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.

187
Neat.

188
- Cool.
No, no, no.

189
Neat, as in no rocks.

190
Heh. I know.

191
Oh, hello, Ross.
Now, where have you been?

192
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.

193
Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

194
Oh. Scotch neat.

195
You know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

196
Oh. Huh.

197
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

198
Scotch neat.

199
Would you excuse me?

200
Hey. Hey.

201
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
Heh.

202
I'm getting my cigarettes
out of my jacket.

203
- No.
- No. What do you mean "no"?

204
No, um, see,
because that's the staging area.

205
You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

206
Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch
back in there...

207
...and I will get your cigarettes
for you, sir.

208
- And get my glasses too.
- All righty-roo.

209
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

210
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is:

211
"Monica, your party sucks. "

212
All right. Very funny.

213
Oh, no. Ooh.
Did someone forget to use a coaster?

214
What?

215
I don't see anything.

216
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

217
Ross, whose glasses are those?

218
Mine.

219
You wear bifocals?

220
Mm-hm.

221
I have a condition apparently...

222
...that I require...

223
...two different sets of focals.

224
Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

225
- Oh.
- Well, those are very popular frames.

226
Neil Sedaka wears them.

227
I hear you can get people out of here.

228
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

229
You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

230
Yeah, like a chimney.

231
Big smoker.

232
Big, big smoker.

233
In fact, I'm gonna go out into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

234
Are you wearing my glasses?

235
Yes.

236
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

237
Thank you.

238
Is that one of my cigarettes?

239
Yeah.

240
Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.

241
Okay, okay. She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

242
But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

243
What about my friend Victor?

244
No, only the three of you. Any more
than that and she'll get suspicious.

245
- All right. Let me just get my coat.
- There isn't time.

246
Just leave everything.

247
They'll take care of you next door.

248
Is it true they have beer?

249
Everything you've heard is true.

250
Could you guys please
try and keep it down?

251
We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

252
You. And you.

253
You're supposed to be at my party.
And Gunther.

254
What are you doing here?

255
Um...

256
Hey, welcome to the fo...

257
Phoebe?

258
All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

259
You know, they work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

260
They deserve to have a little fun. Go.

261
You know, my party is fun.

262
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

263
But, you know, if people
would just give it a chance, it's...

264
- You want me to see a therapist?
- Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

265
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

266
Okay, Mom, you know what? Fine.
I'll make an appointment.

267
Okay? But you know what?
Right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.

268
Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

269
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

270
Daddy, Daddy,
I really want to hear more about this...

271
...I really do,
but I just have to do, uh, some stuff.

272
You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

273
...but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

274
You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

275
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

276
And you sand it and you varnish it.

277
But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

278
One night of her yoga
and her Bridges of Madison County...

279
Scotch, cigarettes...
Bonsais, the Chihuahua...

280
I've only been
in therapy three weeks now but...

281
What the hell
does she want with half a boat?

282
Okay, okay, okay,
you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

283
I'll be skins.

284
Hey.

285
How you holding up there, tiger?

286
Oh. Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers. "

287
Ahem. I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports. "

288
Ahem. I even got a "governor. "

289
This is it, isn't it?
I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

290
My mom there, my dad there.

291
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

292
She gets the house, he's in some condo
my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

293
Chandler, how did you get through this?

294
Well, I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

295
...of denial...

296
...and wetting the bed.

297
You know, I just... It's so weird.

298
I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

299
All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

300
Because it reminded you of the way...

301
...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

302
It's just this thing.

303
Every year we would go out
on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.

304
Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

305
My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

306
...and my dad would be upset
because nobody was helping.

307
And then when we did help,
he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

308
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

309
You know, and it'd get really cold.

310
And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

311
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

312
And now it's...

313
Yeah, I know.

314
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.

315
All right, Monica, dear,
I'm gonna hit the road.

316
Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

317
Yes, and you be sure and send me
that finished poem.

318
- Okay, will do. So glad you came.
- All right, dear.

319
- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
- Okay, let me go check.

320
Oh, all right.

321
- Your mom wants to say goodbye.
- Oh, okay.

322
Happy birthday, sweetie.

323
Okay.

324
Uh, you drive safe.

325
Okay.
- What are you doing?

326
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.

327
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on.

328
How are you?

329
- Dr. Green. Where are you going?
- To get my coat.

330
No, no, no.
We'll get that for you.

331
All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

332
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

333
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

334
This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

335
Ha, ha. You know, just get out.

336
Or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.

337
I have to be heading toward my chateau.
Thank you.

338
All right, well, then I guess
we're going back into the hallway again.

339
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Green.

340
Okay.

341
You take care.

342
Oh, you kids.

343
Well.

344
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

345
Thank you.

346
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan.

347
Yep. Get ready for the gelatinous fun.

348
Kind of looks like that stuff you get
when you get a bad infection.

349
Okay, that's enough.

350
Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.

351
Okay, I've got one.

352
Heads up.

353
Wow. Those things almost never come true.

1
Okay, Chandler, Mon,
there's only one banana-nut muffin left.

2
I ordered mine first.

3
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

4
Give it to me.

5
No.

6
Give it to me.

7
Okay, you can have it.

8
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

9
That was there when I got here.

10
Hey, you guys, you will never guess
who's coming to New York.

11
Quick, Phoebe,
tell us before he swallows.

12
Ryan, that guy I went out with
who's in the Navy.

13
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

14
Yeah, I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

15
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

16
Hey, is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

17
No. Heh.

18
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces, like, every couple years...

19
...and we have the most amazing
three days together.

20
Only this time, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yay. "

21
So wait, this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

22
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

23
Hi.

24
Oh, no. What happened?

25
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chicken pox.

26
Oh, no. You're kidding.

27
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you're gonna get it.

28
- Well, I've had it.
- Yeah, I've had it.

29
- Had it.
- Had it.

30
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look.

31
Honey, you made the bed again.

32
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

33
Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

34
Okay, I am going to take a shower.

35
And today I will be singing
Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown. "

36
Monica?

37
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

38
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

39
...or the fattest man
in the whole damn town?

40
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown. "

41
What are you doing?

42
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

43
Are you remaking the bed?

44
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what?
The way you did it, it was just fine.

45
Then you're redoing it because?

46
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

47
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

48
Okay. You see...

49
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

50
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

51
- Uh-huh. Well, that's not so crazy.
- I'm just easing you in.

52
Ha. All right.

53
All right, you see these
little flower blossoms?

54
They should be facing up, not down...

55
...because, well, the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

56
You don't love me anymore, do you?

57
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

58
Really?

59
Wow. Well, then, come on.

60
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

61
Joey, if you need something
to hold you over...

62
...I can get you a job right here
as an entry-level processor.

63
Don't you need experience
for a job like that?

64
It's not that hard to learn.

65
And as for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.

66
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

67
Hey, Chandler.
Here's this morning's projections.

68
Hey, thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

69
- Hey
Hey.

70
Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.

71
No kidding?

72
Oh, yeah.

73
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

74
- Where do you work?
- Uh, well, right now I'm in between things.

75
You know how it is. One day
you're processing, the next day...

76
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

77
I was telling Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

78
Fleischman's group.

79
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

80
Are all you processors dorks?

81
Ugh. This lipstick looks
just great on you.

82
You look fabulous, honey. You really do.

83
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

84
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

85
I'm hideous.

86
It's gonna be okay.

87
Ryan's been underwater.

88
He's just gonna be so glad
that you don't have barnacles on your butt.

89
Come in.

90
Hey, baby, I'm back...

91
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

92
What's going on?

93
No, no. You have to stay back.
I have the pox.

94
Chicken or small?

95
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

96
- Why aren't you at home in bed?
- My grandmother's never had chicken pox.

97
Please, please, tell me you have...

98
...because oh, my God,
I forgot how cute you are.

99
- I'm sorry, I never had them.
- Oh, oh!

100
If I had one wish, it'd be to build
a time machine, go back to when I was 7...

101
...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...

102
...I would grab that kid
and rub him all over my face.

103
Yeah, or, you know, you could
just wish that I didn't have them now.

104
Can I please see your face?

105
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

106
Your face could be covered with lox,
I wouldn't care.

107
And you hate fish. Oh.

108
So sweet. All right.

109
Okay, all right. You can see.

110
This, ahem, is me.

111
Sorry.

112
I am scary.

113
Sorry, the lightning...

114
Lightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

115
You look lovely. Lovely.

116
I hate this.

117
I tell you, I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

118
And almost everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

119
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

120
...thinking about this moment.

121
I am not gonna let a bunch...

122
...of itchy spots stand between us.

123
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

124
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the first day going?

125
Pretty good. It's like you said.

126
It's mostly just putting numbers
from one column into another column.

127
Well, there you go.

128
Hey, and everybody's so nice.

129
I just had a good talk with that lady
with the red hair, Jeannie.

130
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast Operations, Jeannie?

131
Yeah. Turns out our kids
go to the same school.

132
Yeah. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.

133
Weird world.

134
- Your kids?
- I figure my character has kids.

135
You know, there isn't a part of that
sentence that I don't need explained.

136
Well, see, when you're acting,
you need to think about stuff like that.

137
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

138
...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

139
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

140
Oh. Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

141
Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife,
Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.

142
You know what?

143
Just did.

144
Really, wow. That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

145
You know what makes the itching
even worse?

146
That you don't stop talking about it?

147
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?

148
Good, okay.

149
Here we go, double sixes.

150
Here we go...

151
Here we go.

152
Come to Mama.
Just getting ready to roll the dice.

153
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

154
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

155
You're scratching.

156
- Give me the dice.
- No.

157
- Give me the dice.
- No. Here. There.

158
Look, double sixes.

159
We can't scratch. You know we can't.
We'll scar.

160
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

161
I just wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

162
- No. No.
- Give it.

163
Come on.

164
You know you want it.
You know you want it too. Come on.

165
Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.

166
Oh, come on. Come on.

167
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, God, help me.

168
- Uh-huh. Good, huh?
- Yeah.

169
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, good. Now do me.

170
Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder.

171
There you go.

172
- Don't move.
- Why?

173
- Don't move.
- What are you?

174
Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.

175
You know, I might've expected this
of you, Phoebe.

176
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

177
You and Milton
have to join us on the boat.

178
Karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids.
We'll make a day of it.

179
Oh, that sounds lovely.
We're gonna have to set that up.

180
Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

181
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

182
- Bye-bye, Jeannie. Ha, ha.
Bye-bye, Joseph.

183
What a phony.

184
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson
when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

185
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.

186
Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.

187
So we're not gonna see
the report until next Friday?

188
Well, the people in my group
want to spend the holiday with family.

189
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

190
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

191
It's about cutting my people
a little slack, you know, for morale.

192
If you wanna see some rough numbers,
I can get them to you by Wednesday.

193
Rough numbers?

194
This company was not built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

195
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

196
If you say so, sir.

197
Joseph's good, isn't he?

198
Well, I'm going to kill you.

199
Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

200
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

201
Why?

202
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

203
Okay? If you try to pull something...

204
...he'll call you on it.

205
"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.

206
Ooh. Duct tape.

207
Was I supposed to bring something too?

208
This is for the scratchy twins out there.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

209
You're strict.

210
Yeah, well, it's for their own good.

211
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

212
See, in a tape emergency, you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

213
Exactly. Oh.

214
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

215
- Tell me the truth.
- Hmm.

216
Don't you like it better that everything
on your desk is perpendicular?

217
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

218
- Very good.
- Thank you.

219
You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

220
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

221
I'm gonna set them to my time.

222
Well, I'm confused.

223
I thought we shared time.

224
No, no. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

225
You wanna know why?

226
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

227
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, come on, come on, tell me.

228
- No, you don't understand.
- No, come on.

229
No, you don't have any of these
cute obsessive things.

230
No, that's not true. That is not true.

231
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

232
All right, well, tell me one of yours.

233
Okay.

234
Ah.

235
One of my things is,
I always separate my sweat socks...

236
...from my dress socks.

237
- Yeah.
- What if they get mixed up?

238
Boy, I would just, uh...

239
I would freak out.

240
You would not.

241
I can't believe this. I hate this.
You're too normal.

242
I can't believe my boyfriend
doesn't have a thing.

243
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

244
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well there.

245
Hey.

246
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

247
Because he has a strong suspicion that
you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

248
Why? Why does he suspect that?

249
Because at first,
he thought it was Joseph...

250
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

251
- Anyway, I just thought you should know.
- All right. That's it.

252
Look, Joey...

253
...I'm sorry, I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

254
...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.

255
But unfortunately that's not possible.

256
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

257
What are you talking about?
Everybody loves Joseph.

258
I don't. I hate Joseph.

259
Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

260
Oh, yeah?

261
Well, you can't fire Joseph.
You know why?

262
He's not in your department.

263
All right, okay.
All right, so I can't fire Joseph...

264
...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.

265
- Not Karen.
- Yeah, Karen.

266
I'm thinking about having an affair
with her. Oh, you know what?

267
I just did.

268
What the hell are you doing to me, man?

269
Oh, it's not me.

270
It's my character.

271
Chandie.

272
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives for sport...

273
...and then laughs about it the next day.

274
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer.

275
- Really?
- No, freak show, she's fictional!

276
Come on! Hey. Take it easy.

277
If it means that much to you,
I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.

278
Thank you.

279
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

280
I liked him. His wife.

281
She was hot.

282
Ow.

283
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

284
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

285
Well, that wasn't easy.

286
Okay, dinner's on.

287
And there's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

288
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

289
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

290
- Bye.
Oh, look, look.

291
A low-budget puppet show.

292
It's such a shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

293
All right.

294
- Wine?
- Please.

295
- Oh. Spilled some.
- I got it.

296
I must tell you,
you look beautiful tonight.

297
What?

298
Sorry.

299
You look beautiful.

300
Oh.

301
You know what? That's it. That's it.

302
Oh! Oh!

303
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

304
Good.

305
You guys, did you...?

306
Monica, wake up.

307
- Monica.
- What's up?

308
I thought of a thing.

309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

311
No, honey. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

312
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

313
Or so I would have you believe.

314
No. Big deal. So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

315
Hey, come on.
You haven't heard my reason yet.

316
- All right, go on.
- Okay.

317
I have to sleep on the west side...

318
...because I grew up in California...

319
...and otherwise...

320
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

321
- Oh, my God. You're a freak.
- Yeah.

322
How about that?

323
- So, Ryan, where are you shipping off to?
- I really can't say.

324
So do you have any
nuclear weapons onboard?

325
I can't say.

326
Well, do you get to look through
one of those periscope thingies?

327
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

328
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

329
I better get out of here.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

330
Okay, I'll walk you out.

331
Bye, Ryan.
- Pleasure. Take care.

332
So do you, uh, think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

333
You like that, do you?

334
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll make some calls.

335
Okay.

336
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

337
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

338
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.

339
Oh, I just got that.

340
Taxi.

341
Bye, you.

342
I'm sorry, we're clo...

343
Hey, sailor.

344
Is this what you had in mind?

345
Ha, ha. I'll say.

346
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

347
Well, then, uh...

348
...we better make this night count.

349
Oh, wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

350
Anchors aweigh.

351
Oh, wait. My purse, my purse, my purse.

352
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

353
All right,
why don't I just meet you upstairs?

354
Honey.

1
How did the audition go?
- Incredible.

2
I met the director.
You'll never believe who it was.

3
Who?

4
I'll give you one hint.

5
Warren Beatty.

6
Wow.

7
There's just one thing
that might be a problem.

8
See, I had to kiss this guy.

9
Because he was just so darn cute?

10
No, part of the audition.
I'm up for the part of this guy...

11
...who the main guy kisses.

12
Well, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

13
Or you just do it.

14
I did do it.
I'm a professional.

15
- What's the problem?
After the scene...

16
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and
he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser. "

17
Can you believe that?
Me, not a good kisser.

18
That's like...

19
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother. Pfft.

20
Who cares what that guy thinks?

21
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing? Heh.

22
Oh. Heh, heh.

23
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

24
What did your agent say?

25
Yep. This kiss thing is
definitely a problem.

26
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again
on Monday.

27
Man, I gotta figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

28
Oh, okay. One of you girls
come over here and kiss me.

29
- Forget it.
- Yeah, right.

30
Hey, come on.
I need your help here.

31
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

32
See this, huh? This is a friend.

33
Uh-huh. Let's go.

34
Oh, wait. I have gum.

35
Okay.

36
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

37
I'd recommend you to a friend.

38
Then I don't know
what the problem is.

39
Maybe you're not used
to kissing men.

40
Maybe you tensed up a little.

41
Maybe you need to work on it.

42
Yeah, that makes sense.

43
Over my dead body.

44
And I'll be using
his dead body as a shield.

45
Come out, honey.
I'm telling you, you look good.

46
Tell her she looks good.
Tell her she looks good.

47
Oh, my God! Ha, ha, ha.

48
You look so good!

49
I cannot believe I have to walk down
the aisle in front of 200 people...

50
...looking like something
you drink when you're nauseous.

51
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go to this thing.

52
It's your ex-fiancé's wedding.

53
Because I promised Mindy I would.

54
Yeah, well, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

55
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

56
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these people...

57
...and feel good about myself.

58
Someone's wearing the same clothes
they had on last night. Get a little action?

59
I may have.

60
Whoo-hoo! Stud!

61
- What's she look like?
We haven't met.

62
We stayed up all night talking
on the Internet.

63
Whoo-hoo! Geek!

64
I like this girl.
I seriously like this girl.

65
You know how I tend to get
a little defended and quippy?

66
- Get out.
- No. Please.

67
Well, she called me on it, okay?
She said, "Cut it out, get real. "

68
And I did.

69
Wow.

70
What's that like?

71
It's like this. Me.

72
No jokes.

73
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

74
Yeah. I don't like you this way.

75
I'll see you guys later.

76
Bye, Richard.
- Bye-bye.

77
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

78
I love you too.

79
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

80
I wonder what
our wedding will be like.

81
What are you talking about?
What wedding?

82
Come on. You never talk about that?

83
No, never.

84
We're just living in the moment.

85
It is so nice for once not to get
hung up on, "Where is this going?"

86
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

87
I think you should
seriously consider marriage.

88
Give Rachel another chance to dress
like Princess Bubble Yum.

89
Where's Benny?

90
There he is!

91
Where's Benny?

92
There he is!

93
That's probably why babies learn to talk,
so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

94
Hey, I got a question for you.

95
Just a little thing, no pressure.

96
Okay.

97
Do you ever, uh, think about the future?

98
Sure, I do.

99
Yeah? Am I in it?

100
Honey...

101
...you are it.

102
Oh, God.
You're about to get so lucky.

103
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

104
- Keep talking.
- Well...

105
...sometimes I think about
selling my practice.

106
We could move to France.

107
- Make French toast.
- Ooh.

108
Okay, so...

109
...we're in France...

110
...and we're making the toast.

111
Do you see a little bassinet
in the corner?

112
Like a hound?

113
Not a basset.

114
A bassinet.

115
You really need the bassinet?

116
Well, I just think the baby
would keep falling off the dog.

117
- Do you not see kids in our future?
- Oh. Heh.

118
I love children.

119
I have children.

120
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go off to college...

121
...and our life can finally start.

122
- Hm.
- Look.

123
I want you...

124
...now.

125
Well, that's great.
We don't need to talk about this now.

126
Really, I mean this is so, like,
way, way, way in the future.

127
I'm talking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the planet. Heh, heh.

128
Come on, Chandler.
I want this part so much.

129
Just one kiss.
I won't tell anyone.

130
Joey, no means no.

131
Hey.

132
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

133
Aw, Rach, I think you look cute.

134
And you. You...

135
- You, I could eat you with a spoon.
- Get away from me. I said no.

136
Richard buzzed. He's downstairs.

137
Richard's here?
I should run down, say goodbye to him.

138
Bye.
Good luck.

139
How's your date
with your cyber-chick going?

140
Hey, what is all that?

141
It's a web site.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

142
She likes art...

143
...and I like funny words.

144
What does she mean by "H.H."?

145
It means we're holding hands.

146
Are you the cutest?

147
I'm afraid I might just be.

148
I think it's so great
that you're totally into this person...

149
...yet for all you know, she could be
90 years old or have two heads.

150
It could be a guy.

151
It's not a guy, all right?
I know her.

152
It could be like a big, giant guy.

153
Man, I got this close to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

154
What's going on?

155
We're wondering if
Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

156
Ask her how long she's gonna live.

157
Women live longer than men.

158
How do you not fall down more?

159
Okay, ask her what is her method
of birth control.

160
All right.

161
"My husband is sleeping
with his secretary. "

162
She's married?

163
At least we know she's a woman.

164
I can't believe she's married.

165
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

166
This must be really tough for you.

167
I read this article that says
you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...

168
...because when pigeons eat rice,
it kills them.

169
That's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

170
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

171
I'm not even thinking about that thing
that we're not gonna think about.

172
Neither am I.

173
Hey, there.
Are you all right?

174
Yeah. But in the bathroom, I saw
the window I crawled out of at my wedding.

175
And, God, I just started thinking
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

176
People are gonna be looking at me and
judging me and thinking about the last time.

177
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
It's a wedding.

178
Generally, people focus on the bride.

179
I know, you're right.

180
Alrighty.
Everybody look at me. Good.

181
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

182
...let's see two lines.
Thank you.

183
I'll see you after the thing.

184
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you. Okay.

185
Okay.

186
Ah.

187
Why didn't you tell me?

188
What could I do?

189
Stand up and shout,
"Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"

190
Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.

191
The only thing that tops that
was when I was in eighth grade...

192
...and I had to sing the "Copacabana"
in front of the entire school.

193
Two lines into it, I ran and freaked out.

194
Oh, my God. My entire life's flashing
before my eyes.

195
Rach, look, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

196
Ross, would you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

197
Rachel.

198
Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.

199
It's wonderful
to see you again, my dear.

200
In fact, I hardly expected
to see so much.

201
- You told me you didn't see anything.
- I tell you a lot of things.

202
Well, it's wonderful to have you
up and about again, dear.

203
Stay well.

204
That's the third time someone has
said something like that to me today.

205
- Rach!
Hi.

206
- Oh, my God, I'm married!
- I know!

207
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,
hyphen, Farber.

208
I am so proud of you, Min.

209
Min.

210
Oh, Rach. Still here.

211
At our wedding, they were packing up
the chopped liver about now.

212
Yeah, I love that story.

213
Ahem. I have a question for you guys.

214
Why do people keep saying
it's good to see me up and about?

215
After you ran out on your wedding...

216
...Barry's parents told people
you were sort of...

217
...insane.

218
- Insane?
- From the syphilis.

219
What?

220
What were they gonna say?
You didn't love me anymore? Come on.

221
Angela?

222
Joey Tribbiani.

223
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

224
I know you're seeing that guy.
I was thinking maybe you could bring him...

225
Hello? Hello?

226
You gonna answer her? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

227
- She wants to know what's wrong.
- What's wrong? You're married!

228
That's what's wrong!

229
Oh, my.

230
- What?
- She wants to meet you in person.

231
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her in person too.

232
But she's married.
She has a husband.

233
What if the husband is the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

234
You don't get chances like this
all the time.

235
If you don't meet her, you'll
kick yourself when you're 80...

236
...which is hard to do
and that's how you break a hip.

237
Okay. I'll do it.

238
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

239
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because ew!

240
And I'll get the...

241
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

242
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

243
Tall and tan, and young and lovely

244
Okay, one more, please.
I'm gonna get it in this time.

245
Okay, last chance.

246
Again, I'm sorry.

247
You know what, maybe I don't
need to have children.

248
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

249
...and by that I mean my mom...

250
...has always convinced me that I...

251
But I want her so badly

252
I do.

253
I have to have children.
I'm sorry, I just do.

254
Yo, could I have your attention?

255
Best man making a toast here.

256
Thank you. Ahem.

257
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with Rachel.

258
Huh?

259
What? You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

260
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

261
Anyway, I wish you both...

262
...a wonderful life together.
Aw.

263
And, Rachel.

264
- What?
- No, no, in all seriousness.

265
Not a lot of women would
have the guts to come back here.

266
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

267
That's it.

268
I'd like to add something to that.

269
- What are you adding? What are you adding?
- It's okay. It's okay.

270
Most of you don't know me.
I'm Rachel's boyfriend...

271
Oh, dear God.

272
...Ross.

273
And I'd just like to say that...

274
...it did take a lot of courage
for Rachel to come here tonight.

275
And just for the record...

276
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphilis.

277
What are you doing? I'm serious.

278
The reason...

279
...she walked out on Barry
is simply that...

280
...she didn't love him.

281
Which, incidentally,
worked out pretty well for me. Heh, heh.

282
Cheers.

283
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach.

284
And once again,
she is out of here!

285
Okay, who had 9:45? Hm?

286
Heh.

287
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna leave.

288
I probably should, but I'm not.

289
I promised myself I'd make it
through at least one of your weddings.

290
Tonight, all I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

291
...with a little bit of grace
and dignity.

292
Well, I guess we can all agree
that's not gonna happen.

293
I guess there's nothing
really left to say...

294
...except...

295
Her name was Lola

296
She was a showgirl

297
With yellow feath...

298
Feathers in her hair

299
And a dress cut down to there

300
She would...

301
Merengue
- Merengue

302
Thank you, honey.

303
And do the cha-cha

304
And while she'd like to be a star
Tony always tended bar

305
Wait, wait!

306
Everybody!

307
Copa

308
Copacabana

309
The hottest spot north of Havana

310
At the Copa

311
Copacabana

312
Music and passion were always
In fashion at the Copa

313
There's a somebody I'm longing...

314
Okay.

315
I'll do it.

316
You'll do what?

317
If kids is what it takes to be with you,
then kids it is.

318
Oh, my God.

319
If I have to,
I'll do it all again.

320
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

321
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

322
I'll coach the soccer team.

323
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

324
Monica...

325
...I don't wanna lose you.

326
So if I have to do it all again...

327
...then I will.

328
You are the most wonderful man.

329
And if you hadn't have said...

330
..."If I have to," like, 17 times...

331
...then I'd be saying, "Okay, let's do it. "

332
But you're not.

333
Oh, my God. I can't believe
what I'm getting ready to say.

334
I wanna have a baby.

335
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't really want to have one.

336
God.

337
I love you.

338
I know you do.

339
Me too.

340
So what now?

341
I guess we just...

342
...keep dancing.

343
Someone to watch

344
Over me

345
Where is she? Where is she?

346
Oh, hey, I have a question.

347
Where is she?

348
Chandler. Relax, Chandler.
She'll be here.

349
Oh, oh, oh. That's her.

350
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

351
You gotta stop staring at the door...

352
...like a watched pot.

353
If you keep looking at it,
the door's never gonna boil.

354
I think what you have to do
is try not to...

355
Oh, my God.

356
Oh...

357
...my...

358
...God.

359
Oh...

360
...my...

361
...God.

362
All right.

363
I've been feeling incredibly guilty
because I wanna be a good friend.

364
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

365
Wow.

366
You are a good friend.

367
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

368
But that was a hell of a kiss.

369
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

1
- Hey.
Hey.

2
So how was Joan?

3
Broke up with her.

4
Oh, why?

5
Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

6
They were huge.

7
When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

8
Come on, they were not that huge.

9
I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

10
How many women will you reject...

11
...over the most superficial,
insignificant things?

12
Hold it. Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

13
When I first moved to the city,
I went out with this girl.

14
Really hot. Great kisser...

15
...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

16
Drove me nuts.

17
- You or me?
- I got it.

18
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

19
Heh, heh.
You guys are messing with me, right?

20
Yeah. We are.

21
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

22
So you name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

23
Maureen Rasillo.

24
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

25
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

26
You're doing it again.

27
We're not doing anything.

28
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

29
You don't have birds.

30
I could have birds.

31
Okay, we'll try to keep it down.

32
Thank you.

33
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

34
All right, bye-bye.

35
Okay, Janice.

36
You gotta give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

37
We'll give you Janice.

38
I miss Janice, though.

39
Hello, Chandler Bing!

40
Oh, my God!

41
Oh, Chandler!

42
Now! Now!

43
That's it.

44
There! Faster!

45
Ugh. Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

46
We won.

47
- We won! Whoo!
- Whoo!

48
Mr. Heckles.

49
- How did this happen?
- He was sweeping.

50
They found a broom in his hand.

51
Oh.
Oh, dear God.

52
- That's terrible.
- I know.

53
I was sweeping yesterday.

54
- It could've been me.
Yeah.

55
Sure.
- Sweeping. You never know.

56
Never know.

57
Okay, it's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

58
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

59
Okay, Phoebe.

60
I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

61
Yeah.
- Here we go.

62
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

63
There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

64
...but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

65
Such as?

66
Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

67
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
What, you don't believe in evolution?

69
No. Not really.

70
You don't believe in evolution?

71
I don't know.
It's just, you know...

72
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

73
"Too easy"? Too...

74
The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

75
...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

76
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

77
Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

78
Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

79
...like gravity.

80
Okay, don't get me started on gravity.

81
You, uh... You don't believe in gravity?

82
Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

83
Lately I get the feeling that...

84
...I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.

85
Pushed.

86
Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton
and he's pissed.

87
There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

88
This is Mr. Buddy Boyle,
Heckles' attorney.

89
He'd like to talk to you.

90
What can we do for you?

91
All right, kids, here's the deal.

92
According my client's will...

93
...he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

94
...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine. "

95
What about his family?

96
- He didn't have any.
Whoa.

97
Okay, so let's talk money.

98
All right, there was none.

99
Now, let's talk signing.

100
You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

101
I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

102
Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

103
...without even knowing it?

104
Would you look at this dump?

105
He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

106
Ever seen so much crap!

107
Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

108
Check this out.

109
Can I have this?

110
How can you not believe in evolution?

111
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

112
Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

113
And I can tell you, we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

114
...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

115
I mean, you can literally see them...

116
...evolving through time.

117
Really? You can actually see it?

118
You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

119
See, I didn't know that.

120
Well, there you go.

121
Huh.

122
So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

123
Hey. Look at this.
My Big Book of Grievances.

124
Hey, there's me.

125
"April 17th, excessive noise...

126
...Italian guy comes home with a date. "
Yeah.

127
Chandler, you're in here too.

128
"April 18th, excessive noise...

129
...Italian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning. "

130
Well, that's excellent.

131
Monica, look at this lamp.

132
Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

133
I think we have enough regular lamps.

134
What? Come on, it's not like...

135
...I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

136
Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

137
Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

138
Well, what about my stuff?

139
You don't have any stuff.

140
You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

141
Mmm... No.

142
Yes, you do.

143
You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

144
Mmm...

145
Okay, while you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

146
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

147
Opposable thumbs!

148
Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

149
Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

150
Tell me you're joking.

151
Look, can't we just say that you believe
in something and I don't?

152
- No. No, Pheebs, we can't.
- Why not?

153
What is this obsessive need you have
to make everybody agree with you?

154
No, what's that all about?
You know what I think?

155
I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

156
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

157
Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

158
Wow. He looks so normal.

159
He's even kind of cute.

160
"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class.

161
You're the funniest kid in school. "

162
- Funniest? Heckles?
- That's what it says.

163
Wow. Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was I.

164
He was right.
Would you listen to that?

165
I'd call that excessive.

166
- Whoa.
- What?

167
Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

168
And he was in the scale
modeler's club and I was...

169
Well, there was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

170
So? You were both dorks.

171
Big deal.

172
I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me...

173
Heckles and me. Me...

174
Me and Heckles.

175
Hey, would you knock it off!

176
Ah!

177
Have you been here all night?

178
Look at this.

179
Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

180
Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall. "

181
"Madge, big gums. "

182
"Too loud. "

183
"Too smart. "
"Makes noise when she eats. "

184
This is me.

185
This is what I do.

186
I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

187
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.

188
Our trains are on the same track.

189
I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

190
Bitter Town...

191
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

192
You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

193
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

194
What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

195
...but I dumped her because
she pronounces it "supposably"?

196
Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

197
How do you know that? How?

198
I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

199
You guys will all get married...

200
...and I'll end up alone.

201
Will you promise me something?

202
When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

203
I don't know what we'll be doing.

204
I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

205
Yeah, I understand.

206
You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

207
Every year, all right?

208
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

209
I'll see you, man.

210
Jeez.

211
"Supposably. "

212
Supposably.

213
Did they go to the zoo?

214
Supposably.

215
Hi. It's me.

216
Oh, my God!

217
Janice? You called Janice?

218
Yes. Janice.

219
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

220
You remember Janice, right?

221
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

222
Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

223
Hello.

224
Oh, my God!

225
Jeez, look how fat she got.

226
- Hey, it's everybody.
Hi, Janice.

227
Janice, you're...

228
Yes, I am.

229
- Is it...?
- Is it yours? Ha!

230
You wish, Chandler Bing.

231
You are looking at a married lady now.

232
Oh.

233
Yeah.

234
Congratulations.

235
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.

236
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

237
And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no.

238
Janice likes to have her fun.

239
You know what we haven't
played in a while?

240
- What?
- Hide the lamp.

241
Monica, let it go.

242
Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

243
Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

244
Uh-oh. It's scary scientist man.

245
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

246
In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

247
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

248
Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

249
Okay, look, before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

250
It's just one of the possibilities.

251
It's the only possibility.

252
Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much? Okay?

253
Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds
in the world believe the Earth was flat?

254
And up till 50 years ago, you all thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

255
...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

256
Now, are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

257
...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

258
...that you could be wrong about this?

259
There might be...

260
...a teeny...

261
...tiny...

262
...possibility.

263
I can't believe you caved.

264
What?

265
You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

266
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

267
But...

268
How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

269
How are you going to face
the other science guys?

270
How are you going to face yourself?
Oh...

271
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

272
I am.

273
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

274
What happened?

275
Okay.
All right, it was an accident, I swear.

276
I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

277
Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

278
And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

279
Phoebe, tell her?

280
I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

281
But I want to believe you.

282
Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

283
Neat.

284
I'm gonna die alone!

285
Okay, you win.

286
Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

287
Janice was my safety net, okay?

288
And now I have to get a snake.

289
Uh-huh. Why is that?

290
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

291
You know, a hook.

292
Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

293
So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake. "

294
Crazy Snake Man.

295
Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

296
Kids won't walk past my place,
they will run!

297
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"
they'll shout!

298
You've got to get over this. Okay?

299
You won't end up alone.

300
Of course I am.

301
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

302
...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

303
Chandler, you have just described...

304
...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

305
Yeah.

306
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

307
She's right.

308
You're no different than the rest.

309
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

310
You are totally different.

311
In a bad way?

312
No, honey, in a wonderful way.

313
You know what you want now.

314
Most guys don't even have a clue.

315
You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

316
You're not gonna end up alone.

317
You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

318
- You've made it.
- You're there.

319
You are ready to make a commitment!

320
Whoa! Don't know about that.

321
Wow. What you got there?

322
Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

323
No.

324
I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

325
It'll look good in our apartment.

326
Thank you.

327
That's fine.

328
- Hey.
Hey.

329
You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

330
This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

331
She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

332
...holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

333
...unusually large head.

334
But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

335
All right.

336
Look at me. I'm growing.

337
Hey, you can't recycle yearbooks,
can you?

338
I'll take that.

339
You want his yearbook?

340
Yeah. Yeah. Some people said nice things
about him. Somebody should have it.

341
Gosh, this is so weird.

342
His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

343
I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

344
I mean, he was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

345
What?

346
You're all going to hell.

347
It's really not that big.

348
- Taking that with you, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

349
Hey, you coming?

350
Yeah, in a second.

351
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

352
We'll try to keep it down.

353
My major was useless.

354
How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

355
Heh, heh. Sure.

356
My God, that's a big head!

357
It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.

358
My head must look
like a golf ball at work.

359
Don't get hung up on it. Quick, quick.
List five things you like about her.

360
Nice smile, good dresser.

361
Big head, big head, big head!

1
Mom, would you relax?

2
That was 10 blocks from here,
and the woman was walking alone at night.

3
I would never do that.

4
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
This is a safe street.
This is a safe building. There's nothing...

6
Aah! Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

7
Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.

8
Oh, my God.

9
Okay.

10
That's fine, you just read the paper.

11
I'm gonna get a pot.

12
It's not for you.

13
Okay, that's fine.

14
Read the Family Circus...

15
...enjoy the gentle comedy...

16
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17
Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

18
It's open, you guys.

19
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I help you?

20
I'm looking for Phoebe,
does she still live here?

21
Uh, no, she doesn't.
But I can get a message to her.

22
Great. Uh, just tell her
her husband stopped by.

23
Her what? Aah!

24
Hey, how did you do that?

25
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

26
I'm not "married" married,
you know?

27
He was just a friend, and he's gay...

28
...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

29
I can't believe you married Duncan.

30
I mean, how could you not tell me?

31
We lived together,
we told each other everything.

32
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get really, like, judgmental...

33
...and would not approve.

34
Of course I wouldn't approve.

35
You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

36
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

37
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

38
Okay, I wasn't in love with him.
I was just helping out a friend.

39
Please. When he left town,
you stayed in your pajamas for a month.

40
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

41
Well, didn't you?

42
I might have.

43
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

44
Come on.
Like you tell me everything?

45
What have I not told you?

46
Ooh, I don't know. Um...

47
...how about the fact that the underwear
out there on the telephone pole is yours...

48
...from when you were having sex
with Fun Bobby on the terrace.

49
What?
- Wait a minute. Who told you?

50
You are dead meat.

51
I didn't know it was a big secret.

52
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

53
You know, kind of on the same lines as,
say, I don't know, having a third nipple.

54
You have a third nipple?

55
You bitch.

56
- Whip it out. Whip it out.
Yeah, yeah.

57
No, come on. There's nothing to see.
It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.

58
Oh, as opposed to your other
multifunctional nipples?

59
I can't believe you.
You told me it was a nubbin.

60
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

61
I don't know. You see something, you
hear a word, I thought that's what it was.

62
- Let me see it again.
Yeah, show us your nubbin.

63
Joey was in a porno movie.

64
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me.

65
Oh, my God.
You were in a porno?

66
All right, all right.
I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?

67
But at the last minute
I couldn't go through with it.

68
So they let me be the guy who comes in
to fix the copier but can't...

69
...because there's people
having sex on it.

70
Wow.

71
That is wild.

72
- So, what's it shaped like?
- Is there a hair on it?

73
What happens if you flick it?

74
So, uh, does it do anything,
you know, special?

75
Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

76
...to the magical land of Narnia.

77
You know, in some cultures, having
a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

78
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

79
Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

80
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

81
Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.

82
Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

83
But he's with her now.
You're just gonna have to get over it.

84
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

85
God, see, I didn't know that's what
I had to do. I just have to get over it.

86
Whoa.

87
Sassy lady.
Where are you going?

88
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

89
He's in the Capades.

90
- The Ice Capades?
- No, no, the Gravel Capades.

91
Yeah, the turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

92
I can't believe you're dressing up for him.

93
You're setting yourself up
all over again.

94
Okay, no.

95
For your information, I'm going to see him
so I can put all those feelings behind me.

96
And the reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

97
...to look nice for your gay husband.

98
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

99
Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?

100
Oh, I see, I see.
Because of the third-nipple thing.

101
- Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

102
- See you later, Rach.
- Bye-bye, Julie.

103
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
Hey, come on, cut it out.

105
Hey.
What?

106
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

107
Eh.
What?

108
- Come on, talk to me.
- Okay.

109
What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

110
...having the sex?

111
Why? Who's not...?
Are you and Julie not...?

112
Are you and Julie not having sex?

113
Well...

114
Technically?

115
- No.
- Wow.

116
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

117
Or is it because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

118
No. No. She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

119
I mean, we do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like...

120
No, no, no.
Don't need to know the details.

121
No, it's just...

122
It's me.

123
You know, I've only been
with one woman my whole life...

124
...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

125
Uh-huh.

126
So now I've got myself all psyched out.

127
It's become, like, this...

128
...this thing, and I...

129
You must just think I'm weird.

130
No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.

131
I think... I think, um, in fact...

132
- In fact, you know what I think?
- What?

133
I think it's sexy.

134
Sexy?

135
Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

136
...there is nothing sexier...

137
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

138
- No kidding.
- Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?

139
I'd wait.

140
- You'd wait?
- Yes, absolutely. I would wait...

141
...and wait...

142
Then I'd wait some more.

143
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

144
I don't care how much she tells you
she wants it, I don't care if she begs...

145
...she pleads, she tells you
she's gonna have sex with another man.

146
That just means it's working.

147
Women really want this?

148
More than jewelry.

149
Hi.

150
- Phoebe.
- Ta-da.

151
Hi.

152
Ah, look at you. You look great.

153
Do I? Thank you.

154
- So do you. Sparkly.
- Thanks.

155
So...

156
Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh,
Mr. Major Capades Guy.

157
I remember when you were just like
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

158
You always said I'd make it.

159
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.

160
God, I missed you.

161
- I'm gonna get changed.
- Okay.

162
Um, now.

163
What?
Pheebs.

164
Oh. Right. Okay.

165
- Olé.
- What?

166
The Matador, so...

167
Olé. Ha, ha.

168
- Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?
- Sure.

169
Thanks.

170
- Uh, Julie?
- Yeah.

171
Sorry, you had a paleontologist
on your face.

172
But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.

173
- Hi, everyone.
Hi.

174
Oh, listen, listen...

175
I wanted to thank you
for, uh, our little talk before.

176
Oh, God, no problem.
So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?

177
Well, I was going to,
but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

178
Good. Ahem. What did he say?

179
Basically, he told me to get over myself
and just do it.

180
So I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

181
And, well, his way,
I get to have sex tonight, so...

182
What is this in my pocket?

183
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

184
Pop it in.

185
I'm fine with it, I mean,
if you're okay watching a video...

186
...filled with two-nippled people.

187
Great. People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

188
What's wrong with people having sex?

189
Well...

190
Well, um, you know,
these movies are offensive...

191
...and, uh, degrading
to women and females...

192
And, uh, the lighting's
always unflattering.

193
And...

194
- Monica, help me out here.
- Hell, I wanna see Joey.

195
So is there, like, a story,
or do they just start doing it right...

196
Oh. Never mind.

197
Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the
craziest typing test I've ever seen.

198
All I say is, she better get the job.

199
Looks to me like he's the one
getting the job.

200
Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.

201
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

202
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"

203
So I just watch them have sex.

204
And then I say... Here's my line.

205
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

206
- Nice work, my friend.
- Thank you.

207
Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

208
There I am. There I am. There I am.

209
So, um... So, what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

210
Oh, yeah, um...

211
All right.

212
I kind of need a divorce.

213
Okay.

214
How come?

215
Um, actually, I'm getting married again.

216
What?

217
Oh, God,
I don't know how to tell you this.

218
I'm straight.

219
Yeah, I know.

220
I don't understand. I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

221
I mean, you're so smart and funny...

222
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties.

223
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.

224
But you just reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

225
So how long have you known?

226
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

227
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

228
You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my
friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

229
And, um... And there's actually a woman?

230
- Her name's Debra.
- Oh.

231
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

232
Well, I've never told you this...

233
...but there were one or two times
back in college...

234
...when I'd get really drunk
and go to a straight bar...

235
...and wake up with a woman next to me.

236
But I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

237
Sure.

238
But now I know I don't have a choice
about this. I was born this way.

239
I don't know what to say.

240
I mean, you know,
you're married to someone for six years...

241
...and you think you know him.

242
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay. "

243
I'm... I'm still me.

244
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

245
You know,
it still smells like monkey in there.

246
Well, that saves us the conversation.

247
Well, this has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

248
- Me too. We should get going.
No.

249
No. I mean... No. Come on, you guys.

250
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.

251
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

252
Rachel, that's all we do.

253
Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

254
What about Julie?

255
Well, you have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

256
...and we don't really know you.

257
I mean, who is Julie?

258
I mean, what do you like?
What don't you like?

259
We want to know everything.

260
Well, heh, that could take a while.

261
So?

262
I mean, who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

263
- I got the time to get to know Julie.
- I got time, yeah.

264
Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

265
That's fine.

266
Okay, Julie, so let's start with
your childhood. What was that like?

267
- Well, in a nutshell...
- Ah-ah-ah.

268
So, um, have you told your parents?

269
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

270
My brother's straight, so...

271
Here you go.

272
You know what?
I just have one more question. Um...

273
If you had figured this out sooner,
and, um, I had been around...

274
...do you think I would have been
the one who?

275
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.

276
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

277
I love you, Phoebe.

278
So your brother's straight, huh?

279
Seriously.

280
- And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

281
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

282
Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?

283
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

284
Hmm, okay.

285
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

286
I'm going home.

287
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

288
Good night.

289
Whew.

290
So it's pretty late. You're probably, uh,
not still planning on...

291
- Oh. No, no, I am.
- Oh.

292
Well, hey, are you nervous?

293
No, no. I, uh...

294
I have done it before.

295
Well, okay, I mean,
how are you gonna handle it?

296
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

297
I, uh... I don't know.
I guess I'm just gonna...

298
...see what happens.

299
Okay. Good luck.

300
What...? Uh...

301
- What?
- Nothing. I mean, um...

302
It is your first time with her, and, you know,
if the first time doesn't go well...

303
...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

304
Okay, now I'm nervous.

305
Maybe you should put it off.

306
No, I don't want to put it off.

307
God, I'm just... I spent last year
being so unbelievably miserable.

308
And now I'm actually happy.

309
You know, I mean, really happy.

310
I just don't wanna...

311
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

312
I know.

313
Yeah.

314
I'm sorry.

315
No, it's not your fault.

316
Right.

317
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

318
Maybe you were on the right track with
that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

319
- I mean, women really like that.
- Really?

320
Yeah. I mean, you know, if...

321
I mean if it were me, I'd, you know,
want you to...

322
- What?
- I don't know, catch me off guard.

323
You know, with, like, a really...

324
...good kiss.

325
You know, really...

326
...sort of, um, soft at first.

327
And then maybe, um,
brush the hair away from my face.

328
And then look far into my eyes...

329
...in a way that lets me
know something...

330
...amazing is about to happen.

331
Uh-huh.

332
And then, I don't know, then...

333
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

334
So that I'd be pressed up, you know,
right against you.

335
And, um, it would get kind of...

336
...sweaty...

337
...and, uh... And blurry.

338
And then it's just happening.

339
Oh.

340
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

341
Oh, God.

342
Good morning.

343
Well, somebody got some last night.

344
Twice.

1
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
Spanish midgets.

3
Spanish midgets wrestling...

4
Julie.
Okay, yes, I see how you got there.

5
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.

7
I figure if I always answer the phone,
people will think I don't have a life.

8
My God.
Rodrigo never gets pinned.

9
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

10
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

11
This is Jade.

12
I don't know if you're still at this number,
but I was just thinking about us...

13
...and how great it was, and, well,
I know it's been three years...

14
...but I was kind of hoping
we could hook up again.

15
You know, I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

16
...so you know what I did?
- What?

17
I got a little drunk...

18
...and naked.

19
Bob here.

20
So, uh, what have you been up to?

21
Oh, you know, the usual.

22
Teaching aerobics...

23
...partying way too much. Heh.

24
Oh, and in case you were wondering...

25
...those are my legs
on the new James Bond poster.

26
Can you hold on a moment?
I have another call.

27
- I love her.
- I know.

28
- I'm back.
So are we gonna get together?

29
Uh, absolutely.

30
Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?

31
Do you know, uh, Central Perk
in the village? Say, five-ish?

32
Great. I'll see you then.
- Okay.

33
Okay.

34
Having a phone has finally paid off.

35
Even though you do
do a good Bob impression...

36
...I'm thinking when
she sees you tomorrow...

37
...she's probably gonna realize, hey,
you're not Bob.

38
I am hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

39
...she will seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next table.

40
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.

41
Okay, pure evil...

42
...horny and alone.

43
I've done this.

44
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.

45
Hey, everybody.
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

46
Hi, Julie.

47
Hi, Julie.

48
Okay. While Ross is on the phone...

49
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

50
Um, is there any chance
that you're rounding up from...

51
...you know, from like 20?

52
Hey, come on, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

53
Do we need a cake?

54
Look, I know it's a little steep.

55
Whoosh.

56
But it's Ross.

57
- Yeah, it's Ross.
Yeah, you're right.

58
All right? Okay. I'll see you later.
I gotta go...

59
...do a thing.

60
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later tonight.

61
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not
really going through with this, are you?

62
You know, I think I might just.

63
So, uh, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

64
Well, I guess I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

65
So I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

66
Can you believe how much
this is gonna cost?

67
Do you guys ever get the feeling
that, um...

68
...Chandler and those guys...

69
...just don't get that we don't make
as much money as they do?

70
- Yes.
Really?

71
It's like they're always saying,
"Let's go here, let's go there. "

72
- Like we can afford to go here and there.
- Yeah.

73
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice, you know?

74
It's not like we can say anything about it,
because, like, this is a birthday thing...

75
...you know, and it's for Ross.

76
- For Ross.
- For Ross.

77
Oh, my God.

78
- Hi.
- What?

79
Okay. I'm at work...

80
...just an ordinary day, you know,
chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

81
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

82
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef,
and guess who got the job.

83
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

84
- Fortunately, it is me.
- Oh.

85
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you very much.

86
That's so cool.

87
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross.
We should go out and celebrate.

88
You know, someplace nice.

89
- Someplace nice.
Yeah.

90
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

91
I'm telling you, you can't do this.

92
Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

93
That doesn't matter.

94
She wanted to call Bob.

95
Hey, for all we know,
Bob is who she was meant to be with.

96
You may be destroying
two people's chance for happiness.

97
We don't know Bob.

98
Okay? We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

99
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

100
All right.

101
Go.

102
Hi.

103
Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...

104
I have to confess something.

105
Yes?

106
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

107
- How did you...
- I don't know.

108
I just had this weird sense. You know?
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

109
Tissue?

110
Thanks.

111
No, no, you keep the pack.

112
I'm all cried out today.

113
Okay, okay.

114
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

115
Who is also in charge of purchasing.

116
Newly appointed head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing...

117
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

118
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing,
own little desk when Roland's not there...

119
...here's to my little sister...
- Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.

120
Oh, cool.

121
- That's fine, I'll just wait.
- Aw, sorry.

122
Oh, sorry, sorry.

123
Monica.

124
Are we ready to order?

125
Oh. You know,
we haven't even looked yet.

126
Well, when you do, just let me know.

127
I'll be right over there
on the edge of my seat.

128
Wow, look at these prices.

129
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching. "

130
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

131
- Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.
- Thanks.

132
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

133
Well, pretty incredible, according to
the message she left on my machine.

134
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman
leaving a message for you on my machine?

135
See, I had to tell her
that my number was your number.

136
I couldn't tell her
my number was my number...

137
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

138
Hey, tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

139
Do I dare ask?

140
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then I'll have the grilled prawns.

141
That sounds great, same for me.

142
And for the gentleman?

143
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

144
But, hey, look, if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

145
...is it cheaper?

146
You'd think, wouldn't you?

147
- Miss?
- Okay.

148
I will have the, uh...

149
...side salad.

150
And what would that be on the side of?

151
I don't know.

152
Why don't you just put it right here
next to my water?

153
And for you?

154
Um, I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup...

155
...and, um...

156
...take care.

157
- I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.
- Anything else?

158
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

159
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

160
Plus tip, divided by six...

161
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.

162
Um, everyone?

163
Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.

164
Thank you.

165
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

166
Aw, thank you.

167
So five of us is...

168
...33.50 apiece.

169
No. Uh-uh. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

170
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.

171
Sorry, Monica.
I'm really happy you got promoted...

172
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

173
No.

174
Rachel just had that little salad...

175
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

176
Okay, Pheebs.

177
How about we'll each
just pay for what we had, okay?

178
- It's no big deal.
- Not for you.

179
All right, what's going on?

180
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

181
- It'll just make everybody uncomfortable.
- Oh, fine. All right, fine.

182
- What? Whoa, whoa.
- You can tell us.

183
Yeah, hello? It's us.
All right? We'll be fine.

184
Ahem. Okay, um...

185
Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...

186
...sometimes you guys don't get that,
uh, ahem...

187
We don't have as much money as you.

188
- Okay.
- I hear you.

189
We can talk about that.

190
Well, then...

191
...let's.

192
Well, um, I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

193
- That's because you have it.
- That's a good point.

194
So, um, how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

195
Because it's always something, you know?
Like with Monica's new job...

196
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

197
What? Whoa, hey.

198
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

199
There's gonna be a hoopla?

200
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing and it's...

201
If it makes anybody feel better,
we can just forget the thing...

202
...and we'll just do the gift.

203
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

204
No, the thing was we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

205
Hootie and the... Oh, my...
I can catch them on the radio.

206
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

207
No, look, hey, it's my birthday...

208
...and the important thing
is that we all be together.

209
- All of us.
- Together.

210
Not at the concert.

211
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.

212
Yeah.

213
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

214
Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?

215
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

216
Oh, it's like a skit.

217
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

218
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

219
We switched meat suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

220
But wait, there's more.
Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?

221
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

222
Come on.

223
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish.

224
The Blowfish.

225
It's on us, all right? So don't worry.
This is our treat.

226
So... thank you.

227
Could you be less enthused?

228
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

229
But it just feels like...

230
Like?

231
- Charity.
- Charity?

232
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

233
But, Ross, you have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feel about this big.

234
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

235
What? I don't understand. I mean,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

236
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

237
Maybe that's just how you feel.

238
Oh.

239
- Now you're telling us how we feel.
- We never should have talked about this.

240
I'm gonna pass on the concert...

241
...because I'm just not in a very
Hootie place right now.

242
- Me neither.
- Me too.

243
Guys, we bought the tickets.

244
Well, then you'll have extra seats,
you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

245
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

246
So I guess now we can't go.

247
Come on, do what you want. Do we
always have to do everything together?

248
You know what? You're right.

249
- Fine.
- Fine.

250
- Fine.
- All right.

251
We're gonna go.

252
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

253
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

254
Oh, jeez.

255
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

256
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

257
Whoa, whoa.

258
What? You had sex today?

259
Wow. It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it.

260
I was awesome, okay? She was
biting her lip to stop from screaming.

261
Wow.

262
Now, I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

263
Still doing the screening thing?

264
I had sex today.

265
I never have to answer that phone again.

266
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

267
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

268
I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day.

269
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

270
Bob here.

271
Oh, hi.

272
So, uh, you met someone, huh?

273
Yes. Yes, I did.

274
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

275
So, uh, how was he?

276
Eh...

277
"Eh"?

278
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

279
I had to bite my lip to keep
from screaming your name.

280
Well, that makes me feel so good.

281
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

282
Bumpy?

283
Maybe he had some kind of, uh,
new cool style that you're not familiar with.

284
And, uh,
maybe you have to get used to it.

285
There wasn't much time to get used to it...

286
...if you know what I mean.

287
You know what?
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

288
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

289
So let's go.

290
Well, you know,
maybe we should stay for one song.

291
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

292
You know, the guys are probably
having a great time.

293
Every time I look at you
I go blind

294
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

295
Okay.

296
- One.
- No.

297
Thank you very much.
We are Hootie & The Blowfish.

298
- That was amazing.
- Excellent.

299
I can't believe the guys missed this.

300
What guys? Oh, yeah.

301
Excuse me.
You're Monica Geller, aren't you?

302
- Do I know you?
- You used to be my baby-sitter.

303
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?

304
How have you been?

305
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.

306
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.

307
Well, listen, it was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

308
Wait, backstage?

309
Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.

310
- Ross.
- Chandler.

311
- Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
- Yeah, we do.

312
Come on.

313
So, look, are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my dad?

314
- Hey, you guys.
Happy birthday.

315
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

316
So, uh...

317
How was your night last night?

318
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

319
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

320
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

321
Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.

322
Hey, how's his dad?

323
Good.

324
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening
was pretty much a bust.

325
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

326
Yeah, look, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

327
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like...

328
Is that a hickey?

329
Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...

330
I fell down.

331
On someone's lips?

332
Where'd you get the hickey?

333
- You know, a party or...
- What party?

334
Well, it wasn't a party so much as a...
A gathering of people.

335
With food and music and...

336
And the band.

337
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

338
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

339
Who gave you that hickey?

340
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

341
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

342
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

343
...and you guys are out, like,
partying and having fun and all:

344
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck. "

345
Hey, look, don't blame us.
You guys could've been there.

346
Oh, what? As part of your
Poor Friends Outreach program?

347
Oh, great. It's work.

348
Look, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry that we make more than you.

349
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
We work really hard for it.

350
And we don't work hard?

351
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.

352
I'm just saying that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

353
- Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.
- Yes.

354
No.

355
Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

356
Wait, I don't understand.

357
Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor.

358
That was not a kickback.

359
Come on, I'll just replace them
and we can forget the whole thing.

360
What corporate policy?

361
Yeah.

362
Okay.

363
I just got fired.

364
Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.

365
Let me get that.

366
You got 5 bucks?

367
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

368
Hi, it's me.

369
Listen, Bob,
I'm probably way out of line here.

370
I mean, it has been three years, and you're
probably seeing someone else now...

371
...but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake...

372
One hot, steamy, wild night...

1
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
Oh,
you the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

3
Yes.

4
Don't cry.

5
Don't cry, huh?

6
Why is he still crying?

7
Let me hold him for a sec.

8
Here we go. Huh?

9
Huh. There we are.

10
Maybe it's me.

11
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

12
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

13
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

14
There we go, all better.

15
There's my little boy. Eh.

16
Can I, uh, see something?

17
- Cool!
- He hates me.

18
- My nephew hates me!
- Come on, don't do this.

19
What if my own baby hates me, huh?
What do I do then?

20
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

21
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

22
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

23
Joey, she does not look fat.

24
Here you go.

25
Oh, hey, Mon.

26
Goo, goo, goo!

27
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec. Ha-ha-ha.

28
Whoa.

29
You okay?

30
I don't know.

31
What's in this pie?

32
I don't know. Um, butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi...

33
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

34
You said it was a key lime pie.

35
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

36
That's what's gonna kill me.

37
Ahem. I'm allergic to kiwi.

38
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and...

39
- Oh, my God!
- Uh. It's definitely getting worse.

40
All right. Is your tongue swelling up?

41
Either that
or my mouth is getting smaller!

42
- Get your coat. We'll to the hospital.
- Uh.

43
- Will he be okay?
- He's gotta get a shot.

44
Uh, you know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

45
Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?

46
Jacket, now!

47
What about Ben?
We can't bring a baby to the hospital.

48
We'll watch him.

49
Uh. Ha, I don't think so.

50
What? I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

51
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

52
I was gonna play basketball...

53
...but I guess that's out the window.

54
If you take him out
for a walk, remember to bring his hat.

55
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

56
Hat, milk... Got it!

57
- Let's go.
- Okay.

58
Consider it done!

59
You understood?

60
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

61
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

62
Hey, Rach.

63
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

64
- I wrote it this morning in the shower.
- Okay.

65
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song

66
Stop me if you've heard it

67
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

68
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

69
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

70
What's up?
- Uh...

71
FYl:

72
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

73
Her name is Stephanie something.
Uh, she's supposed to be very good.

74
But what about Phoebe?

75
Rachel, uh,
it's not that your friend is bad.

76
It's that she's so bad...

77
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

78
...and swirl it around.

79
Okay, so you're not a fan.

80
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

81
Uh.

82
Oh, no, no, no.

83
- I have to do this to her?
- Mm-hm.

84
Lather, rinse, repeat

85
And lather, rinse, repeat

86
As needed

87
We didn't bring enough stuff.

88
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

89
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

90
It's a known fact
that women love babies, all right?

91
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

92
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

93
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

94
- Give me the baby.
- No, I got him.

95
Come on, seriously.

96
Oh, seriously, you want him?

97
Hello.

98
Hello.

99
Who is this little cutie-pie?

100
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

101
...me.

102
Want to smell him?

103
I assume we're talking
about the baby?

104
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

105
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

106
My uterus just skipped a beat.

107
What'd I tell you?

108
It's great you're doing this.

109
Well, we are great guys.

110
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

111
What agency did you two go through?

112
But this is my gig.

113
This is where I play.

114
My name is written out there in chalk.

115
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

116
Honey, I'm sorry.

117
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

118
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

119
And, like, you know, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

120
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

121
That's where that came from.

122
Yeah, okay.

123
You probably did everything you could.

124
You know what? Let me just
see what else I can do.

125
All right, look, look.

126
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

127
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

128
I don't know.

129
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

130
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

131
Of course I clean it.

132
I mean, I will clean it.

133
All right, fine, fine, fine!

134
Oh.

135
- Done.
- Really?

136
Who's working for you, babe?

137
- Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
I know.

138
How much am I gonna get?

139
What?

140
He's paying the people
who were playing.

141
Oh, no, no, no.

142
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

143
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

144
But, Pheebs...

145
Uh-uh, I'm sorry, no!

146
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

147
There are thousands of places
in this city...

148
...where people would pay
to hear me play.

149
When I play, I play for me

150
I don't need your charity

151
Thank you!

152
I'm not getting a
shot. Maybe they can take the needle...

153
...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

154
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

155
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

156
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

157
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

158
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

159
My brother, the Ph. D.,
would like to know...

160
...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

161
No.

162
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

163
So?

164
Oh.

165
Go and have a seat. Um, the doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

166
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

167
- Okay.
- Okay.

168
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

169
- You want to squeeze my hand?
- Yes.

170
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

171
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

172
Let go of my hand!

173
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

174
...we should go to
the park and make out.

175
Taxi! Taxi!

176
Look at that talent.

177
Just practicing. You're good.

178
Carry on.

179
Wait, wait, wait!

180
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

181
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

182
- What are you guys out doing today?
- We're not out.

183
No, no. No.

184
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

185
...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

186
- You done?
- Yeah.

187
Oh, there's our stop.

188
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

189
- You guys live around here too?
- Yeah, sure.

190
We live in the building
by the, uh, sidewalk.

191
You know it?

192
Ha, ha. Since we're neighbors, what do
you say we, uh, get together for a drink?

193
So, uh, you want to go to Markel's?

194
Oh, sure, they love us over there.

195
Where's your baby?

196
Ben! Ben!

197
Ben! Ben!

198
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

199
Stop the bus! Hey!

200
Hey, there's a baby!
Wait, wait, wait!

201
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It hurts.

202
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

203
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

204
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

205
Sorry.

206
Hmm, sorry! I got my S's back!
Ha, ha.

207
Which we can celebrate later.

208
Celebrate. Celebrate...

209
He was a double, double

210
Double-jointed boy

211
Hey.

212
So, um, are you the
professional guitar player?

213
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

214
Oh, right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

215
Okay.

216
So, um,
how many chords do you know?

217
- All of them.
- So you know D?

218
- Yeah.
- Do you know A-minor?

219
- Yeah.
- Okay.

220
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

221
- Yeah.
- Okay.

222
Um, so does your guitar have a strap?

223
- No.
- Oh.

224
Mine does.

225
Stephanie knows all the chords

226
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

227
Hello. Ahem.

228
Transit Authority? Yes, hello.

229
I'm doing research for a book.

230
I was wondering what somebody might
do if they left a baby on a city bus.

231
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

232
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

233
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

234
Oh, and there was a baby in it.

235
He wants to talk to you.

236
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to...

237
Terry's a jerk and he won't let me work

238
And I hate Central Perk

239
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer!

240
Whoo!

241
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

242
Zachary...

243
Are all invited to bite me

244
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

245
- He's here.
- Aah!

246
I assume one of you is the father.

247
- That's me.
- I'm him.

248
Actually, uh, ahem,
we're both the father.

249
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

250
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

251
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

252
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

253
Or clowns.

254
Oh, wait.

255
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

256
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

257
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

258
Okay, the mole came off.

259
- What are we gonna do?
- Uh.

260
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

261
- Flip for the baby?
- You got a better idea?

262
All right, call it in the air.

263
Heads.

264
- Heads, it is.
- Yes.

265
We have to assign heads
to something!

266
Right! Okay.

267
Okay, uh...

268
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

269
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

270
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

271
Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

272
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

273
Then slowly turn away

274
I won't beg you to stay

275
With me

276
- Hey
- Oh, hi.

277
Here. I thought you might be cold.

278
Thank you.

279
Oh.

280
Oh, look at you!
You did pretty well.

281
$8.27.

282
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

283
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

284
Do you?

285
No.

286
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

287
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

288
...I got, like, $1.75.

289
But then "Smelly Cat"? Oh.

290
I got 25 cents and a condom.

291
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat. "

292
Well, you know.

293
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat. "

294
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

295
But it's not even that, you know?

296
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

297
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

298
Well, people missed you in there.

299
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat. "

300
Really? From who?

301
Well, me.

302
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

303
Hi.

304
Uh. Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

305
It's kind of an emergency.

306
Yeah.

307
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

308
Hey, Christine! I got it!

309
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

310
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand. Ha, ha.

311
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

312
Mm.

313
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

314
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

315
Oh.

316
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

317
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

318
...and you hit your head on the curb?

319
No.

320
But I remember
people telling me about it.

321
Oh.

322
I hope Ben has a little sister.

323
Yeah.

324
And I hope she can kick his ass.

325
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

326
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

327
That was you?

328
Uh.

329
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

330
Aw.

331
My little nephew.

332
Come here, little one!

333
Oh. There's my little baby, Ben!

334
Hey, my little boy. Oh.

335
Hey, he's not crying!

336
Hey, he's not crying!

337
Yes.

338
There's still pie! Ha-ha-ha.

339
I'm here. I'm here.

340
Uh. How's my little boy, huh?

341
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

342
Did you have fun with, uh, Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

343
Oh, yeah.

344
- He rode the bus today.
Ooh.

345
Well.

346
Big boy riding the bus...

347
Hey, I have a question.

348
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

349
You...

350
You are gonna love this.

351
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

352
Come here. Come here.

353
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

354
Smelly cat, smelly cat

355
What are they feeding you?

356
No, no. I'm sorry, it's, ahem:

357
Smelly cat, smelly cat

358
Smelly cat, smelly cat

359
- Better!
Yeah?

360
Much better. Good.

361
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

362
Yeah.

363
- You want to try it again?
- From the top?

364
There is no "top," all right?

365
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat. "

366
Um. Ahem.
Why don't you just follow me?

367
- Okay.
Mm-hm.

368
Smelly cat, smelly cat

369
What are they feeding you?

370
Smelly cat, smelly cat

371
It's not your fault

372
That's too much. Sorry.

1
Okay. What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

2
Is there something
repellent about me?

3
How was the party?

4
It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

5
So, what is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
I go through the exact same thing.

8
Every time I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

9
Whoa, whoa.

10
I've put on a little weight?

11
- Did you want to?
- Yeah, uh...

12
No, not weight. More like insulation.

13
Chandler, I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

14
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

15
Uh, I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

16
- Please?
- Come on, let her do it!

17
All right. But if we put on spandex...

18
...and my boobs are bigger than yours,
I'm going home.

19
Your boobs are fine.
Look, I never should have said anything.

20
Come here. Come here!

21
Ooh, can't make hands meet!

22
Okay! Let's do it.

23
What?

24
Nothing. Just never seen
you in little stretchy pants before.

25
And we're changing.

26
- Unh!
- Come on, give me five more!

27
- Ugh. Aah!
- Five more!

28
Five more and I'll flash you.

29
One...

30
...two...

31
...two and a half.

32
Just show me one of them.

33
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

34
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

35
She's insane! The woman is insane.

36
It's before work, after work,
and during work.

37
She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

38
And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

39
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?

40
Oh, um, it was nice.
Took him to a romantic restaurant...

41
...ordered champagne. Nice.

42
- The guy still won't put out?
- Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.

43
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Sorry, Pheebs.

44
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow.

45
I like him a lot.

46
He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

47
Why won't he give it up?

48
Maybe he, uh, drives his car
on the other side of the road.

49
If you know what I mean.

50
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

51
- Maybe he's gay.
- Oh!

52
Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.

53
We went, um,
dancing the other night...

54
...and just the way he held me so close
and the way he was looking into my eyes...

55
...I just definitely felt something.

56
Yeah, but how much can you
tell from a look?

57
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

58
Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

59
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

60
Heh.

61
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

62
What?

63
Come on, guys.
I don't care. I have a date tonight.

64
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have a date?

65
Yeah. Monica's setting me up.

66
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...

67
What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

68
Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

69
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

70
So you're okay about all this?

71
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

72
He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

73
For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

74
- Hi, guys.
Hey.

75
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

76
Only if you say his full name.

77
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

78
- All right.
- You're getting a cat?

79
Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.

80
- Together?
- Uh-huh.

81
- Both of you? Together?
Yup.

82
It'll live with Ross half the time
and me half the time.

83
Oh, well, isn't that just lovely?

84
Ha, ha. That's something
the two of you will be able to enjoy...

85
...for a really, really, really long time.

86
- Hopefully.
Oh, wow.

87
Whoa! Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

88
With a man. Ahem, okay.

89
You guys have a really, uh, good night...

90
...and you two have a, uh,
really good cat. Heh.

91
We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

92
I don't know if Monica told you...

93
...but this the first date I've gone on
since my divorce.

94
So if I seem a little nervous...

95
...I am.

96
How long do cats live?

97
- I'm sorry?
- Cats. How long do they live?

98
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

99
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

100
Well, that's just great.

101
- Um, cheers.
- Mm.

102
Right. Clink. Heh.

103
Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

104
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just...

105
It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds...

106
...but this friend of mine
is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

107
Oh, that does sound...

108
- Huh.
- He just started going out with her.

109
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?

110
Yeah, he wishes.

111
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.

112
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.

113
- All right.
- Okay. Okay?

114
So...

115
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

116
- So I figured it out.
- What?

117
Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

118
I'm not sexy enough.

119
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.

120
When I first met you,
you know what I said to Chandler?

121
- Mm-mm.
- I said, "Excellent butt, great rack. "

122
Really? That's so sweet.

123
I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

124
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

125
You're right. You're right.

126
Ugh, you are so yum!

127
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

128
Why can't they get one of those bugs?
One of those fruit flies.

129
Those things that live for a day.

130
What are they called?
What are they called?

131
- Fruit flies?
- Yes!

132
- Thank you.
- Would you like any dessert?

133
No! No dessert.

134
Just the check. Please.

135
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

136
No, no, I am.

137
But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

138
Oh, look at me.

139
Look at me.

140
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.

141
All I can think about is Ross...

142
...and his cat...

143
...and his Julie.

144
I just want to get over him.
God, why can't I do that?

145
Oy.

146
Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

147
You can't see it because
you haven't had closure...

148
Aah!

149
Closure!

150
That's what it is. That's what I need.

151
God, you're brilliant!

152
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

153
Well, there's no one way
really, it's just...

154
Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

155
"I'm over you. "

156
Over you. That's what it is.

157
Closure.

158
Hello? Excuse me?

159
Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!

160
- Hang on.
- Hello? Excuse me?

161
- What?
- Hi. I'm sorry.

162
I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

163
- I'm talking.
- I see that.

164
It's one phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

165
Okay, you're being a little weird
about your phone.

166
All right. Fine.

167
I'll call you back.

168
Thank you.

169
Okay.

170
Machine.

171
- Just waiting for the beep.
- Good.

172
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

173
I'm just calling to say that, um...

174
...everything's fine.

175
And I'm really happy for you...

176
...and your cat.

177
Who, by the way,
I think you should name Michael.

178
And you see there,
I'm thinking of names...

179
...so obviously I am over you.

180
I am over you.

181
And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure. "

182
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

183
Monica, it's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

184
- Why not?
- Because it's Sunday!

185
It's God's day.

186
Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.

187
Ha, ha, okay.

188
- Stop.
- No, come on! We can't stop!

189
We got three more pounds to go!

190
I am the energy train
and you are on board!

191
Whoo.

192
- Hey, Rach.
- Mm.

193
- Oh. And how was the date?
- Ugh.

194
Um, I think there was a restaurant.

195
I know there was wine.

196
Wow. Well, uh...

197
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

198
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say?

199
What? Why are you
looking at me like that? Heh.

200
Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...

201
I feel like I had a dream
about you last night...

202
...but I don't remember.

203
Okay.

204
Heh. Oh, oh, oh.

205
- There they are.
- Ahem.

206
Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

207
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

208
- Huh.
- Oh, I haven't even been home yet.

209
Do you mind if I check my messages?

210
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

211
Rach, I got a message from you!

212
- Who's Michael?
- Oh, my God.

213
God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

214
Give me the phone! Give me the phone!
Give me the phone!

215
Give me the...

216
You're over me?

217
Oh, God.

218
- Wha...? You're, uh...
- Oh, God.

219
- You're over me?
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

220
Oh, my God. Oh...

221
When...? When were you...

222
...under me?

223
Rach.

224
Rachel, do you?

225
I mean, were you, uh...?

226
Ugh. Okay. Okay, okay.
- What?

227
Well, basically...

228
...ahem, lately, I've, uh...

229
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.

230
You've had feelings for me?

231
Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first.

232
Whoa, huh.

233
You know about my...?
You know I had...?

234
You know?

235
- Chandler told me.
- When did he...?

236
When did he...? When did he?

237
- When you were in China.
- China.

238
- Meeting Julie.
- Julie.

239
Julie. That's... Oh, God.

240
Julie? Julie, right.

241
Okay, I need to lie down.

242
- No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand...
- Okay.

243
...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

244
Okay, so you, uh?

245
And now, what? Now...? Now.

246
Now you're over me?

247
Are you over me?

248
That's... That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.

249
- Hi, Julie.
Honey, I've got a cab waiting.

250
I'll be right down!

251
Wait, so you're going?

252
Well, okay, I, uh... I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

253
I mean, I've, uh... Heh.
You know, I've got a cab.

254
I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

255
Okay. Okay.

256
Cat!

257
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

258
How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

259
I can't find the remote.

260
Ugh, thank you. Heh.

261
So, Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

262
- And?
- And we did.

263
- All right, Pheebs! Way to go!
- Yay, me. Ha, ha.

264
So how did it happen?

265
I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

266
What did he say?

267
He said he understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

268
And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all, you know:

269
"Is he gonna call me the next day?"
And "Where is this going?" and:

270
So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

271
- Wow.
- Yeah.

272
So I said, "Okay. Relax, please. "
You know?

273
I mean, sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

274
If he wants to see me again,
he can call. If not, that's fine too.

275
So after a lot of talking, heh...

276
...I convinced him. Heh!

277
Let me get this straight.

278
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

279
He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

280
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

281
Uh-huh.

282
This man is my god.

283
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.

284
Oh, that's, um, interesting.

285
No. No, it's not interesting.
Okay? It's very, very not interesting.

286
It's actually a hundred percent
the opposite of interesting.

287
I got it, Ross.

288
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

289
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

290
...before I found out about you.

291
I was doing great before
I found out about you!

292
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

293
You should've said something
before I met her.

294
I didn't know then. And how come
you never said anything to me?

295
There was never a good time.

296
You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

297
Not... Not... Not...

298
...every night.

299
It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

300
You know, like Italian guys...

301
...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...

302
Italian guys.

303
There was one Italian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

304
The point is, I don't need this right now!

305
Okay? It's too late.

306
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed!

307
You're just gonna put away feelings
or whatever it was you felt for me?

308
I've done it since ninth grade.
I've gotten good at it.

309
All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that, Ross.

310
I don't need your stupid ship!

311
- Good.
- Good!

312
And you know what? Now I got closure!

313
Try the bottom one.

314
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

315
We're not working out. It's over.

316
No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

317
We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

318
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.

319
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

320
So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

321
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh?
Ha, ha.

322
What? Heh.

323
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

324
Well, thanks.

325
Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

326
Well, you know. Heh.

327
You know, I mean...

328
...you can't tell your parents you were fired,
because they'd be disappointed.

329
Uh-huh.

330
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

331
- Well, no. But I...
- I mean...

332
...if it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

333
You know, I try to stay positive.

334
So you?

335
You feel like going for a run?

336
All right.

337
Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

338
Okay.

339
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.

1
- Ross kissed me.
- No!

2
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

3
It was unbelievable!

4
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

5
We wanna hear everything.

6
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

7
- Okay.
- Rachel.

8
Does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

9
- Oh, it ended very well.
- Oh.

10
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

11
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

12
Was it like a soft brush
against your lips...

13
...or was it like a, you know,
"I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

14
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...

15
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

16
Oh... So, okay, was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

17
No, actually, ahem, first
they started out on my waist...

18
...and then they slid up
and then they were in my hair.

19
- Oh.
Oh.

20
And, uh...

21
And then I kissed her.

22
Tongue?

23
- Yeah.
- Cool.

24
All right, check out this bad boy!

25
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

26
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

27
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

28
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?

29
Games and stuff.

30
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

31
Oh, wait, here's one. Uh...

32
- Would you be willing to cook naked?
- There's an ad for a naked chef?

33
No, but if you're willing to cook naked,
then you might be willing to dance naked.

34
- And then...
- Mm.

35
- Hi.
- Hey.

36
Hey.
- Oh, so how'd you make out last night?

37
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

38
No, wait, wait.

39
Yeah, that's just painful.

40
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

41
Yeah, it was.
But I get home, okay...

42
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

43
...and I think, "Oh, my God.
What the hell am I doing?"

44
I mean, here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

45
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

46
...and am I just gonna
throw all that away?

47
You got all that
from saline solution?

48
Wait a minute. We're talking
about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

49
Believe me, I've been dreaming
about me and Rachel for 10 years.

50
But now I'm with Julie.

51
You know? So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

52
Me and Julie, me and Rach...

53
Rachel! Rachel.

54
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

55
Good. How are you?

56
- Good. Um...
Good.

57
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

58
Julie!

59
Um, how are you?

60
- Good.
Good.

61
So everybody's here.

62
Everybody's good.

63
Were you gonna play something?

64
- Oh. Well, actually...
- Play it!

65
Oh.

66
All right.

67
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
- What?

68
Shh.

69
Okay. Um, hi.

70
Hello. Hi. Okay.

71
So, um... Ahem.

72
This is a song, um,
about a love triangle...

73
...between three people I made up.

74
Um, it's called, um,
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night. "

75
There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

76
And a guy
Let's call him Neil

77
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

78
This story isn't real

79
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside?

80
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly?

81
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie?

82
He must decide
He must decide

83
Even though I made him up
He must decide

84
Well, this is a nice résumé.

85
Nice, nice, nice.

86
Uh, Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

87
Mockolate.

88
- I'm sorry?
- Mockolate.

89
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

90
Ooh.

91
- Well, go ahead, try a piece.
- Oh.

92
Yeah, we think that Mockolate
is even better than chocolate.

93
- All right.
- Ha, ha.

94
Mm.

95
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

96
I love how it crumbles.

97
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
- Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.

98
Anyhoo, we should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

99
Ha-ha-ha.

100
- Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.
- Mm.

101
See, the way we look at it,
chocolate dominates...

102
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

103
- Mm-hm.
- But we think given the right marketing...

104
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Mockolate holiday.

105
Wow.

106
- Aren't you gonna swallow that?
- Ha, ha.

107
- Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
- Oh.

108
Yeah. Isn't that great?

109
- Mm.
Ha-ha-ha.

110
Well, anyhoo, um...

111
...we're looking for chefs who can
create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.

112
You interested?

113
Abso...

114
Ahem.... Lutely!

115
See, I love creating new recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...

116
...I love Mockolate.

117
- Really?
- Mm.

118
Especially that aftertaste.
You know, I tell you...

119
...that'll last you till Christmas.

120
How about Mockolate mousse?

121
It's not...

122
...very Thanksgiving-y.

123
Okay, how about
Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

124
What makes it Pilgrim?

125
We'll put buckles on it.

126
- Hey.
- Hey.

127
- Hey.
- Did Ross call?

128
No, I'm sorry.

129
Why didn't he call?

130
He's gonna stay with Julie.

131
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

132
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

133
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

134
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

135
I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna
do? This is like a complete nightmare!

136
Oh, I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

137
They're both gorgeous and sexy,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

138
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

139
- Hey, here's a thought, Ross...
- Don't ever touch the computer.

140
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

141
Threesome.

142
Right, look. Let's get logical
about this. We'll make a list.

143
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons. "

144
- Oh.
- Oh.

145
We'll put their names
in bold with different fonts...

146
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

147
Can't we just use a pen?

148
No, Amish boy.

149
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

150
Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.

151
I don't know.

152
I mean...

153
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

154
You could say that.

155
Yeah.

156
I guess, you know, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

157
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

158
Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have
a lot in common...

159
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

160
But Rachel's just a waitress.

161
Waitress.

162
Got it.
You guys wanna play "Doom"?

163
Or we could keep doing this.

164
What else?

165
I don't know.

166
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

167
Okay, let's do Julie.

168
What's wrong with her?

169
She's not Rachel.

170
Okay. This is pumpkin pie
with a Mockolate crust.

171
This is Mockolate cranberry cake,
and these are Mockolate-chip cookies.

172
Just like the Indians served.

173
Oh, my God!

174
"Oh, my God" good?

175
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

176
Oh! Ugh!

177
Sweet Lord!
Oh, this is what evil must taste like!

178
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.

179
Yes, I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

180
You know, for a hotline,
you're not so hot.

181
What is that in the background?

182
Are you watching Star Trek?

183
Hey.

184
So how'd it go with Julie?
Did you break her heart?

185
Yes.

186
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

187
Mm.

188
I did the right thing.

189
So Spock actually hugs his father?

190
Hey, do you guys have...?

191
- Hi.
- Hi.

192
Where you going?

193
I just got back from, uh...

194
From Julie's.

195
Oh.

196
No, no.

197
Uh, it's not what you think. Um...

198
It's the other thing.

199
Well, heh, ahem, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

200
Well, uh...

201
He broke up with Julie!

202
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

203
Really?

204
Really.

205
It's always been you, Rach.

206
Oh, God.

207
Oh.

208
Oh.

209
Oh, this is good.

210
- This is really good.
- I know. I know.

211
It's almost...

212
What do you say we go take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

213
- Okay. Let me get my coat.
- Okay. No, hey, whoa, whoa.

214
I'll get your coat.

215
Okay.

216
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

217
Oh, my God, you guys, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

218
- What's that?
What? Nothing!

219
- What? I saw my name. What is it?
- No, no, see? See?

220
Hey, it's printing!

221
What is it? Let me see!

222
Hey, someone order a coat?

223
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me
and he won't let me see.

224
He won't? He won't!

225
Because isn't that...

226
...the short story you were writing?

227
Yes, it is a short story...

228
...that I was writing.

229
And I'm in it? Well, let me read it.

230
No!

231
- Come on!
- Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?

232
All right.

233
"It was summer.

234
And it was hot.

235
- Rachel was there.
- Eh?

236
A lonely gray couch.

237
'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.

238
And then the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

239
That's it? That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

240
This isn't funny anymore.

241
There's something about me
on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.

242
No, you don't.

243
All right, you know what? Fine.
If you guys wanna be children, that's fine.

244
- I do not need to see it!
- Ha!

245
No, no, no!

246
Go, go, go!

247
Ooh.

248
What is this?

249
That is...

250
No, no, no.
Ah...

251
Ross, what is this?

252
Thank you.
Good luck.

253
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

254
"Kind of ditzy"?

255
Ahem. "Too into her looks"?

256
"Spoiled"?

257
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

258
"Just a waitress"?

259
Now, that was, uh...

260
I mean, as opposed to, uh...

261
The, um... Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

262
Ah! I do not have chubby ankles!

263
No! I... No. Rach, Rach...

264
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

265
"She's not Rachem"?

266
- No...
- What the hell's a Rachem?

267
- No, no...
- Is that some stupid paleontology word...

268
...that I wouldn't know
because I'm just a waitress?

269
No. Rach, come on! Rach...

270
Rach! Rach! No, no!

271
It's "She's not Rachel"!
She's not...

272
Rachel?

273
My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!

274
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

275
No, that's true. You'd be a great person
to have around the day after an emergency.

276
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

277
- I know.
- What a dinkus!

278
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

279
- What?
- What?

280
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

281
- This was your idea?
What?

282
Let's get some perspective here, okay?
These things happen for a reason.

283
Yeah. You!

284
All right, Pheebs, back me up here.
You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

285
Yeah. Listen, by the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

286
Rach! Whoa...

287
Rach!

288
Hey! Uh, open up! Please?

289
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away. "

290
That doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape. "

291
I just want to read you something,
your "Pro List. "

292
Not interested.

293
Okay, okay.

294
"Number one:
The way you cry at game shows. Aw.

295
Number two:
How much you love your friends.

296
Number three: The way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

297
Number four: How brave you are
for starting your life over.

298
Number five:
How great you are with Ben.

299
Number six: The way you smell. "

300
What are you doing?

301
Joey, you wanna open the window?

302
Oh, yeah.

303
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm, um...

304
My gosh, you must be freezing.
You know what you need?

305
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Mockolate?

306
Rach, come on, open up.

307
Rach, come on. Come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

308
No.

309
- No?
- That's what I said.

310
Maybe we should go.

311
No, you don't have to go.
We're done talking.

312
Rach, come on.
I know how you must...

313
No, you don't, Ross.

314
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

315
Now, how would you feel if the one person
that you trusted the most in the world...

316
...not only thinks them too...

317
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

318
No, but see, I wanna be with you
in spite of all those things.

319
Oh. Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.

320
I said, don't go!

321
You know what?

322
If things were the other way around,
there is nothing you could put on a list...

323
...that would ever make me
not wanna be with you.

324
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

325
See, I'd never make a list.

326
I never know how long you're supposed to
wait in this situation before you can talk.

327
Maybe a little longer.

328
In some of these recipes,
the quantities may seem a little unusual.

329
Uh, like these coconut Mockolate
holiday nut bars?

330
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of crushed nuts...

331
...and only one tablespoon
of Mockolate.

332
Doesn't matter.

333
What?

334
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

335
Something about laboratory rats.
Huh.

336
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

337
Yeah.

338
Well, anyhoo, here's your check.

339
Thank you for all
you went through.

340
Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

341
Well, I ate some.

342
Oh, some. That's fine. Some's not a lot.

343
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay.

344
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

345
Hello.

346
Hi.

347
Is that him again?

348
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

349
Listen, I don't think this is the best time.

350
Look, can you do something for me?

351
Sure. What?

352
Okay.

353
All right.

354
Music?

355
- Sure.
- Okay.

356
The next one's
dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

357
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

358
...and he hopes you can
find it in your heart to forgive him.

359
See the stone set in your eyes

360
See the thorn twist in your side

361
I'll wait for you

362
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

363
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

364
And I'll wait without you

365
Uh,
we've just gotten a call from Rachel...

366
...and she told us what Ross did.

367
It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

368
...I don't wanna play
your song anymore.

369
Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

370
Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

371
...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

372
There's a room where

373
I can go and

374
Tell my secrets to

375
In my room

376
In my room, in my room

377
In my room

378
Hi.

379
Thanks for coming in again.

380
Oh, not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

381
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Ha-ha-ha.

382
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

383
Now, they taste exactly
like pistachios...

384
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

385
Here, try one.

386
- All right.
- You're not allergic to anything?

387
- Uh, cat hair.
- Oh, sorry.

1
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

3
Oh, my God, you should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

4
Hey.
Hey.

5
How much did you tip the super?

6
Yeah, we were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

7
Oh, this year
we just made him cookies.

8
And 25 it is.

9
Heh. You gave him cookies?

10
- Money is so impersonal.
Yeah.

11
Cookies says someone really cares.

12
All right, we're broke,
but cookies do say that.

13
I can see that.

14
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

15
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these, uh, "funny" brownies?

16
Not especially.

17
But, you know,
I think they had pot in them.

18
So, you guys, who else did you tip
with cookies?

19
Uh, the mailman, the super...

20
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

21
Oh, my God.

22
What?

23
Uh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

24
Oh, wow.

25
Oh, gosh.

26
Oh, these are cookies
smashed in the Sports section.

27
And he did my crossword puzzle.

28
Yeah, but not very well,
unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

29
...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me. "

30
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
You know?

31
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

32
...your lords are a-leaping
and your geese are a-laying. Heh.

33
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

34
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

35
Hey, Rach.

36
I, uh, got you a little present.

37
I'll open it.

38
It's a Slinky!

39
Ha, ha. Remember, huh?

40
Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

41
Everyone knows it's...

42
Just a big spring.

43
You're still mad because of the whole...

44
Horrible list of reasons not to be with me?

45
How about we just call it
"the unfortunate incident"?

46
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

47
- Yeah.
- Go nuts.

48
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

49
What's in the bag?

50
Mm, just some presents.

51
Come on, show us what you bought.

52
You know you want to.

53
Okay.

54
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

55
Oh, that's cute.

56
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

57
And, uh, I got this blouse for Mom.

58
- Ross, that is gorgeous!
- Yeah?

59
Look at these authentic fake medals!

60
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

61
...at the make-believe military academy!

62
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
- Happy Christmas Eve Eve.
- You too.

64
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

65
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

66
This is my father!

67
This is a picture of my dad!

68
Uh, Pheebs, that's the guy
that comes in the frame.

69
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.

70
I thought your dad was in prison.

71
No, that's my stepdad.

72
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

73
How have you never been on Oprah?

74
Look, see? This is him.

75
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

76
Honey, uh, this is a picture
of the frame guy...

77
...posing in front of a blue screen
with a collie.

78
It's not a blue screen. It's just...

79
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

80
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

81
Wait a minute, honey!
Pheebs.

82
Whoa.
Wow.

83
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

84
Joey.

85
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

86
Esther Livingston.

87
Gone!

88
Um... Hi, Pooh.

89
Hi, Gram. Ahem, what you doing?

90
Oh, just updating the phone book.

91
Um, Gram? Um...

92
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

93
Oh.

94
Oh, sure, sure.

95
Uh... Huh, how come?

96
Just, you know, to see him.

97
Oh, sure. Here.

98
All right, uh...

99
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

100
And, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.

101
And here he is at a graduation.

102
Another graduation.

103
Is this really my father?

104
Is it really your...?

105
Well, of course it is.

106
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

107
Well, I...

108
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

109
...you've never lied.

110
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

111
Oh, God.

112
It was your mother's idea.

113
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

114
...because it hurt her so much when he left.

115
I didn't wanna go along with it.

116
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

117
Not impossible, but harder.

118
All right.
So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

119
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma
where there's no phones?

120
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

121
That makes no sense.

122
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

123
Honey.

124
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

125
Anyway, that's all I know.

126
That...

127
...and this.

128
This...

129
...is the real him.

130
Oh.

131
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

132
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

133
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

134
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

135
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

136
Who said anything about Christmas?

137
- Hi.
- Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

138
No, nothing.

139
I hope she's okay.

140
I know exactly what she's going through.

141
How do you know
what she's going through?

142
She told us.

143
What do you got there, Monica?

144
Stuff for the party.

145
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

146
You didn't buy presents yet?

147
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

148
Don't you have to be Claymation
to say stuff like that?

149
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think
the mailman liked your cookies.

150
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

151
Well...

152
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

153
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

154
Hey, Rach. Ahem.

155
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

156
How about you make a list about me?

157
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here...

158
...and make a list.

159
Okay, you're whiny...

160
...you are obsessive, you are insecure...

161
...you're gutless.
- Heh.

162
You don't ever just seize the day.

163
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

164
And, uh... Oh, you wear
too much of that gel in your hair.

165
See, there. You, uh...

166
All right, you did what I said.

167
- And you know what?
- Hmm?

168
You're right. I do feel better.

169
Thank you, Ross.

170
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

171
Okay. Um, in Ithaca?

172
All right, um, Saratoga?

173
Oneonta?

174
You know what?
You shouldn't call yourself Information!

175
Hey.

176
Hello, Grandma.
If that is, in fact, your real name.

177
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

178
- How's it going?
- Oh, not so good.

179
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

180
Well, I think you're better off without him.

181
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

182
But to me,
he's still the irresponsible creep...

183
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

184
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

185
Yeah, I know.

186
Okay.

187
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I told you that, uh, I didn't know...

188
...exactly where he lived.

189
What do you mean?

190
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

191
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

192
You can take my cab.

193
Wow.

194
Thank you.

195
- Nobody else drives that cab.
- Uh-huh. Got it.

196
Oh.

197
- I'm gonna see my dad!
- Ha-ha-ha.

198
- Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

199
Mm, okay. Oh.

200
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

201
Hey.

202
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

203
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

204
Hop in!

205
She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.

206
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...

207
...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.

208
We'll still have plenty of time.

209
- Hey, here she comes!
- Hey.

210
Hey, hey.

211
Hi.

212
Hey.
Hey.

213
Can you believe this?

214
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

215
Yeah, big stuff.

216
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

217
- Here, you have to hold this.
- Okay.

218
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

219
Uh-huh, that's my cheat sheet.

220
- Where's my seat belt?
- That side doesn't have one.

221
The paramedics had to cut through it.

222
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.

224
For the 16th time,
no, I do not think you're obsessive.

225
- Oh, it's hot in here!
Rach, get the heat.

226
- Ross, turn the heat down, please?
- Sure.

227
There's a difference between obsessive...

228
Ross, the heat!

229
Okay. Heat, heat, heat.
And I'm the obsessive one?

230
Okay.

231
This way is on.

232
So this is...

233
...off.

234
Did you just break the radiator?

235
No, I was turning the knob and...

236
...here it is.

237
Well, put it back!

238
It, uh...

239
- It won't go back.
- Ugh. I'll call the super.

240
Here, let me try.

241
Oh, oh, that's right.
I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

242
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

243
...Not Funny!

244
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

245
It's Rachel Green from upstairs.

246
Yes, somebody, uh,
broke our knob on the radiator...

247
...and it's really hot in here.

248
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

249
Well, do you think
we could have a new one by 6?

250
What? No, no. Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

251
We're having a party tonight.

252
Okay, tip the man.

253
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.

254
I won't be blackmailed.

255
Look, if it gets a little warm...

256
...it can be a theme party.

257
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

258
Ooh, this is it.

259
Seventy-four.

260
Oh, so that's what this is for!

261
Wow.

262
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

263
This is, like, the biggest thing ever, huh?

264
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

265
Here I go. I'm going in.

266
All right!

267
Good luck, Pheebs.

268
Okay.

269
Here I go.

270
I'm going.

271
Hi.

272
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party, heh.

273
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

274
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...

275
...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.

276
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

277
Ice?

278
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

279
All right.

280
Monica. Monica!

281
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.

282
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

283
Ha, ha. Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

284
Mr. Treeger.

285
You said there was a party.

286
Oh, yeah.

287
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

288
Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.

289
Probably because I have so much skin.

290
Hey, cheese!

291
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

292
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

293
No, I will not cave.

294
I'm with Mon.

295
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

296
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

297
Mr. Treeger?

298
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.

299
Oh, wow.

300
I didn't get you anything.

301
Here's five back.

302
No, that's your Christmas tip.

303
Oh, do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

304
No can do. Like I told the girl...

305
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

306
- Ross?
Yeah?

307
He's playing baseball.

308
You mean hardball?

309
Whatever.

310
What you gonna do?

311
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

312
Mr. Treeger?

313
Here's another 50.

314
Happy Hanukkah.

315
Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?

316
No.

317
The place is not open till Tuesday.

318
Am I not saying it right?

319
So you really did like my cookies?

320
Oh, yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

321
Nice seizing...

322
...gel boy.

323
So, uh...

324
Is this, uh, mistletoe?

325
No, uh, that...

326
That is basil.

327
- Oh.
- Yeah.

328
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

329
No, it's still basil.

330
Okay.

331
- How far did you get?
- Mailbox.

332
- All right, we're getting closer.
- Uh-huh.

333
What's going on?

334
It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.

335
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

336
And, you know, now he's, uh,
a pharmacist guy and...

337
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

338
Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...

339
...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.

340
I'll go to his pharmacy
and everyone will be nice to me...

341
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

342
So why not go knock?

343
Because, I mean,
what if he's not this great dad guy?

344
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

345
- Yeah.
Hmm.

346
You know what?

347
I've already lost a fake dad this week.

348
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

349
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

350
- Yeah?
Yeah.

351
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

352
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

353
You guys.

354
Sorry about your shopping.

355
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

356
I know you're not going in there...

357
...but do you think it'd be all right
if I went in and used his bathroom?

358
That's fine, never mind.

359
Cool, snow!

360
Kind of like a blank canvas.

361
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

362
You mind if I turn the heat down?

363
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

364
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

365
Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.

366
Honey, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

367
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

368
So that's enough for now.

369
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

370
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

371
The knob was broken...

372
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

373
Rach, these are for you.

374
Wiper blades.

375
I don't even have a car.

376
Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

377
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

378
Toilet-seat covers.

379
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

380
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.

381
You guys!

382
And for Ross...

383
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

384
You got me a cola drink?

385
And a lemon-lime!

386
Well, this is too much. I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

387
And last but not least...

388
They're ribbed for your pleasure.

1
- She totally winked at me!
- She did not wink at you.

2
You always think somebody's
winking at you.

3
Huh.

4
I say "Tupelo Honey"
by Van Morrison.

5
No way!

6
The most romantic song ever
was "The Way We Were. "

7
Ah, I think the one that Elton John wrote
for, um, that guy on Who's the Boss?

8
- What song was that?
- Um.

9
Hold me close, young Tony Danza

10
Hi, Monica.
Hi, Mon.

11
Hey, Mon.

12
Oh, my God!

13
- Has she slept at all?
Nope.

14
It's been three nights in a row.

15
She finally stopped crying yesterday.

16
But then she found one of Richard's
cigar butts on the terrace...

17
Oh. Okay, that explains it.
I got a call at 2 in the morning...

18
...and all I could hear
was this squeaky sound.

19
So I thought,
"Oh, it's a mouse or a possum. "

20
Then I realized, like, okay...

21
...where would a mouse or a possum
get the money to make the phone call?

22
Morning.
- Morning. Hey.

23
You made pancakes?

24
Yeah, like there's any way
I could ever do that.

25
Monica and Rachel had syrup

26
Uh, uh
Now I can get my man to cheer up

27
Good morning, Joey.

28
Good morning.

29
Here's a thought.

30
Why don't you stay home from work
and just hang out with me?

31
Oh, I wish.

32
You have that report to finish,
and I've got to see my lawyer.

33
I can't believe I date
a girl who's getting divorced.

34
- I'm such a grownup.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35
I gotta go, I gotta go.

36
Not without a kiss.

37
Maybe I won't kiss you
so you'll stay.

38
Kiss her. Kiss her!

39
I'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.

40
Bye-bye, Janice.

41
So when are you dumping her?

42
Nope.

43
Not this time.

44
Heh. Come on, quit yanking me.

45
I'm not yanking you.

46
- This is Janice.
- Yeah, I know.

47
She makes me happy.

48
Okay. All right.

49
You look me in the eye and tell me,
without blinking...

50
...that you're not breaking up
with her. No blinking.

51
I'm not breaking up with her!

52
Ah!

53
What's that?

54
God, look what I found in the drain!

55
What?

56
It's some of Richard's hair!

57
What do I do with this?

58
Getting it away from me
would be job one.

59
It's weird, but I don't want
to throw this away.

60
This is all I have left of him.

61
Gross...

62
...drain hair.

63
Ew!

64
Cool! Oh, it looks like a tiny
little person drowning in your cereal.

65
- God, what is wrong with me?
- You need to get some sleep.

66
I need to get some Richard.

67
You broke up with him for a reason.

68
I know. I know.
I'm just so tired of missing him.

69
Tired of wondering why he
hasn't called. Why hasn't he?

70
Maybe because you told him not to?

71
What are you, the Memory Woman?

72
They're not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?

73
They're not breaking up!
He didn't blink!

74
I'm not surprised.
Have you seen them together?

75
They're really cute.

76
"Cute"? This is Janice!

77
You remember Janice?

78
Yes, I remember. She's annoying.
But you know what?

79
She's his girlfriend now.
I mean, what can we do?

80
There you go! That's the spirit
I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

81
Huh?

82
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

83
Chandler's our friend,
and Janice makes him happy.

84
So I say we be adult about it
and accept her.

85
We'll call that Plan B.

86
Honey...

87
...I was wondering...
- Mm.

88
...do you still have
that, um, Navy uniform?

89
No, I had to return it
to the costume place.

90
Oh.

91
I think I have an old band uniform
from high school.

92
You remember not having sex
in high school, right?

93
Yeah.

94
Well, honey, what about you?

95
- What?
- I mean...

96
Do you have any fun, you know,
fantasy-type things?

97
No.

98
Come on. You gotta have one.

99
Nope.

100
- Ross, you know what?
- What?

101
If you tell me, I might do it.

102
Okay.

103
- Ahem.
- Um.

104
Did you ever see, um,
Return of the Jedi?

105
Yeah.

106
Do you remember the scene...

107
...with, um, Jabba the Hutt?

108
Jabba had as his prisoner...

109
...Princess Leia.

110
Oh.

111
Princess Leia was wearing...

112
...this, um, gold bikini thing.

113
It was pretty cool.

114
Yeah, Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Oh, every guy our age loved that.

115
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Mm.

116
It's huge! That's the moment when
she stopped being a princess...

117
...and she became, like, you know,
a woman.

118
Did you ever do the Leia thing?

119
Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

120
Really? That great, huh?

121
No, it's just that I got this new
pager, and I have it on "vibrate. "

122
See you.

123
Hey.

124
Hi, you guys!

125
Look who I found standing
outside the Szechuan Dragon...

126
...staring at a parking meter.

127
- Ahem. Mon. Hi.
- Hi.

128
- Why aren't you at work?
- Oh, they sent me home.

129
Why?

130
Because I don't work
at the Szechuan Dragon.

131
You really need to get some sleep.

132
I know I do.

133
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
Guess what?
They published my paper.

135
- Oh! Really? Let me see, let me see.
- Uh-huh.

136
Rach, look!

137
No.
- Ooh.

138
Hi. Ha, ha.

139
Ha, ha! Oh.

140
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker
to come rescue me?

141
There he is!

142
- Hey.
- Wheel!

143
- Of!
- Fortune!

144
This guy's so stupid.

145
It's Count Rushmore!

146
You should really go on this show.

147
I got three tickets to
the Rangers tonight. What do you say?

148
I say I am there!

149
Cool! Oh.

150
Is Ross going too?

151
No. Janice.

152
Janice?

153
Because I just feel bad for Ross,
you know?

154
We always go together. We're like
The Three Hockey-teers, you know?

155
I may be way out on a limb here,
but do you have a problem with Janice?

156
No!

157
Yes...

158
Oh, God, how do I say this? Uh...

159
Oh! Ah!

160
You know that girl from the
restaurant with the hair?

161
Ooh! That girl that I hate?
Ugh! She drives me crazy. Ew.

162
Oh.

163
Look, I don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?

164
- Well, there you go.
- Oh.

165
Don't look at me like that.

166
She drove you nuts before too,
remember?

167
I'm crazy about her now.
This could be the real thing.

168
Capital R, capital T!

169
Don't worry, those are
the right letters.

170
Look, what do you want me to say?

171
I want you to say that you like her!

172
I can't. It's like this chemical thing,
you know?

173
Every time she starts laughing,
I just wanna...

174
...pull my arm off so
I have something to throw at her.

175
Thanks for trying.

176
Oh, and by the way,
there is no Count Rushmore!

177
Then who's the guy that painted
the faces on the mountain?

178
- Ugh.
- How could you tell her?

179
I didn't think
it would be that big a deal!

180
Oh. She didn't think
it would be a big deal!

181
Who are you talking to
when you do that?

182
Look, that was supposed to be
a private, personal thing between us.

183
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.

184
Guys do the same thing.

185
I mean, what about all that
locker-room stuff?

186
That's different.
That's like, uh, who dated a stripper?

187
Or who did it on the back
of the Staten Island ferry?

188
- Both of those Joey?
- Yeah.

189
But you don't talk about
your girlfriend...

190
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.

191
- Not even with your best friend?
- No.

192
That is so sad.

193
You're missing out on so much.

194
I mean, the bonding and the sharing...

195
...and knowing they're going through
the same thing you are.

196
Oh. So, what, you tell each
other everything?

197
Pretty much.

198
Did you talk about
the Night of Five Times?

199
Do you tell people about
the Night of Five Times?

200
Uh, honey, that was with Carol.

201
I know, but it's still worth
mentioning, I think.

202
Relax every muscle in your body.

203
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

204
Okay, now close your eyes...

205
...and think of a happy place.

206
Tell me your happy place.

207
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

208
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.

209
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

210
Okay, fine. Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.

211
I'll try not to.

212
Okay. All right, so,
you're in a meadow...

213
...millions of stars in the sky...

214
You think breaking up was a mistake?

215
There are no questions
in the happy place.

216
Just the warm breeze and the
moonlight flowing through the trees.

217
I'll bet he's over me.
I'll bet he's fine.

218
Betting and wagering of any kind
are not permitted in the happy place.

219
Okay?

220
There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...

221
...and the trickling fountains...

222
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

223
- Okay, this isn't working.
- Oh.

224
I'm still awake,
and now I have to pee.

225
Oh.

226
So I hear...

227
...you hate me!

228
I, uh, never said hate.
I was very careful about that.

229
A little birdie told me you wanting to
rip your arm off and throw it at me.

230
And you got "hate" from that?
You're taking a big leap there, I, uh...

231
All right, fine, fine, fine!

232
We have got to do something about
our little situation here.

233
So this is my idea.

234
You and me spending
some quality time together.

235
But what does that...?

236
For Chandler!

237
Okay. I'm in.

238
Okay! This is what we'll call it:
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

239
Does it have to be a day?

240
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.

241
Yeah, I know. Ha.
I sleep in the next room.

242
I went down to the post office...

243
...and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered...

244
...for Richard about the Civil War.

245
He loved the Civil War.

246
Do you want us to take you home?

247
Uh-huh.

248
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

249
Women tell each other everything.
Did you know that?

250
Ha, ha. Yeah.

251
No, Chandler, everything.

252
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

253
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

254
Girth?

255
Why? Why? Why?

256
Why would they do this?

257
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...

258
...we ought to be doing it.

259
Uh, do you want to?

260
- We're not gonna talk about girth?
- No.

261
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

262
All right, you go first.

263
- Okay. Okay, I'll go first.
- Okay.

264
So, uh, the other night...

265
...Rachel and I are in bed
talking about fantasies...

266
...and I happened to describe
a particular...

267
...Star Wars thing...

268
- Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
- Yes.

269
- I know!
- Yes.

270
Whoa. Wow.

271
- Well, that was easy. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

272
Okay, you go.

273
- Okay.
- Okay.

274
Okay, you know when you're
in bed with a woman...

275
Uh.

276
...and, uh, ahem, you know,
you're fooling around...

277
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?

278
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?

279
- With the bellybutton ring? Oh.
- Oh! I know.

280
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.

281
And you're, like,
"Mom, get out of here!"

282
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.

283
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...

284
...you know, you know...

285
You don't know!

286
Your mom?

287
You're telling me about your mom?
What's the matter with you?

288
- You said...
- I said "share," not "scare"!

289
Go sit over there!

290
- We're back!
Hey.

291
What are you guys doing together?

292
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

293
- Really?
Yeah, yeah.

294
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.

295
And, uh, you know,
I love this woman. Ha-ha-ha.

296
You have got competition, buddy.

297
Well, I just came by
to give you a kiss.

298
Mwah.

299
I have to go pick up the baby.
So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

300
You too, Chandler.

301
- You still can't stand her, can you?
- I'm sorry, man. I tried! I really did!

302
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

303
But you know, the good thing...

304
...is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived.

305
And what's even more amazing,
so did she. Ha, ha.

306
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

307
I guess that's something.

308
Oh, man, that's huge!

309
Now I know I can stand to be
around her. Which means...

310
...I get to hang out with you.

311
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway. Ha, ha.

312
Okay.

313
Oh, hey! We, uh, stopped by
the coffee shop and, uh, ran into Ross.

314
Oh, God.

315
If it makes you feel any better,
I do it too.

316
Oh.

317
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

318
I always picture your mom
when I'm having sex.

319
April 12, 1861.

320
The United States garrison
at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

321
It is now under bombardment by...

322
Dad, what are you doing here?

323
It's your mother's bridge night, so I
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

324
Oh.

325
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

326
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.

327
So, uh,
what are you really doing here?

328
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

329
Why wouldn't I be okay?

330
I saw Richard.

331
Oh?

332
So how you doing?

333
I'm fine.

334
I'm just a little tired,
but I'm okay.

335
- Ahem. How's Richard doing?
- You don't want to know.

336
No, I really, really do.

337
Well, he's doing terrible!

338
Really?

339
Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

340
- You're not just saying that, are you?
- No, the man is a mess!

341
- Was he crying?
- No.

342
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

343
Maybe.

344
I think so.

345
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

346
You know, after we graduated from
college, we broke up for a while.

347
It seems her father,
your grandfather...

348
...wanted her to travel around Europe
like he did.

349
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

350
...because he was also strafing
German troop trains at the time.

351
However...

352
Okay, here we go.

353
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you...

354
...have a really weird look
on your face.

355
What? Honey, what is it?

356
Did I get the hair wrong?

357
Or what? Did you just
picture it differently? What?

358
No, no. It's, um...
It's not you. It's, um...

359
What is it? Come on, sweetie.
You're, like, freaking me out here.

360
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life!

1
- Hmm. Oh, I don't know.
- What?

2
Well, as old as he is in dog years...

3
...do you think Snoopy
should still be allowed to fly this thing?

4
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

5
Remember when you came, you spent two
weeks getting trained by another waitress?

6
Oh, sure.
Do you need me to train somebody new?

7
Ha-ha-ha. Good one.

8
Actually, uh,
Terry wants you to take the training again.

9
Whenever.

10
Do you believe that?

11
Yeah.

12
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

13
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

14
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

15
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

16
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

17
...is not a backhand.

18
I was shrieking...

19
...like a Marine.

20
All right, here, watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

21
Power, huah...

22
...precision, shew...

23
...and panache.

24
You broke a little girl's leg?

25
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

26
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

27
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?

28
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.

29
- What do you think she'd like?
- Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

30
The ability to walk?

31
I'm gonna get back to retraining. Ahem.

32
All right. See you guys.

33
Look out, kids. He's coming.

34
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.

35
Have fun. Oh, wait. No, don't.

36
I forgot. I am totally against that now.

37
What? Me having a job?

38
No, no. I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

39
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

40
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

41
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

42
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

43
Hey, Phoebe, listen.

44
You got this all wrong.

45
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

46
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

47
Really?

48
Yes.

49
Yes, and, uh, the trees are happy too...

50
...because for most of them,
it's their only chance to see New York.

51
After you've delivered the drinks,
you take the tray...

52
Gunther, Gunther, please.
I have worked here for two and a half years.

53
I know the empty trays go over there.

54
What if you put them here?

55
Huh.

56
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

57
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

58
- They already do.
- Huh?

59
That's why they call it "the tray spot. "

60
I always heard them talk about that.
I just thought it was a club they went to.

61
Oh, God.

62
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

63
Sweetheart.

64
So this must be kind of neat
for you, huh?

65
Your dad tells me
you get a couple of days off school...

66
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

67
Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

68
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

69
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

70
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

71
Yeah. My dad says if I'd spend as
much time helping him clean apartments...

72
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...

73
...he'd be able to afford a trip
to the Taj Mahal.

74
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.

75
No, the one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

76
He says he's gonna double
the college money my grandma left me.

77
Huh.

78
Well, good luck to Dad.

79
Say, how many more boxes
would you have to sell in order to win?

80
- The girl who won last year sold 475.
- Yeah?

81
So far, I've sold 75.

82
Four hundred, huh?

83
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

84
Five dollars a box.

85
And what is second prize?

86
A 10-speed bike.

87
But I'd rather have something
my dad couldn't sell.

88
Well, that makes sense.

89
Could you do me one favor?
If it's not too much trouble.

90
- Yeah, Sarah, anything.
- Could you pull the curtains open for me?

91
The astronauts from the space shuttle
are gonna be on the news.

92
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

93
...said she'd push hers up to her window
so I can watch it.

94
Yes?

95
Yeah, hi. I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.

96
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

97
Um, no, hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

98
What does that mean?

99
Uh, well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

100
I can dial 911 at the press of a button,
you know.

101
Now, go away.

102
Please, please. It's for a poor little girl...

103
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

104
- I'm pressing.
- No...

105
A policeman is on his way.

106
Okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going.

107
- I can still see you.
- All right.

108
Hey.

109
Hey. What are you doing here?

110
Well, I thought a lot
about what you said...

111
...and I realized, all right,
maybe I was a little judgmental.

112
Yeah. Oh, but, oh. Ugh.

113
Now, now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

114
...they're just fulfilling their Christmas...

115
- Destiny. Yes.
- Sure.

116
- Right.
- Okay.

117
Yikes. That one doesn't look
very fulfilled.

118
Oh, that's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

119
You keep the old ones in the back?

120
That is so ageist.

121
- We have to make room for the fresh ones.
- So, what happens to the old guys?

122
Well, they go into the chipper.

123
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

124
No. No!

125
Hey, hey, hey.

126
And these come in the shapes
of Christmas characters.

127
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

128
Oh.

129
All right.
I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.

130
Wait a minute, one box? I'm trying to send
a poor little girl to Space Camp.

131
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

132
All right, do you have any, uh,
coconut-flavored deities?

133
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

134
I'll put you down for eight boxes,
one for each night.

135
Okay.

136
Mon?
- I'll take one box of the Mint Treasures.

137
One, and that's it.

138
I started gaining weight
after I joined the Brown Birds.

139
Remember Dad bought every one
of my boxes and I ate them all?

140
No, Mon, Dad had to buy every one
of your boxes...

141
...because you ate them all.

142
But, you know,
I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.

143
Why don't I just put you down
for three Mint Treasures...

144
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs?

145
No.

146
Oh, come on, now.
You know you want them.

147
Don't do this.

148
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.

149
Oh, God, I gotta go.

150
Come on.
All the cool kids are eating them.

151
And later I wanna show you
why we don't just trap spiders...

152
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

153
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.
My life officially sucks.

154
But wasn't this supposed to be temporary?
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.

155
Well, yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

156
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

157
You know, other than sending out résumés,
like, what, two years ago?

158
Well, I'm also sending out...

159
...good thoughts.

160
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

161
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

162
You need The Fear.

163
- The Fear?
He's right.

164
If you quit this job,
you then have motivation...

165
...to go after a job you really want.

166
How come you're still at a job you hate?
Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

167
Because I'm too afraid.

168
God. I don't know.

169
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

170
Ugh. I just don't wanna be 30
and still work here.

171
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28
and still working here.

172
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

173
Remind me to review with you
which pot is decaf and which is regular.

174
Can't I just look at the handles on them?

175
You would think.

176
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

177
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.

178
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

179
I don't care where the tray spot is.

180
I just don't care.
This is not what I wanna do.

181
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

182
- I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
- What?

183
Gunther, I quit.

184
Does this mean we're gonna have to start
paying for coffee?

185
Okay, 12.

186
Twenty-two.

187
Eighteen.

188
- What?
- I spelled out "boobies. " Ha, ha.

189
Ross, put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

190
Where are the Mint Treasures?

191
Uh, we're out. I sold them all.

192
What?

193
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

194
No. No.

195
Just a couple more boxes.

196
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

197
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes.

198
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

199
Oh, God.

200
- Whoa. So how many you sold so far?
- Ah? Check this out.

201
- Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
- Oh, my God. How did you do that?

202
Ahem. Okay, the other night,
I was leaving the museum...

203
...just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

204
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.

205
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.

206
So I started hitting the NYU dorms
around midnight.

207
I am selling cookies by the case.

208
They call me...

209
..."Cookie Dude. "

210
Okay, stop what you're doing.
I need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers...

211
Oh, hey. Who did these résumés for you?

212
Me, on my computer.

213
Well, you sure used a large font.

214
Uh, yeah.
Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...

215
...and "Cheer Squad Co-captain"
only took up so much room.

216
Heh, heh. Hey, that's funny.

217
You're funny, Chandler.
You're a funny guy.

218
You know what else is really funny?

219
Something else I might have said?

220
I don't know, I don't know.

221
Weren't you the guy
that told me to quit my job...

222
...when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

223
Ha-ha-ha. Huh? Huh?

224
Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.

225
No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

226
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.

227
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...

228
...and I'm gonna tell him I'm not quitting.

229
You don't wanna give in to The Fear.

230
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear.

231
I would like to take you and your Fear...

232
Hey. I got great news.

233
Run, Joey. Run for your life.

234
What? Rach, listen, have you ever heard
of Fortunata Fashions?

235
- No.
- My old man's doing a plumbing job there...

236
...and he heard they have an opening.

237
Want me to see
if he can get you an interview?

238
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
Oh, that's so sweet, Joey.

239
Not a problem.
And now for the great news.

240
- What, that wasn't the great news?
- Only if you think it's better than this.

241
Snow-in-a-Can.

242
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

243
- Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
- Christmas cookie?

244
Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.

245
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

246
Looks good. I'll take it.

247
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
You don't want that one. Uh-uh.

248
No. You can have
this cool brown one. Ooh.

249
It's almost dead.

250
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

251
Otherwise, they're gonna throw it
into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

252
Uh...

253
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny, heh...

254
...are thrown in the chipper.

255
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

256
Pheebs. Heh. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.

257
Hey, guys.
I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.

258
Well, look no further. This one's yours.

259
Ah.

260
Is this the one that I threw out last year?

261
All right, you know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

262
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get so emotional.

263
I guess it's just...
The holidays are just hard.

264
Oh, honey, is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

265
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.

266
Oh.

267
Hi there. How many did you sell?

268
I'm not gonna tell you.
You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

269
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

270
You're a big scrud.

271
What's a scrud?

272
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud?

273
I don't have to. I can just look at you.

274
All right, girls...

275
...and man.

276
Let's see your final tallies.

277
Oh... Debbie.

278
Three hundred and twenty-one boxes
of cookies. Very nice.

279
Not nice enough.

280
Charla.

281
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

282
Sorry, dear, but still good.

283
Good for a scrud.

284
Let's see.

285
Ooh. Yes, Elizabeth.

286
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

287
That's crap.

288
Sister Brown Bird.

289
Good going.

290
Who's next?

291
- Hi there.
- Hi.

292
And batting for Sarah...

293
...Ross Geller.

294
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

295
Although it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

296
Ahem. That is because my doctor
says that I have a very serious...

297
...nougat...

298
...deficiency.

299
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

300
Well, I lost.

301
Some little girl loaned her uniform
to her 19-year-old sister...

302
...who went down to the USS Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

303
Hey. How'd the interview go?
- Oh, I blew it.

304
- I wouldn't have even hired me.
Oh.

305
- Ugh.
- Come here, sweetie.

306
Listen, you're gonna go on like
a thousand interviews before you get a job.

307
That's not how that was supposed
to come out.

308
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

309
Rach, maybe you should just, you know,
stay here at the coffeehouse.

310
I can't. It's too late.
Terry already hired that girl over there.

311
Look at her.
She's even got waitress experience. Ugh.

312
Last night she was...

313
...teaching everybody
how to make napkins into...

314
...swans.

315
That word was "swans. "

316
"Swans. "

317
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself
really perked up my Christmas.

318
Ah! Oh, my God.

319
Merry Christmas!

320
You saved them. You guys.

321
Oh, God, you're the best.

322
Looks like Night of the Living Dead
Christmas Trees.

323
Hello?

324
Yeah, this is she.

325
Oh! You're kidding. You're kidding.

326
Oh, thank you. I love you.

327
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

328
I got the job.

329
- Oh, hey. All right!
- That's great.

330
Oh! God bless us, every one.

331
Here we go.
I'm serving my last cup of coffee.

332
There you go. Enjoy.

333
Yay!

334
- Should I tell her I ordered tea?
- No.

335
- No.
- No.

336
Um, excuse me, everyone?

337
Uh, this is my last night working here...

338
...and I just wanted to say
that I made some really good friends here.

339
And it's just time to move on.

340
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

341
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

342
...that as of this moment...

343
...I will never have to make coffee again.

344
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.

345
So you're gonna use two bags
instead of one, see?

346
Now, pay attention
because this part's tricky.

347
See, some people use filters just once.

348
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

349
...and I'm hoping that maybe somehow,
this may help make up for it. Okay?

350
Presenting...

351
...Sarah Tuddle's Private,
Very Special Space Camp!

352
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

353
Oh, come on. Here we go.

354
Stand by for mission countdown.

355
Ten, ten, ten.

356
Nine, nine, nine.

357
Eight, eight, eight. Ow.

358
Okay, blast off.

359
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

360
Oh, no, an asteroid!

1
Okay, pick a card, any card.

2
All right, now memorize it.

3
Show it to everybody.

4
- Got it?
Mm-hm.

5
All right. Give it back to me.

6
Five of hearts.

7
- Real magic does exist.
- Oh, wow.

8
Wow. Joey, how do you do it?

9
I can't tell you that. No.

10
Uh, somebody's at the door
on the ceiling.

11
Heh. No, that's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

12
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

13
Well, why don't you go up there
and ask him to just step lightly, please?

14
I have, like five times,
but the guy is so charming...

15
...that I go up there to yell,
and I end up apologizing to him.

16
Oh, that is silly.

17
I'll go up there.
I'll tell him to keep it down.

18
- All right, be my guest.
Good luck.

19
All right, all right, all right.

20
If you really wanna know how I did it,
I'll show you.

21
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

22
...I looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

23
I just did it.

24
Just did it again.

25
Here, I'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

26
Oh.
- I got it now. Okay.

27
I was at my friend's downstairs...

28
...and we hear every single thing
that you do.

29
Oh. Ha, ha. Thank you.

30
Hey.

31
Anybody got a length of rope
about 6 feet long with a noose at the end?

32
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I just saw Janice.

33
Aw.

34
She was at Rockefeller Center,
skating with her husband.

35
She looked so happy.

36
I almost feel bad
for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.

37
I remember the first time
I saw that girl Katherine after we broke up.

38
She was walking with her friend Donna,
just laughing and talking.

39
God, it killed me.

40
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

41
Sorry, I just...
Any excuse to tell that story.

42
Hey, Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

43
Oh. You know what? I'm gonna be okay.
You don't have to throw a party for me.

44
It's Joey's birthday.

45
Oh, well, then if anybody
should have a party, it should be him.

46
Shh. I cannot believe she's still up there.

47
Okay, well,
he totally screwed up the punch line.

48
You know, it's supposed to be:

49
- How's that coffee coming, dear?
- Yeah. Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

50
I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
It makes me gassy.

51
I know.

52
I'll bet you're thinking,
"What's an intelligent girl...

53
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?"

54
- Ah? Ah? Ha, ha.
- Oh, ha, ha. You got me. Heh.

55
Don't think I haven't noticed
your potential.

56
Well, I've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

57
- How does that sound?
- Oh. That sounds great.

58
- Come on over here, sweetheart.
- Thank you so much, Mr. Kaplan.

59
I need these hangers separated ASAP.

60
You're welcome.

61
Oh, God, I hate my job.
I hate it. I hate my job.

62
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

63
Oh. I wanna quit,
but then I think I should stick it out.

64
Then I think...

65
...why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

66
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?

67
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

68
Order up. I got a Yentl soup, James Beans,
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

69
Oh. Honey, come on, I'm sorry. I didn't...

70
I don't mind paying my dues.

71
It's just, how much am I gonna learn
about fashion...

72
...by walking Myra,
the arthritic seamstress...

73
...to the bathroom?

74
Hi. Is my misery amusing to you?

75
I'm sorry, I was just, uh... Ha, ha.

76
It's not funny. This is actually my job.

77
Oh, believe me, I've been there.

78
I had to sort mannequin heads
at Mannequins Plus.

79
Oh. Well, then, so I'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

80
You can go back
to enjoying your little hamburger.

81
- Uh, just one other thing.
- Ahem. Yes?

82
I work at Bloomingdale's...

83
...and I might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

84
Do you want my pickle?

85
Hey, guys.

86
- Hey, Gunther.
- Hi.

87
You're going out on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

88
- Well, he's very charming.
- I know, he's too charming.

89
But if you go out, it's gonna make it
so much harder for me to hate him.

90
Well, you're just going to have to try.

91
All right. Joey?
Where are the Jell-O shots?

92
I don't know.
Chandler's supposed to be passing them...

93
- Chandler.
- Hello-dee-lo.

94
Well, somebody's feeling better.

95
- Stick out your tongue.
- Take off your shirt.

96
- Oh, my.
Oh, my God.

97
How many of these did you have?
These are pure vodka.

98
Yeah, Jell-O just like Mom used to make.

99
The most unbelievable thing
happened to me today.

100
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
I'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me...

102
...and he works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's...

103
...and there's an opening in his department.
So I gave him my phone number...

104
...and he's gonna call me this weekend
to see if he can get me an interview.

105
- Wow. Ha, ha.
- I know.

106
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

107
Uh-huh.

108
And he's a total stranger?

109
Yeah. His name is, um, Mark something.

110
Ah. Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex.

111
What?

112
I'm just saying, why else would he just
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

113
To be nice?

114
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

115
- No, only for sex.
- Thank you.

116
So did you tell Mark Something
about me?

117
I didn't have to, because I was wearing
my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...

118
...and ringing my bell.

119
Ah. Uh-huh.

120
Joey! Happy birthday!

121
Hey!

122
Okay, how many of that girl
are you seeing?

123
How hammered are you? Huh?
These are Joey's sisters.

124
Hi, Joey's sisters.

125
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

126
What are we drinking over here?

127
Oh, well, I have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

128
No kidding?

129
That's the exact same drink I made myself
right after I shot my husband.

130
Wow.

131
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.

132
What are you doing?

133
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

134
Aw.

135
No, no, no, it's a good thing.

136
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why must we rush through life?

137
Why can't we savor the precious moments?
Those are some huge breasts you have.

138
- Hi.
- Hi.

139
Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about
this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

140
- Oh, yeah, isn't that great?
- Oh, yeah.

141
So, uh, yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

142
Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.

143
I mean, you know what?
When he left, I actually used the phrase...

144
..."homina, homina, homina. "

145
That's excellent.

146
So he's just a nice guy.

147
You really think this Mark doesn't want
anything in exchange for helping you?

148
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers
with him.

149
But, you know, that's true of any job.

150
Uh-oh.

151
How you feeling?

152
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

153
...because I drank it.

154
Where'd you get to? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

155
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

156
Woo-hoo.

157
- Really?
- Aah.

158
No "woo-hooing. " No "woo-hooing. "

159
Why, what happened?

160
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

161
- Well, that's not the worst part.
- What is the worst part?

162
I can't remember which sister.

163
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

164
This is men.

165
Are you insane?

166
Joey's gonna kill you.
He's actually going to kill you dead.

167
Okay. You don't think I thought of that?

168
- How can you not know which one?
I mean, that's unbelievable.

169
- I mean, was it Gina?
- Which one is Gina?

170
The dark, big hair,
with the airplane earrings.

171
No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina.

172
See? You can't tell
which is which either. Blah.

173
We didn't fool around with any of them.
Blah. Blah.

174
Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

175
I definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat.

176
That was me.

177
Oh. When I've been drinking,
sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.

178
- And I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

179
- That's all right.
That's okay.

180
Can I talk to you for a second?

181
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

182
Come on.

183
Why can't we talk in here,
with witnesses?

184
- I just got off the phone with my sister.
- Uh, which one?

185
- Mary Angela.
- Mary Angela.

186
- Yeah.
- Now, which one is she again?

187
Ask Chandler.
He's the one who fooled around with her.

188
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

189
Now, is that true, or are you just
getting over Janice by groping my sister?

190
It's gotta be the first one.

191
Really?

192
That's great.

193
You and my sister, sitting in a tree.

194
Yep, I'm in a tree.

195
Did he call? Did Mark call?

196
No, honey, I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

197
Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?

198
- Guess they're back from their date.
- Ah.

199
Music. Very nice.

200
Uh-huh. Oh.

201
Oh, my God.

202
So how are you?

203
- I am good. I finished my book.
- Oh, yeah? What's it about?

204
I don't remember.
Do you wanna take a walk?

205
Yeah, I do.

206
"Dear Mary Angela:

207
Hi, how's it going?

208
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write. "

209
What the hell's the matter with you?
How do you think Joey's gonna react...

210
...when he finds out
you blew off his sister with a letter?

211
That's the part where you tell him
that I moved to France...

212
...when actually I'll be in Cuba.

213
All right, look, look,
you've got to do this yourself, okay?

214
In person. At least you know her name.

215
You just go to the house
and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?

216
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

217
...take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

218
Okay.

219
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and I ask for Mary Angela?

220
Where in Cuba?

221
Joey, what...? What are you doing here?

222
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

223
What about you?

224
Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.

225
You are so the man. Come on.

226
Now, look, listen. Listen.

227
You gotta be cool, because my grandma
doesn't know about you two.

228
You do not wanna tick her off.

229
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

230
Yeah.

231
Where's Mary Angela?

232
- She's right in there.
- Okay.

233
Hey, Chandler.

234
I can't believe Mark didn't call.
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

235
Bummer.

236
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

237
No, I'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

238
Look, Rach,
I want only good things for you.

239
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

240
Who says you have to sit here
and wait for him?

241
You've got to make stuff happen.

242
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

243
Honey, it's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

244
Wha...? He gave you his home number,
as in, like, to his home?

245
Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,
because you only want good things for me.

246
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.

247
Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.

248
Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.

249
Yeah, I'll hold.

250
He left my number at work.

251
He was gonna get it, but he was helping
his niece with her report on the pioneers.

252
- Aw.
- That is so made up.

253
Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow?
That's... No, it's perfect.

254
Oh, God. Thank you so much.
Great. Bye.

255
Oh! I got the interview.

256
- Oh, yay!
- There you go.

257
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

258
- Oh, that is amazing.
- Yeah.

259
Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...

260
...I'd expect nothing less.
- I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.

261
High collar and baggy pants say,
"I'm a pro. "

262
Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later.

263
- Woo-hoo!
- Okay.

264
You go get them.

265
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?

266
- What?
- "Why don't you call him?"

267
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her.

268
You know, prep her, as in what you do
before you surgically remove the boyfriend.

269
Are you crazy?

270
Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?

271
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend
out for a meal.

272
Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.

273
This is about Rachel
and something happening for her.

274
- Uh-huh.
Even if you're right.

275
What if he wants to sleep with her?
Does that mean he gets to?

276
- No, but...
- I mean, don't you trust her?

277
Well, yeah...

278
Then get over yourself. Grow up.

279
You grow up.

280
This tiramisu is excellent.

281
- Did you make it, Mary Angela?
- No, I did.

282
Well, it's yummy.

283
So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?

284
Of course. It's her favorite.

285
So, um, hmm...

286
Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

287
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

288
Oh, would you just please...

289
...give me your recipe,
because this is great.

290
It's top-notch.

291
- That dies with me.
- So will I.

292
Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.

293
Oh, no, I was just squinting.
That doesn't mean anything.

294
Just do it.

295
Will you excuse me? I have to, um...

296
Hey...

297
Finally. I thought we'd never be alone.

298
Can I just tell you something?

299
I have not stopped thinking about you
since the party.

300
Mm. Mm.

301
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
Whoa.

302
Uh... Ahem.

303
I just got out of a relationship.

304
And I'm not really in a...
In a commitment kind of place.

305
So? Me neither.

306
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

307
Aah.

308
- You're not Mary Angela?
- No. I'm Mary Therese.

309
This is so bad.

310
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?

311
I am.

312
Oh, it's so bad.

313
- Joey!
No Joey. No Joey. No Joey.

314
- Joey.
- What's going on?

315
You're it. Now run and hide.

316
It's no big deal.

317
Chandler was just kissing me
because he thought I was Mary Angela.

318
What? How could you do that?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?

319
I wasn't sure
which one Mary Angela was.

320
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

321
I was really drunk,
and you guys all look really similar.

322
I say punch him, Joey.

323
- Yeah, punch him.
- Yeah, kick him.

324
We should all calm down...

325
...because, you know,
your brother's not gonna punch me.

326
Are you?

327
Well, that is usually what I would do.

328
But I never thought
you'd be on the receiving end.

329
How could you do this?

330
Joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.

331
But I just want you to know that I would
never soberly hurt you or your family.

332
You're my best friend.

333
And I would never do anything
like this ever again.

334
So what?

335
- I say punch him. Punch him.
- Yeah, punch him.

336
- Come on, punch him.
- No. No. I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

337
- I'll do it.
No, you won't.

338
Look, he knows he did a terrible thing,
and I believe him.

339
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.

340
All right?
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

341
- Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
- All right.

342
- Cookie, now you can punch him.
- What?

343
- Hey.
- Hi.

344
What are you doing here?

345
You know,
this building's on my paper route, so...

346
- Oh. Hi.
Hi.

347
How did it go?

348
Oh, well, the woman I interviewed with
was pretty tough...

349
...but, you know,
thank God Mark coached me.

350
Once I started talking about the fall line,
she got all happy.

351
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too.

352
Listen, I'm, uh...

353
I'm sorry I've been so crazy
and jealous and...

354
It's just, I like you a lot, so...

355
I know.

356
Yeah?
- Yeah.

357
Rachel.
- Yeah?

358
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Mark.

359
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got it. You got the job.

360
- What?
- Oh! I did?

361
Yes.

362
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

363
- Congratulations...
- Oh! Wow.

364
- So, Phoebe.
Hmm?

365
How was your date?

366
Oh, well, you know. Ha, ha.

367
Yeah, I do know.

368
Ick. You were eavesdropping?

369
Eavesdropping?
Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.

370
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
But I really like this guy,
and I think he really happens to like me.

372
- Aw.
- Yay.

373
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

374
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

375
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe.

376
This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking
of a lifetime.

377
But is he a big guy?

378
We'll all go. Come on.

379
- Thanks, you guys. Thank you.
Don't worry.

380
God. I hope they kick his ass.

381
Honey, I'm sorry.

382
You know, if it's any consolation...

383
...he really did sound
like he was having more fun with you.

1
Okay. Hey.

2
- Does everybody hate these shoes?
Oh, yeah.

3
But I don't think anybody's gonna focus on
that as long as you wear that towel dress.

4
Tell him.

5
It's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.

6
All right. I suppose I can wait a day.

7
- Hey, what are you doing Friday?
- Why?

8
I need you to come to this bachelor party
for my weird cousin Albert.

9
You know, he's the botanist?

10
Oh, God. Yeah, botanists are such geeks.

11
Yeah.

12
Is that a dinosaur tie?

13
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

14
- Morning.
Hey.

15
Hey. Rach, I'm here with the purses.

16
It must take you forever
to find your keys.

17
Thank you, thank you, Pheebs.

18
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh, please want the one with the turtles.

19
No, no, no, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.

20
Honey, just relax. It's gonna be fine.

21
Hey, why don't I come down there
and take you to lunch?

22
Aw, honey, thank you,
but Mark's taking me out.

23
Mark? Is that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

24
Yeah. It's kind of like a
"good luck on your first day" sort of thing.

25
Is this actually a lunch box?

26
Um, no, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

27
Oh.

28
- Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
What?

29
Oh, yeah, I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?

30
- Apparently, Albert has no friends.
Oh.

31
He's excited about the bachelor party,
though.

32
I think the only reason he's getting married
is so he can see a stripper.

33
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so cliché.

34
Why don't you guys get a magician?

35
If a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.

36
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

37
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job.

38
And he's really good-looking.

39
- What am I gonna do?
- You don't do anything.

40
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

41
Don't cry out loud.

42
Yes! Unh!

43
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical.

44
I wanna say you,
but it seems like such an easy answer.

45
It is me.

46
It's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

47
So I think I'm gonna sing
"New York, New York"...

48
...and, uh, oh,
"I Left My Heart in San Francisco. "

49
Uh, Joey, I don't think
you get to pick the cities.

50
- What?
- Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

51
Who?

52
I'll get you the CliffsNotes.

53
The what?

54
The abridgment.

55
Oh, okay. Ha, ha.

56
The what?

57
Then the style number...

58
...the invoice number,
and the shipping date.

59
Good. Any questions so far?

60
Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?

61
- Ha, ha. Twenty percent.
- Oh. I love this job. Ha, ha.

62
- Ah! My first call.
- Here, let me.

63
Okay.

64
- Rachel Green's line. How may I help you?
- Hi, is Rachel there?

65
- And who may I say is calling?
- This is Ross.

66
Ross of?

67
Of "Ross and Rachel. "

68
Oh. Hi, it's Mark.

69
- Oh, hey, Mark. Heh. Hey.
Hey.

70
- Hey, hold on a second.
- Uh, okay.

71
It's Ross.
Okay.

72
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

73
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

74
Oh, he's just goofing around.

75
Oh, that's funny.

76
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

77
Ha, ha. Honey, this is his office too.
I told you, we're Joanna's two assistants.

78
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

79
How lazy is she?

80
- Oh. Oh, my God. What did I just do?
- What?

81
I think I just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel.

82
Honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you.

83
Okay. Bye-bye.

84
Ow! Ross!

85
Huh? Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to...

86
Uh, I was dialing another number.

87
All right, I just got changed in 30 seconds
so you could be alone with him.

88
- You better go for it.
- Please. I'm not going for anything.

89
- Well, if you don't, I will.
- Would you please go?

90
Night, Mon.

91
- Night, Julio.
- Adiós.

92
Look, Julio,
someone left their book here.

93
Actually, that is mine.

94
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

95
What are you reading?

96
Flowers of Evil by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

97
Ha, ha. Have I read it?

98
No. Are you enjoying it?

99
I thought that I would,
but the translation's no good.

100
You're a poet and you don't know it.

101
Actually, I, uh... I am a poet.

102
Oh. Ha, ha.

103
So you do know it. Ha, ha.

104
Ahem. So, uh, what kind of things
do you write about?

105
Things that move me.

106
The shadow of a tree...

107
...a child laughing...

108
...or this lip.

109
Mine?

110
Right here?

111
I could write an epic poem about this lip.

112
How would that go?

113
Well, it didn't rhyme, ha, ha...

114
...but I liked it.

115
You've got to pick a pocket or two, boys

116
You've got to pick a pocket or two

117
Lovely. Just lovely.

118
Really? Thanks.

119
Listen, Joey, we definitely wanna see you
for the callback on Saturday.

120
Excellent.

121
- I'll be there.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

122
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

123
Uh, my agent said
that it wasn't a dancing part.

124
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.
Ha, ha.

125
But believe me, with your
dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.

126
Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp?

127
Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre?

128
Hey, everybody lies
on their résumé, okay?

129
I wasn't one of the Zoom kids either.

130
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

131
Yeah, I can dance. You know:

132
Oh, no, no, no.

133
What is that?

134
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

135
All right, I have to get that. But no, no.

136
Hello?

137
Hi. Ha, ha.

138
Yeah, listen, I'm in need of a stripper,
and I was told that you do that.

139
Let me ask you this.
What do you do for the extra hundred?

140
So would I have to provide the grapes?

141
- Hi.
- Ooh.

142
How was last night with Julio, señorita?
Ha, ha.

143
It was so amazing.

144
He's so sexy and smart,
which makes him even sexier.

145
Oh, my gosh.
Last night we were fooling around...

146
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

147
Get out.
I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.

148
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.

149
Well, sure. You name a kid that,
what do you expect them to grow up to be?

150
Ahem. Anyway, when he left
he forgot to take the poem with him.

151
Now, I am totally dense about poetry,
but I think this is pretty good, all right?

152
Check it out. Read it.

153
"The Empty Vase. "

154
Translucent beauty...

155
To yourself.

156
- Hey, you know, that's pretty good.
- Yeah, I think so too. Phoebe?

157
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, great. I'm so glad you guys like it.

158
- Yay. All right, I gotta go to work.
- No, no. I'm not done.

159
Give it back when you're through.

160
- Okay, see you guys.
- Bye-bye.

161
Bye.

162
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Poor Monica.

163
- What? What? What?
What?

164
He was with her
when he wrote this poem. Look.

165
My vessel so lovely
With nothing inside

166
Now that I've touched you
You seem emptier still

167
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase.

168
- You really think that's what he meant?
- Totally.

169
Oh, God.
Oh, and she seems so happy too.

170
Done.

171
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

172
Oh, yeah, sure. It's, uh right...

173
What's that?

174
Uh, it's from Ross. It's a love bug.

175
Wow. Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

176
Oh, no. No, no, no.
That's not what he's doing.

177
- He's just really romantic.
- Okay.

178
Excuse me. Are you Rachel Green?

179
Yes, I am.

180
One, two, three.

181
Congratulations on your first week

182
At your brand-new job

183
It won't be long
Before you're the boss

184
And you know who will be there
To support you

185
Your one and only boyfriend

186
It's nice to have a boyfriend.

187
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross
Ross!

188
I'm hurt. I'm actually hurt...

189
...that you'd think I'd send you those things
out of anything other than love.

190
Hurt.

191
- Hurt.
- All right, Ross, I get it. You're hurt.

192
Can't a guy send a barbershop quartet
to his girlfriend's office anymore?

193
Oh, please. Ross, it was so obvious.

194
It was like you were marking
your territory.

195
I mean, you might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk.

196
I would never do that.

197
Look, I know
what's going on here, okay?

198
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

199
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

200
Mark's a genius.

201
- Why? How? How is he a genius?
- Look, don't you see what's happening?

202
Instead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidant.

203
Now he's gonna be the guy that she goes to
to complain about you.

204
What am I gonna do?

205
Well, why don't you send her
a musical bug?

206
Oh, no, you already did that.

207
All right, look, you're gonna have to
go there yourself now, okay?

208
- Make a few surprise visits.
- I don't know, you guys.

209
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit here and talk to us.

210
Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe-Sensitive.

211
She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the guy
for me because he understands me. "

212
And before you know it, she's with him.

213
And you'll be all, "Oh, man. "

214
And he'll be all, "Yes!"

215
And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude. "

216
And pretty soon you'll be like:

217
"Hi. "

218
And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there. "

219
And we'll be like,
"Man, get over it. It's been four years. "

220
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?

221
Here's the Shelli Segal stuff
for December.

222
- Oh, wait, I've got something for you.
- What? Oh... Mark.

223
It's okay. Rachel knows.

224
Yeah, but even so... Ha, ha.

225
I can't help it. I'm just crazy about you.

226
Oh, that is so sweet.

227
Okay, okay.

228
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

229
I see you walking around,
and I just wanna touch and hold you.

230
- Aw.
- Come on, no one's around. Just kiss me.

231
- All right, that's it. Get off. Get off of her.
- What is going on?

232
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

233
Ross.

234
I have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

235
What do I have to do
to get some service?

236
Hi, Rach.

237
Uh, Joey? Joey Tribbiani?

238
Listen, Joey, I got a problem.
I just got a call from my dance captain.

239
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long Island.

240
So does that mean the audition's off?

241
Listen, Joey,
seeing as you've got the most experience...

242
...I want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.

243
What?

244
Oh, Joey, come on, it's easy.

245
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head...

246
...up, pas de bourrée, pas de bourrée...

247
...big turn here, rond de jambe,
sissonne, sissonne...

248
...slide, step, step...

249
...and jazz hands.

250
So that's steppity-step and jazz hands.

251
Have fun.

252
Bye.

253
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
- What are you wrapping?
- Oh.

255
Look what I got Julio.

256
- Yeah, it's a vase.
- Yeah.

257
Just like the one in the poem.

258
Yeah, well,
not exactly like the one in the poem.

259
What do you mean?

260
Remember how you said
you were really dense about poetry?

261
Yeah.

262
Oh.

263
- So I'm just an empty vase, huh?
- What?

264
So I don't read as many important books
as you do.

265
I don't write poems that seem to be about
one thing but are about something else.

266
And you know what?
I get excited about stupid stuff...

267
...like when my People magazine comes
on Saturday...

268
...and the new Hold Everything catalog.

269
But that does not mean I'm empty.

270
I care about things.
I care about my friends and family.

271
You have no right
to make that judgment about me.

272
- You don't even know me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

273
The poem is not about you.

274
- What?
- "The Empty Vase" is not about you.

275
My baby preciosa.

276
You make me so sad
that you would think this.

277
- I'm sorry. It's... My friend Phoebe said...
No, it's...

278
It's about all women.

279
Well, heh, all American women.

280
You feel better now?

281
Oh, yeah.

282
All right, let's do it.

283
No, no, no.

284
What was that?

285
I know,
it's the best I could get out of them.

286
- Well, people.
- People, people, people.

287
Let's try it again.
And this time, let's everybody watch Joey.

288
Show them how it's done.

289
Count it off, Mack.

290
So did you have fun
at the bachelor party last night?

291
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Look what I got.

292
- See, she's fully dressed, right?
- Right.

293
And then you click it and,
uh-oh, she's naked.

294
And then you click it again
and she's dressed.

295
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.

296
She's window shopping,
and, oh, oh, oh, she's naked.

297
Hi.

298
Hello.

299
You know what? I'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.

300
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

301
- A big idiot.
- A big idiot. Heh.

302
It's just, you have to realize,
this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.

303
Honey, why is it hard?
We've been together for almost a year now.

304
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years,
and I lost her.

305
And now, if it's possible,
I think I love you even more.

306
So it's hard for me to believe
I'm not gonna...

307
Well, that someone else
isn't gonna take you away.

308
Let it be me. Let it be me.

309
Honey, that's very sweet.

310
It just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...

311
...and trust each other, like we do...

312
...there's no reason to be jealous.

313
I gotta get going. Bye, Chandler.

314
Oh, okay, Ross.

315
Listen, this pen's getting kind of boring,
so can you pick me up some porn?

316
- Where you going?
- I've gotta go pick up Ben.

317
We've got a playdate this afternoon.

318
Oh. With who?

319
Just this woman I met last night
at the party.

320
There was a woman at?

321
The stripper?

322
Yeah.

323
You have a playdate with a stripper?

324
Man, I gotta get a kid.

325
Uh, yeah, yeah.

326
We started talking after she,
you know, did her thing...

327
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

328
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

329
- Meh.
Oh.

330
- Is that okay?
- Sure. Is she married?

331
- No.
- Huh.

332
Are you jealous?

333
No. You know, I just don't see why
she has to play with you, that's all.

334
I mean, doesn't she, you know...

335
...have any other stripper-mom friends
of her own?

336
- You are totally jealous.
- Ugh. I'm not jealous, all right?

337
This is about...

338
...um, people feeling certain things...

339
...you know, about...

340
...strippers.
- Oh.

341
- And, you know... And, um... I... Ugh.
- Honey, I love you too.

342
- Bye.
- Wait, wait, wait.

343
What?

344
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours, you know?

345
- Yeah.
- Ha, ha.

346
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him off to a stripper.

347
Is there a Julio here?

348
I am Julio.

349
Mr. Pretentious

350
You think there's no one finer

351
Well, your poems are unpublished
And you work in a diner

352
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

353
You are just a butt-munch

354
No one likes a butt-munch.

355
And you're also bad in bed

1
Hey.

2
Six dollars, please.

3
Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.

4
Eight o'clock is the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

5
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
Look, you're gonna have to help me
out here because I only have 3.

7
I can help with that.

8
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
- Hi.
- Hi.

10
Wow. Your lip went bald.

11
Thanks.

12
So you look great.

13
Yeah, right. Ha, ha.

14
No, you do. You...

15
- You just... You...
- What?

16
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...

18
...and static cling. Ha, ha.

19
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...

20
...and saw an opportunity.

21
It's good to see you.

22
It's good to see you too.

23
- See that guy? He's in "Classics" now...
- Who?

24
...but you know as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

25
He's gonna go up to the counter
with Citizen Kane...

26
...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
- Ha, ha.

27
This is nice.

28
- Ha, ha. Yeah.
- I miss this.

29
Me too.

30
So you wanna get a hamburger
or something?

31
Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

32
No. Just friends. I won't grope you.
I promise.

33
Yeah, I think it's too soon.

34
No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.

35
Yeah, baby.

36
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

37
No, thanks. I'm 29.

38
Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.

39
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

40
I don't know, honey.
It could be really late.

41
Oh, come on. Not again.

42
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?

43
- Mm.
- Every night that you're asleep...

44
...before I get home from work...
- Yeah.

45
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

46
Well, now, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

47
Thank you.

48
- Hi.
Hey, Pheebs.

49
- Hi.
Hey.

50
Look at you.
Since when do you Rollerblade?

51
Oh. Since tomorrow.

52
I met this really cute guy in the park.

53
And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

54
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts ofjock stuff.

55
- And what are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna let him.

56
- Okay.
- Cool.

57
- Morning.
Hey.

58
- Somebody got in late last night.
Ahem.

59
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

60
- When did this happen?
- Oh, um, around 8:02.

61
And we, uh, talked for a little while...

62
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

63
Oh, there's no such thing
as an innocent burger.

64
Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

65
Monica, what are you doing?

66
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...

67
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

68
It's not a date, okay?

69
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

70
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...

71
...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Mm.

72
We're not gonna have sex.

73
Okay? Nothing's changed here.

74
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.

75
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

76
Naked friends.

77
- Hey. Do you have any ice?
- Hey.

78
Check the freezer.

79
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

80
Are you just getting home from work?
It's late.

81
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

82
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.

83
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.

84
How was your day?

85
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth
using just my tongue.

86
Hmm.

87
Um...

88
Why do you have a copy of The Shining
in your freezer?

89
Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so...

90
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

91
Well, safer.

92
I never start reading The Shining...

93
...without making sure
we got plenty of room in the freezer.

94
- You know?
- Ha, ha.

95
How often do you read it?

96
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

97
Well, um, I guess I read Little Women
more than once.

98
But that's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?

99
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about The Shining?"

100
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing. "
All right?

101
This is, like, the scariest book ever.

102
I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

103
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

104
Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?

105
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

106
- All right, you got it.
- All right?

107
- Okay.
- Okay.

108
- Uh, now, Rach, these little women...
- Yeah.

109
How little are they?

110
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

111
- Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.
Oh, hey.

112
- Hi.
- You have lipstick right here.

113
- Oh.
- Huh. That's okay, it's mine.

114
We just kissed.

115
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

116
Well, I'm from California.

117
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

118
I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

119
Anybody, uh, want anything?

120
- I'll have coffee.
- Yeah, me too.

121
Yeah, make that three.
- Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?

122
Okay. Ha, ha.

123
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

124
Robert's coming out.

125
What do you mean? What, is he gay?

126
No, he...

127
He's coming out of his shorts.

128
What?

129
The man is showing brain.

130
Are you sure? Hold on.

131
Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

132
Coffee. We could write it down.
- Okay.

133
No, no. That won't be, uh...
Won't be necessary.

134
- Well?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
What do we do? What do we do?

136
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

137
Like an eclipse.

138
When people compliment me
on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

139
Well, you say, "Thank you very much. "
And then you buy me something pretty.

140
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

141
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

142
Ooh, this feels very weird.

143
Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day
and this feels weird?

144
Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.

145
But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

146
That's my hand.

147
Oh.

148
- Okay.
- Gotta keep squishing.

149
The tomatoes are squishing.

150
- Oh, yeah. Oh.
- Oh.

151
Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.

152
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second.

153
Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

154
It should, um, do...

155
...the trick.

156
What?

157
Um, you've got some on your pants.

158
I'll just throw them out.

159
These little women.

160
Wow.

161
You're liking it, huh?

162
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

163
I don't see how
he could ever forgive her.

164
Um, Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

165
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

166
Oh.

167
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

168
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

169
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

170
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

171
- Hey.
- Hey.

172
Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?

173
Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

174
You mean a 3-pointer?

175
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.

176
So, um, is there a phone here
I can check my messages?

177
- Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
- Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.

178
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

179
Hello.

180
- Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met.
Hi.

181
- Uh, good to meet you. Robert.
- Okay.

182
What?

183
What? You guys, what is going on?

184
Do you not like Robert?

185
Why are you laughing?

186
Calm down. No reason to get testy.

187
- You guys. Come on.
- We're sorry.

188
It just seems that Robert isn't
as concealed in the shorts area...

189
...as, uh, one may have hoped.

190
How do you mean?

191
Hey.
- Hey.

192
Uh, Robert? Could you, uh,
pass me those cookies?

193
Sure.

194
So how'd the lasagna go over?

195
Really? Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.

196
Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.

197
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

198
What...? It's a word.

199
Yeah. I do think it's better this way.
Yeah, we're being smart.

200
Yes, I'm sure.

201
You really sure?

202
I'll call you back.

203
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

204
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

205
Like racquetball.

206
Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.

207
So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...

208
...um, do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

209
Just your dad.

210
Although that's actually racquetball.

211
You know, I do have a blind date...

212
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

213
Do you want me to cancel it?

214
No.

215
- No.
- Yeah.

216
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

217
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

218
Hey.

219
Hey. Oh, don't sit down.

220
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- You bet.

221
And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.

222
Oh, wow.

223
- Hey.
- Stretchy pants?

224
Well, those are the greatest things
in the world.

225
If I were you, I'd wear them every day,
every day.

226
Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

227
But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

228
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

229
I'm sorry.

230
That's all right. I'll figure...

231
Hey.
- How you doing?

232
- How's it going?
- Good.

233
- Good.
Hey, Rach?

234
- How you doing with The Shining?
- Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.

235
Ooh. The next part's the best.
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

236
No, no, no. Come on.
You're gonna ruin it.

237
All right, I'll talk in code.

238
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

239
- Yeah, that's very cool.
Yeah.

240
Ooh. All blank and no blank
makes blank a blank-blank, right?

241
Oh, no, no. No, the end.

242
When Jack almost kills them all
with that blank...

243
...but then in the last second
they get away. Aw.

244
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

245
I can't believe she cracked your code.

246
All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no...

247
...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.

248
Hey.

249
Mine was by accident.

250
All right.

251
The boiler explodes and destroys
the hotel and kills the dad.

252
Beth dies.

253
Beth...? Beth dies?

254
Mm-hm.

255
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

256
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

257
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've just ruined...

258
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

259
No. She doesn't die.

260
Then why would you say that?

261
Because I wanted to hurt you.

262
Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

263
Got them.

264
Hi.

265
Sorry. I'm sorry.

266
You would not believe my day.

267
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

268
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

269
What are you smiling at?

270
Sorry, I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

271
Hello.

272
I love this friend thing.

273
Listen, Robert's gonna be here
any second...

274
...so could one of you just tell him?

275
- Oh.
Please, right now.

276
No, every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

277
We can't tell him.

278
You can't go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his...

279
...stuff.

280
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

281
- Hey.
Hey.

282
So you ready for the gym?

283
They've got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

284
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

285
What?

286
Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert...

287
- Hey, don't we have to?
- Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.

288
Um...

289
I think you're really, really great.

290
Oh, God. Here we go again.

291
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

292
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

293
I don't know what to say.

294
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

295
Ow.

296
Really? Well, it's just like
everyone else's apartment.

297
It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.

298
I just wanted to see
where you live. Now give me the tour.

299
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

300
Uh, this is the living room.
That's nice.

301
All right.

302
- And this is the kitchen.
That's real pretty.

303
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

304
The bedroom.
Well, it's pretty much your typical...

305
...bedroom.
- Oh, ha, ha.

306
- We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha.
- Mm-hm.

307
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.

308
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

309
So, um, who is she?

310
Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date
I told you about.

311
- She called and switched it from Tuesday.
- Aw.

312
Did you like her?

313
And I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

314
Well, you seem fine.

315
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

316
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

317
She wants to see your bedroom.

318
You know what?

319
What if we're friends...

320
...who don't see other people?

321
You mean like exclusive friends?

322
Why not?

323
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

324
Would it be so terrible?

325
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

326
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

327
...and vowed to be friends forever.

328
Wow.

329
You know, we're back where we were.

330
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

331
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

332
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

333
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

334
You know what?

335
I gotta walk out of here right now.

336
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

337
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

338
I know I couldn't.

339
Yeah.

340
So...

341
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

342
- Watch the thorns.
- Ow.

343
What?

344
Beth is really, really sick.

345
Oh.

346
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

347
- Joey?
- Yeah?

348
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

349
Okay.

1
'Cause every time I see your face

2
I can't help but fall from grace

3
Wow. This girl's good.

4
Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words.
Ooh, I never thought of that before.

5
I like her.

6
Why? Because she can sing
and play guitar...

7
...and do both at the same time?

8
Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for
from these people.

9
Look at you, all jealous.

10
Yeah, Pheebs, come on.
You two have completely different styles.

11
You know, she's more... you know?
And you're more:

12
Say you'll stay beside me

13
Okay. See? See?
Everybody else is happy she's done.

14
Okay, my next song's called:

15
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Really Loved When We Were...

16
...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way. "

17
Oh, no. One of those
look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.

18
Hey, Phoebe.

19
Hey, Leslie.

20
How'd you know I'd be here?

21
I ran into Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish...

22
...and he said you played here a lot, so...

23
All right. I have to go to the bathroom.

24
But if the place with the big fish
comes up again...

25
...I'd like to know whether that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

26
So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

27
Actually, I said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

28
Uh, anything we might've heard of?

29
Uh, yeah, um...

30
Home is never far away

31
Home is Homestar Stew

32
Yeah, but I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.

33
And then I couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

34
Hmm, bummer.

35
Well, you know, I was just...

36
Um, I was just thinking
and just hoping that...

37
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

38
No, but thanks.

39
Oh, come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

40
Okay.

41
No, but thanks.

42
Okay, uh...

43
See you, Pheebs.

44
Wow. That was kind of brutal.

45
Well, okay.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

46
All right? Once you betray me,
I become like the Ice Woman.

47
You know, I'm just very cold,
hard, unyielding.

48
You know, nothing, nothing
can penetrate this icy exterior.

49
Can I have a tissue, please?

50
Oh, yes.

51
Is someone in there?

52
No. This is just part
of a daredevil game...

53
...that I play called "Wait Until
the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die. "

54
Jeez, man. Did you fall...? Hi.

55
So, uh, did you? Did you fall high?

56
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.

57
- I left the lid up for you, though.
- Ha, ha.

58
You know what, uh, Gunther?
Go, uh... Go ahead.

59
I'm talking to, uh...

60
This is the part
where you say your name.

61
- Ginger.
- Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...

62
- Don't you have to use the bathroom?
- No.

63
No, I just, uh...
I'd rather, uh, talk to you.

64
Yes, I do.

65
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

66
Someone in here.

67
- Where's Chandler?
- He can't make it.

68
He said he had to go back
to his, uh, job to do, uh...

69
Uh-oh.

70
Joey?

71
Joey Tribbiani?

72
Joey, I can see you, okay?

73
You're hiding behind the coats.

74
Close one. Heh.

75
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

76
Hello.

77
Hey, Ross.

78
Uh-huh.

79
- I've got some bad news.
- What?

80
I can get a quick bite,
but I have to come back here.

81
Come on, sweetie. You've worked late
every night for the past two weeks.

82
- What is it this time?
- It's kind of my fault. I quit today.

83
But work comes first.

84
Oh, hey. But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

85
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

86
No, he's leaving for a better job.

87
Oh, well, that's great.
So I guess this is, uh, goodbye then.

88
Goodbye. Ha, ha.

89
- Okay, then.
- Okay.

90
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

91
Yeah, me too.

92
- So see you on Saturday.
- Yeah, you bet.

93
Ugh.

94
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in India.

95
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again
to see if we can get back together.

96
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

97
Wow. She must've hurt you
pretty bad, huh?

98
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

99
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

100
You two must've been so cute
running around on a barge.

101
You never run on a barge.

102
- Hey.
Hey.

103
Is, uh...? Is Chandler around?

104
No, um, he met some girl
at the coffeehouse.

105
Ooh.
- Yeah. Ginger something.

106
No.

107
No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't
something that sounded liked Ginger?

108
Like, uh, "Gingeer"?

109
No, it was Ginger.

110
I remember because
when he told me, I said:

111
The movie star

112
Oh, man.

113
That's the girl I was hiding from.

114
When she finds out he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what I did.

115
- What did you do?
- Oh. Oh, no, no. I can't...

116
I can't tell you that.
It's like the most awful, horrible thing...

117
...I've ever done in my whole life.
- You know what? Don't tell us.

118
We'll wait till Chandler gets home
because it'll be more fun.

119
All right.

120
Okay, it was, like, four years ago.

121
Okay, Ginger and I had gone out
a few times. Then one weekend...

122
...we went to her dad's cabin...

123
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.

124
Well, that night I cooked
this really romantic dinner...

125
You gave her food poisoning.

126
I wish. No.

127
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
all fell asleep in front of the fire.

128
Well, I woke up in the middle of the night
and I saw that the fire was dying out...

129
...so I picked up a log and threw it on.

130
Or at least what I thought was a log.

131
Oh, my God.
You threw Pepper on the fire.

132
I wish.

133
See, I guess another thing I probably
should've told you about Ginger...

134
...is that she kind of has a, uh...

135
...artificial leg.

136
Oh, my God.

137
Joey. What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

138
I ran.

139
Well, that's the best kiss I've had...

140
...with anybody I met in a men's room.

141
Actually, me too.

142
Oh. Foot in a puddle.
Foot all in the puddle.

143
Oh, damn. I hate that.

144
We're gonna have to get you
out of those shoes.

145
Oh, don't worry about it.

146
- No, really. You're gonna freeze.
- No, I'm not.

147
Huh. You're not?
What do you got, a bionic foot?

148
Someday. Maybe.

149
Funny book?

150
Hmm? Oh, no, no. I'm just thinking about
something funny I heard today.

151
Um, Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday. "

152
Yeah, at the lecture.

153
I told you that last week.
You said you didn't mind.

154
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not the lecture, uh, I mind. Um...

155
Oh, please tell me it's not because
I'm going with Mark.

156
- Well...
- Oh, my God. Ross.

157
Well, I'm sorry, but... Look,
if you're not working with him anymore...

158
...why do you still have to do stuff
with him?

159
Because he's my friend.

160
Okay. But do you really need
another friend? I mean...

161
Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

162
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?

163
I don't know. You thought
"See you Saturday" was funny.

164
Look, honey, Mark is in fashion, okay?

165
I like having a friend
that I can share this stuff with.

166
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

167
I would love to go with you.

168
- Really?
- Yeah.

169
Hey, I have clothes. I even pick them out.

170
I mean, for all you know,
I could be a fashion...

171
...monger.

172
Okay. Honey, I would love for you
to go with me.

173
What?

174
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.

175
You know, they say,
"A watched pot never beeps. "

176
It's, you know, ahem...
It's been a couple hours...

177
...and she hasn't called.

178
Not that I even care. I don't.

179
Phoebe, why don't you just call her?

180
You obviously want to.

181
You think you know me so well.

182
- Well, don't you wanna?
- Yeah.

183
- Okay, so I do know you.
- That's what I said.

184
- Well, so?
- I can't.

185
I can't. She dumped me.

186
I mean, I totally trusted her,
and then one day it was like:

187
"Okay, bye, Pheebs. " Gone.

188
You know what the saddest part is?
When we were playing together...

189
...that was like the most fun
I've ever had in, like, all my lives.

190
My favorite shoes
So good to me, I wear them every day

191
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

192
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

193
With them, I'm one hot chickie

194
Though late one night
Not much light

195
I stepped in something icky

196
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

197
Always make me smile

198
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll

199
Avoid the

200
Pile

201
We're beginning to see a lot
of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

202
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink...

203
I'm really glad we came.

204
You're so pretty.

205
I love you.

206
Smelly cat, smelly cat

207
What are they feeding you?

208
Smelly cat, smelly cat

209
It's not your fault

210
Wow, that's great.

211
- Oh, yeah?
- You know, you could totally sell this.

212
It'd be perfect for, like, um,
a kitty-litter campaign.

213
A jingle? No, no, no.

214
Why not? You make a ton of money.

215
Okay, if I was in this for the money,
I'd be a millionaire by now, you know?

216
You gotta get out
of that jingle-head, sweetie.

217
Ugh. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.

218
- That's okay.
- Okay.

219
All right, I'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

220
Okay.
- Okay, it's called "Magician Box Mix-Up. "

221
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

222
...oversizing of accessories in general
is very popular now.

223
- Hi.
- Hey.

224
Oh, can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

225
Oh, I hate that.

226
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

227
So how was your date with Ginger?

228
Great. Ahem. It was great. She's, uh...

229
She's great. Great looking,
great personality. She's greatness.

230
Sounds like she's got the, uh...

231
...whole package.

232
- Joey told you about the leg, huh?
- Uh-huh.

233
Oh, God. It freaked me out.
Okay? I know it shouldn't have, but it did.

234
I like her. I don't wanna stop seeing her,
but every so often, it's like:

235
"Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?"

236
I mean, I'm the smallest person
in the world, aren't I?

237
I'm the smallest person in the world.

238
Morning.

239
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

240
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

241
It came up.

242
Ahem, listen, I, uh...
I know it's a long shot, but...

243
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

244
So I nodded off a little.

245
"Nodded off"? Ross, you were snoring.

246
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks.

247
Come on. Forty-five minutes.

248
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

249
Well, okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

250
...listening to Professor Pitstains
and his:

251
"Hey, everybody. Remember that thing
that's been dead for a gazillion years?

252
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had. "

253
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

254
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

255
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

256
Okay, you know what I just heard?

257
Blah, blah, blah.

258
You know what? A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what I do.

259
I wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

260
Oh, that is so...

261
No, no, no.
A bunch of out-of-control jackets...

262
...take over an island.

263
You know, if what I do is so lame...

264
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

265
Huh? Was it so
I just wouldn't go with Mark?

266
No.

267
I... I wanted to be with you.

268
I don't know. I feel like lately...

269
I feel like you're slipping away from me...

270
...with this new job
and all these new people.

271
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

272
I know it's dumb...

273
...but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

274
It's not dumb.

275
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

276
You know what I mean?

277
I mean, it's like I like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

278
That's a little clearer.

279
Honey, see, it doesn't mean
that I don't love you...

280
...because I do. I love you.
I love you so much.

281
But my work, it's for me, you know?

282
I'm out there on my own,
and I'm doing it.

283
And it's scary,
but I love it because it's mine.

284
But I mean, is that okay?

285
Sure. Ha, ha.

286
You're thinking about my leg,
aren't you?

287
No, no.

288
Actually, I forgot.
What is the deal with that again?

289
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

290
I mean, the only thing I need to know
is how much it bothers you...

291
...because I don't like wasting my time.

292
Am I wasting my time?

293
- No. No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

294
It's just like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

295
What's that?

296
That's my nubbin.

297
What's a nubbin?

298
It's kind of a, uh...
A third-nipple kind of thing.

299
Do you have three nipples?

300
Well, you know, two regulars, ahem...

301
...and, uh, one that barely qualifies.

302
- Uh, what?
- Nothing. I...

303
I just remembered. I have to leave.

304
You, uh...? You have to leave?
Now? How come?

305
Well, it's nubbin. Nothing.

306
Um, you know what?
I'll see you later. Okay.

307
Uh...

308
Ew.

309
Oh. I thought you weren't coming.

310
- Where were you?
- Come here. Come here.

311
Okay. Don't get mad, okay?

312
Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

313
I played "Smelly Cat" for the people
at my old ad agency. They went nuts.

314
No, look. I told you that I didn't want you
to try and sell it...

315
...and you just big fat did it anyway.

316
God. You know what?
I think, five years ago...

317
...I probably would have done anything
to play with you.

318
But I can do it by myself, right?
And if I can't trust you, then just forget it.

319
No. No. I don't wanna forget it.

320
Okay, you know what?
You have to choose.

321
All right? If the most important thing
on the planet to you...

322
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then, okay, you can have "Smelly Cat. "

323
But we won't be partners.

324
So what's it gonna be?

325
Smelly cat, smelly cat
Odor in the litter box?

326
Don't change your kitty.
Change your kitty litter.

327
It's not your fault

328
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Yeah.

329
You okay?

330
Yeah. I actually am. Yeah.

331
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

332
You know, you learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

333
You wanna hear a new song?

334
- Yeah.
- Oh, we'd love to.

335
Okay.

336
Jingle bitch screwed me over

337
Go to hell, jingle whore

338
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

339
That's all I have so far.

340
Well, hello.

341
Where have you been?
- The doctor.

342
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

343
Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.

344
Yep. Two nipples, no waiting.

345
Well. Just like Rachel in high school.

346
What?

347
Come on. Come on, I was kidding.
It was such an obvious joke.

348
That was an obvious joke.

349
And I didn't think of it.
Why didn't I think of it?

350
The source of all my powers.

351
Oh, dear God, what have I done?

1
Hey, how much you give me to eat
this whole jar of olives?

2
I won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me 2.95.

3
Done.

4
Hi. I need an atlas. I need an atlas.

5
Why? Do you have a report due?

6
I have a date with this diplomat I met...

7
...while I was giving free massages
outside the U.N.

8
And I don't know where his country is.

9
Okay, let's start with the free massages
at the U.N.

10
Oh, it's my new thing.
I figure, bodies at peace make peace.

11
Wow. You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

12
- So, what country is this guy from?
- Um...

13
There's a G in there.

14
- Where's that?
- In your atlas.

15
- I don't have an atlas.
- Oh.

16
- Oh, but wait, I do have a globe. Hold on.
- Oh.

17
- So, Pheebs, what's this guy like?
- Um...

18
Well, he's very...

19
...dashing, you know?

20
And, um, very, very sophisticated.
And he doesn't speak English...

21
...but according to his translator,
he totally gets me.

22
Okay, here you go.

23
What is this?

24
It's a globe.

25
And a pencil sharpener.

26
Hey, anybody need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.

27
Uh, no, thanks.

28
Okay, listen, just give me anything
I can make two of.

29
If you don't have anything to copy,
why are you going there?

30
Yeah, are you just going down there
to gawk at that hot girl...

31
...with the bellybutton ring again?

32
Yeah. You wanna come?

33
Yeah.

34
Come on, Chloe.
Finish up with your customer first.

35
Come on, Chloe. Come on, Chloe.

36
Can I help you?

37
Uh-oh.

38
Uh, you know what?

39
We're having second thoughts
about our, uh, copying needs.

40
And, uh, we'll need a little more time
to think about it.

41
Chloe, switch with me. There are
some guys here who got a crush on you.

42
Okay, that hurt us.

43
Hi, guys. I haven't seen you
since this morning.

44
Well, uh...

45
You know.

46
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

47
Both of us?

48
Maybe. Does that scare you?

49
Relax. It's just Isaac's deejaying
at The Philly.

50
- You should come.
- Oh. We'll be there.

51
Great. I'll, uh, see you then.

52
All right. Rock on.

53
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

54
Aw. Me too. Although this city is my home.

55
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.

56
Um, just... You make something up.

57
Ahem. Uh...

58
Nice. Thank you.

59
This is me. Here.

60
Your eyes are very pretty.

61
Thank you very much.

62
Oh, thank you.

63
He would like to kiss you.

64
Okay. You know what?
You don't have to do that now.

65
No, no, not him. No, you don't.

66
Okay. Well, the moment's over.

67
Oh.

68
Oy.

69
See, there it is right there.

70
Wow, it's small.

71
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks...

72
...to get all the way across it.

73
So you had fun, huh?

74
Yeah. Except for, you know,
when you're on a date...

75
...and you're getting along really great...

76
...but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

77
No.

78
- Hey.
Hey.

79
What, is, uh, Rach in her room?

80
Oh. No, she's still at work,
but she told me to tell you to call her.

81
Oh, what? Is she gonna cancel
on me again? How could she do this?

82
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

83
All right, uh, Ross, this is the extent
of my knowledge on the subject.

84
"Call Rachel. "

85
What's that on the bottom?

86
Oh. That's my doodle
of a ladybug with a top hat. Ha, ha.

87
She's fancy.

88
- Hello?
Hey, honey.

89
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. What's going on?

90
Well, there was a disaster in shipping
and I've gotta get this order in.

91
Honey, I'm so sorry,
but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.

92
What?
Well, um, how about I come up there?

93
No, no, no, honey, please.
I just have too much to deal with.

94
Anyway, I'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and, um...

95
Could you come
and be the translator's date?

96
So that when we... You know, it's time
for our alone time, you two can split off?

97
You know, he's kind of cute.

98
"Kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?

99
Or "kind of cute" like your friend
Spackle-Back Larry?

100
Hey, don't call him that.

101
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

102
Hey, you know what?
Maybe we should get going.

103
I mean, what time did Chloe say
to get there?

104
- Uh, 10:30.
- What time is it now?

105
Four-thirty.

106
- Yeah, all right. So we'll hang out.
- Yeah.

107
Hey, remember when she brought up
that thing about the three of us?

108
Yes, vividly.

109
- She was kidding about that, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

110
Yeah, I think so.

111
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight, huh?

112
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, uh...

113
...what would we do?

114
Ha, ha. Dude, I don't know. Ha-ha-ha.

115
- She was kidding.
- Yeah.

116
She was...

117
Just in case, we should come up
with a set of ground rules.

118
Yeah. For sure.

119
Okay. You probably
want the first one to be:

120
"Never open your eyes. "

121
You know? Because you don't
want to be doing something...

122
...and then look up, right?

123
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

124
Yeah. Good call. Nice.

125
Hold it. Hold it.

126
What if my eyes are closed, and...

127
And my hand is out there...

128
Aah! Okay, eyes open at all times.

129
Oh, hey.

130
How do we decide where we, ahem...

131
...you know, each would, ahem,
you know...

132
...be?
- Right. Right.

133
Well, you know, we could flip for it.

134
I guess. But, like, what's heads
and what's tails?

135
Well, if you don't know that,
then I don't want to do this with you.

136
No, no, no. I am looking
at a purchase order right here...

137
...and it clearly states
that we ordered the Riviera bikini...

138
...in a variety of sizes and colors and...

139
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

140
Could I please speak to your supervisor?
Thank you. We're holding.

141
- Hi.
- Oh!

142
My God. What are you doing here?

143
Well, you said
you couldn't go out, so...

144
You brought a picnic.
Ugh. What a boyfriend.

145
That's it. On Monday,
I start wearing makeup.

146
Ross, honey, this is very nice,
but I've got a crisis.

147
Yeah, but I've got couscous.

148
Honey. Honey, I'm sorry.
I know it's our anniversary...

149
...but I told you on the phone
I don't have time to stop.

150
Okay, you don't have to stop.
I'm invisible. I'm not here.

151
Yeah, but I don't...

152
Who approved that order?

153
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

154
- Get me Mark on the phone.
- Ugh. I love Mark. Do you know Mark?

155
- Yeah.
- Let me check that with what I've got here.

156
All right, see, 038 is not the number
for this store. Zero-three-eight is Atlanta.

157
Heh. Pepper?

158
- None for me.
- Okay, sorry. Whoo.

159
I'm sorry. As I was saying,
the store number is wrong.

160
And I'm sorry, but... Oh, my God!

161
Okay. It's fine.

162
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

163
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

164
I've got Shemp in my office.

165
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

166
But, um, hey, oh,
somebody's off the phone.

167
How about a glass of wine by the fire?
I can get it going again...

168
Ross, you're not listening.
I don't have time to stop.

169
- Come on, you don't have 10 minutes?
- I don't have 10 minutes.

170
- Sophie, does she have 10 minutes?
- Hey, Ross. I told you, I don't.

171
Don't yell at me, okay?
This is the most I've seen you all week.

172
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay?
I've got a deadline.

173
Would you just go home?
I'll talk to you later.

174
- Yeah, but wait...
- Goodbye.

175
Uh, actually, that's our three-hole punch.

176
- Hey.
- Hi.

177
Look, um, about what happened earlier...

178
Whoa. I completely understand.
You were stressed.

179
I was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

180
For what? For letting you
throw me out of your office?

181
You had no right
coming down to my office, Ross.

182
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work...

183
...unless maybe they were a park ranger.

184
Yeah, well, excuse me for wanting
to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

185
Boy, what an ass am I.

186
But I told you I didn't have the time.

187
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

188
I mean, I don't feel like
I have a girlfriend anymore.

189
Ross, what do you want from me?

190
You want me to quit my job so
you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

191
No. But it would nice if you'd realize
that it's just a job.

192
Just a job?

193
Yes.

194
Ross, do you realize this is the first time
in my life I'm doing something I care about?

195
This is the first time in my life
I'm doing something I'm actually good at?

196
I mean, if you don't get that...

197
No, hey, I get that. Okay?
I get that and I'm happy for you.

198
I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

199
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

200
Is this about Mark?

201
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

202
Oh, my God.

203
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

204
No, you're making this too hard.

205
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

206
I don't know. I don't know.

207
Look, ugh, maybe we should
just take a break.

208
Okay, okay. Fine. You're right.

209
Let's, uh... Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

210
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

211
No.

212
A break from us.

213
- And the advances in collating
in the past five years.

214
I mean, we just got in an X-5000,
you know?

215
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-71.

216
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy.

217
- Hi, Ross.
- Oh, hi, Chloe.

218
I want you to meet some friends of mine.

219
This guy's my hero.
He comes in with some stuff...

220
...he wants it blown up 400 percent.

221
We say we don't do that.
He says, "You gotta. "

222
And you know what? We did it.

223
And now any time anybody wants 400,
we just say, "Let's Ross it. "

224
And that's the only color that comes in.

225
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

226
So, what are you doing here?

227
I thought tonight was
your big anniversary dinner.

228
Yeah, a little change of plans.

229
Uh, we're gonna break up instead.

230
Oh, and I can also speak a little French.

231
Why? What did I say?

232
Well, you just asked if I wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

233
- Oh, my God.
Heh.

234
No wonder I get such great service
at Café Maurice.

235
Knock, knock, knock.

236
Hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei
that, um, I was fascinated...

237
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said in the New York Times?

238
You didn't say,
"Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "

239
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

240
He says he was too.

241
Interesting.

242
Uh, so I was wondering...

243
Before you get all talky again...

244
...um, could you also please
tell Sergei...

245
...that I really like his suit.

246
Uh, he said, "Thank you very much.
You look very pretty tonight.

247
Your hair, golden like the sun. "
So you're a chef?

248
I'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

249
- Oh, really?
- Monica...

250
...could I talk to you behind my menu,
please?

251
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was having a conversation.

252
Yeah, but Mischa's
so interested in you...

253
...that Sergei and I haven't been able
to say two words to each other.

254
What do you want me to do? Sit here
while the three of you have a conversation?

255
That would be great. Thank you.

256
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. It's Mark.

257
- Oh.
- What? Is it my breath?

258
No. Sorry. I just thought
you were somebody else. Hi.

259
Hi, well, look, I was just gonna
leave a message.

260
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

261
Well, um...

262
Rach? Are you okay?

263
Yeah, I'm fine.

264
You wanna talk? I mean, I can come over.

265
No, really, no. Please. That's okay.

266
All right. I'm coming over
and I'm bringing Chinese food.

267
- Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry.
- It's for me.

268
Oh.

269
Okay. Bye.

270
- So, what'll you do?
- What can I do?

271
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

272
Hey, no way. Come on, this is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

273
Come on. We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait a while?

274
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat.
Pick up your phone.

275
You know that whole swimming thing
is a myth.

276
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

277
Why? What happened to him?

278
Nothing. He just really believes in that.

279
Ugh. And then we got into this
big, stupid fight... It was awful.

280
I told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something, ugh...

281
And then...

282
...I told him I wanted to take a break.

283
I don't want to take a break.

284
Well, I'm sorry.

285
- Egg roll?
- No.

286
And then I called him,
and he wasn't there.

287
He's probably just out.

288
Oh, thank you. That's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.

289
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

290
- Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you called.
- Really?

291
I've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?

292
Hey, what do you want to drink?

293
Who's that?

294
Nobody?

295
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?

296
Is that Mark?

297
- Ooh, honey, look, he just came over...
- Yeah, got it.

298
Hey, Dinosaur Guy. Look at you, so sad.

299
- Come dance.
- Uh, that's okay. Thanks.

300
Hey.

301
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

302
Look, I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?

303
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.

304
And the vet said it was time.

305
And so from half-a-world away...

306
...while my mother
held the phone to his ear...

307
...I said goodbye to my dog...

308
...in seven languages.

309
- Could I have a tissue?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

310
I just hope you don't accidentally
suck it up through your nose...

311
...and choke on it.

312
Ugh. Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

313
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted. "

314
He's unbelievable. For the first time in
three years, someone wants to talk to me.

315
But do you think he would let me
enjoy that? No.

316
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English, Sergei?

317
Excuse me, but, um, ahem,
isn't he paying for your dinner?

318
Hey, the man's dog just died.

319
I have just resigned my post.

320
Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room?

321
I have diplomatic coupons.

322
It would be my pleasure.

323
My guy has coupons.

324
Your guy can't even say "coupons. "

325
Uh...

326
Uh, plate.

327
- Plate. Yes. Plate. Plate.
- Plate. Plate.

328
Plate.

329
See, we don't need them.

330
Plate?

331
Yeah.

332
Sleight of hand
And twist of fate

333
On a bed of nails
She makes me wait

334
I like this song.

335
Well, you're practically dancing already.

336
- Why don't you just do it over here?
- Oh, no.

337
- What are you, married?
- Ha, ha.

338
Because that's okay.

339
Oh, be home, be home, be home...

340
Be home, be home, be home.

341
You're not home.

342
With or without you

343
Still no smile?

344
And you give yourself away

345
And you give

346
And you give yourself away

347
American.

348
- American.
- American.

349
American. You know,
it's a very hard language.

350
Let's do it again.

1
Previously on Friends:
- I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

2
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
- Is this about Mark?
- Oh, my God.

4
- Okay, it's not.
- Oh, my God.

5
I cannot keep having
this fight with you!

6
Look, ugh,
maybe we should just take a break.

7
Fine. You're right.
Let's, uh, take a break.

8
- Let's get some frozen yogurt.
No.

9
A break from us.

10
Then we had this big fight,
and I said I wanted to take a break.

11
I don't want to take a break.

12
This is crazy.

13
Can't we work on this?

14
What do you want to drink?

15
Who's that?

16
Nobody.

17
- Is that Mark?
- Honey, look, he just...

18
Yeah. Got it!

19
Hey, come dance.
What are you, married?

20
- Ha, ha.
- Because that's okay.

21
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
How was the big anniversary dinner?

23
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

24
Ha, ha, oh. Nice.

25
We kind of broke up instead.

26
What? Aah!

27
My God! It's on the ceiling!

28
That's okay.

29
This is more important than fruit...

30
...on my ceiling.

31
You broke up?

32
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

33
- Oh, no! You and Mark?
- No, it's okay. Calm down.

34
Mark and I talked...

35
...and I realized how much
I love your stupid brother.

36
We got our problems,
but I really wanna make it work.

37
Morning!

38
Hi, it's me.

39
I've been trying to reach you all night.
I feel awful.

40
Please, Ross, you've got to know,
there's nothing between me and Mark.

41
This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.

42
Ugh, I'm sorry I put you through it.

43
And I don't want to get
back together over a machine.

44
Mm-mm.

45
So I love you.

46
I love you.

47
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...

48
...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

49
Chloe, how's it coming?

50
What kind of puppy do you think
I should get?

51
Um, oh, hey. I don't know.
How about a big one?

52
- But my apartment's so...
- Then a small one.

53
- We have to go.
- Wait! Where's my shoes?

54
You need shoes?

55
- Do I know why we're rushing?
- You know my girlfriend?

56
It turns out that she, uh,
wants to get back together.

57
I found it!

58
That's so great for you guys!

59
You must be so happy!

60
Yes, I am.
One of the many things I'm feeling.

61
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you. Ah, eh.

62
Rachel!

63
- You got my message?
- You are right on time!

64
So can I be your girlfriend again?

65
Yes, you can. Very much.

66
Ah, ah.

67
- Hey.
- Hey.

68
- Why are you mopping your ceiling?
- Ugh, there's banana on it.

69
I have the spirit of an
old Indian woman living in mine.

70
So then you know.

71
The mailman was here,
so I brought your mail.

72
- Oh, good. Thanks.
- Now, what is Fabutech?

73
Okay. Don't judge me too much, okay?

74
I saw this infomercial,
and, um, I swear I have never...

75
...bought anything on TV before.

76
Except for this mop.

77
But there was this stuff on leg-waxing,
it looked amazing.

78
- Waxine!
- Yes! Have you seen it?

79
It's incredible!
I want to be a Waxine Girl!

80
I know!

81
God! Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
How can they do that?

82
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the rain forest?

83
They have the best stuff in there.

84
Oh, my God!

85
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

86
Which is probably what
you should have done, huh? Heh.

87
You think?

88
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

89
Rachel's all "I love you,"
and all I can think about...

90
...is what is she gonna do
when I tell her what I did?

91
First, we should address
the more important question...

92
...how dumb are you?

93
What? Look, we're trying to rebuild
a relationship here, right?

94
How am I supposed to do that
without being honest?

95
I'm on board about
the total-honesty thing. I am.

96
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

97
He's right. Nobody benefits,
and you'll just hurt her.

98
And there won't be a relationship
left to rebuild.

99
Don't you think...?

100
If you have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

101
And that's what deathbeds are for.

102
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

103
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

104
Did you think about the trail?

105
What trail?

106
From the woman you did it with...

107
...to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

108
Always think about the trail!

109
I don't think there's any trail.

110
Okay, okay.

111
Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.

112
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works
at the massage place with Phoebe.

113
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,
and that's the trail! I did it!

114
"After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg... "

115
- Did that!
- Okay.

116
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...

117
...and pull it off in one quick...

118
...pain-free motion. "
- Okay.

119
Ow!

120
Was it not "pain-free"?

121
No, it was pain-ful!

122
My God, they should call it
"Pain-zine, now with a little wax. "

123
The girls on the commercial
don't seem to think it's that bad.

124
Because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

125
But, you know, if you don't
believe me, please be my guest.

126
Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my God!

127
Now are you glad we didn't start
with the bikini strips?

128
Chloe, hi.

129
Is this about me taking your watch?

130
- You took my watch?
- I'm sorry. I do that.

131
You keep it. Listen,
did you tell anyone about us?

132
Oh, no. I feel like it really
isn't anybody's business.

133
Exactly. So you didn't
mention anything to Isaac?

134
- Oh, I tell Isaac everything.
- You do? Of course you do.

135
Hi, Isaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

136
You dog!

137
Yes, I suppose I am a dog.
But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.

138
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

139
That's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

140
Oh, hey, man, I know.
It doesn't matter how much we love them.

141
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

142
Yeah. Listen, can you keep
this information to yourself?

143
Oh, no problem.
We gotta look out for each other.

144
We're the same, you and me.

145
Actually, no, we're not. Heh.

146
Yeah, we are.

147
No, we're not.

148
Yeah, we are.

149
No, we're not.

150
- Okay, we're not.
- Right.

151
But we are.

152
Fine. I just need to know
that you're not gonna tell your sister.

153
I can promise not to tell her again.

154
- Jasmine?
- Uh-huh.

155
We met at Phoebe's birthday party.
I'm Ross Geller.

156
You did a bad thing!

157
- Yes, I did.
- Very bad!

158
- Very bad.
- Very, very bad!

159
I'm agreeing with you.

160
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

161
- No.
- Okay. Jasmine.

162
Please. Please don't.

163
I love my girlfriend very much
and I want to work it out with her.

164
All right.

165
Thank you. Thank you.

166
But you should talk to my roommate.
I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

167
Who's your roommate?

168
Gunther! Gunther!

169
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place.

170
I'm sorry.

171
Was I not supposed to?

172
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

173
Ow, ow, ow!

174
We're all right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

175
- Ooh! We were just waxing our legs.
- Off?

176
For your information, this is a pain
like no man will ever experience.

177
You can't make that statement
unless you've been kicked in an area...

178
...that God only meant
to be treated nicely.

179
Women just have a lower threshold
for pain than men, that's all.

180
I mean, come on,
it's just a little wax. Heh.

181
Oh, yeah? Come here.

182
Oh, that's mature.

183
- So now I just pull it off?
- Uh-huh.

184
That's right.

185
Rachel, come on. Just talk to me. Please!

186
I can't look at you right now.
- What?

187
Nothing. Nothing.

188
- She said it was okay.
- What are they talking about?

189
- Just get away from me!
- I made a mistake, okay?

190
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

191
Whe...? Where did he put it?

192
You had sex with another woman!

193
- Oh, my God!
- Oh...

194
I knew something was wrong because
my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

195
I guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk...

196
You guys knew about this
and didn't tell us?

197
He has sex,
and we get hit in our heads!

198
- I want you to leave! Get out! Now!
- No! No!

199
I want to stay and talk about this.

200
Okay! All right. How was she?

201
Uh-oh.

202
- What?
- Was she good?

203
Don't answer that.

204
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk. How was she?

205
- She was...
- Awful.

206
- She was not good.
- Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

207
She... She was different.

208
Ooh.
Uh-oh.

209
Good different?

210
Nobody likes change.

211
- Just stop!
- What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

212
Should we do something?

213
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

214
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself...

215
...and this morning I was upset...

216
...and then I got your message,
and I was so happy.

217
And all I wanted was to get her out
of my apartment...

218
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

219
What time did your little friend leave?

220
Uh...

221
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

222
She was in there when I was in there?

223
Listen, the important thing is,
she meant nothing to me.

224
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

225
I didn't think there was
a relationship.

226
- We'd broken up.
- We were on a break.

227
That, for all I knew,
could last forever. That is a breakup.

228
You're gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

229
I'm not trying to "get out"
of anything.

230
I thought our relationship was dead.

231
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

232
I don't think we should listen
to this anymore.

233
What are you doing?
We can't go out.

234
Why not? I'm hungry.

235
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

236
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

237
Come on, I ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

238
Oh, that is so sweet.

239
I think I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

240
We can go out.
They have other things to worry about.

241
We'll be fine.

242
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.

243
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

244
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

245
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take
my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

246
...because it's 9: 15 now,
and I'm not there.

247
None of this would've happened
if I didn't think...

248
...you were having sex with Mark.

249
All right.

250
Let's say I had slept with Mark.
Would you have been able to forgive me?

251
Yes, I would.

252
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me
and been naked with me...

253
...and made love to me?

254
Yes.

255
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were...

256
La, la, la, la, la, la!

257
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I would have been devastated...

258
...but I would still want
to be with you.

259
Because, I mean, it's you.

260
Aw.

261
What?

262
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

263
I'm thinking...

264
...I'm gonna order a pizza.

265
Order a pizza, like...

266
..."I forgive you"?

267
Oh, man!

268
Pizza?

269
I like pizza.

270
Put olives on the pizza.

271
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

272
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

273
No, not the used wax.

274
Because that would be crazy?

275
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

276
Fine.

277
Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.

278
- No anchovies.
- With, uh, extra anchovies.

279
That's okay. I'll pick them off.

280
And could you chop some up
and put it right in the sauce?

281
You can have the last piece
if you want.

282
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.

283
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

284
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

285
They've got to.

286
What if they don't?

287
You think I need a new walk?

288
What?

289
Well, I've been walking
the same way since high school.

290
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

291
I think I need a take-notice walk.

292
Are you actually saying these words?

293
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

294
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

295
I thought I'd lost you.

296
How insane must I have been
to do something like this?

297
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me. I'm not Joey!

298
Whoa!

299
Yeah, okay.

300
Hey.

301
It's 3 a. m. They don't
know that I've come home yet.

302
You notice how they aren't
wondering where I am?

303
You know,
people can be so self-involved.

304
You know what? I'm not the one
that wanted that break.

305
You're the one that bailed.
You're the one...

306
...that ran the moment things
got rough.

307
- That's...
- That's what?

308
- That is neither here nor there.
- Here we are...

309
...in a spot again. What do you want?

310
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

311
Look, I...

312
I did a terrible, stupid,
stupid thing, okay?

313
I'm sorry. I wish I could
take it back, but I can't.

314
I just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

315
I love you so much.

316
No, Ross! Don't!

317
You can't just kiss me
and make it all go away.

318
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.

319
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

320
I think you should go.

321
What?

322
I really think you need to go now.

323
Okay. Okay.

324
This morning you said there was
nothing we couldn't work past it.

325
What the hell did I know?

326
There's got to be a way
we can work past this. Okay?

327
I can't imagine my life without you.

328
You know? Without...

329
Without these arms...

330
...and your face and heart...

331
...your good heart, Rach, and...

332
No.

333
I can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

334
I used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

335
Ever.

336
Now I can't stop picturing you with her.

337
I can't. It doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

338
It's just changed everything.

339
Forever.

340
This can't be it.

341
Then how come it is?

342
They've been quiet for a long time.

343
Maybe she killed him.

344
Let's go.

345
Is that your new walk?

346
No. I really have to pee.

1
Can I see the comics?

2
This is the New York Times.

3
Okay, may I see the comics?

4
I thought you were
taking Ross to the game.

5
- We are. He's meeting us here.
- No, Rachel's meeting us here.

6
Come on.
They can be in the same room.

7
- You should've been there last night.
- What happened?

8
Ross was hanging out at our place.

9
Rachel comes to borrow
moisturizer from Chandler...

10
Hey.

11
How hard is it to say "something"?

12
Rachel came over to borrow "something. "

13
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

14
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.

15
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

16
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

17
He is so unreasonable. God.

18
Although I understand what he means.

19
Oh, my God.
This is like 60 Minutes...

20
...when at first you're mad
at that pharmaceutical company...

21
...for making the drug.

22
And then, you just feel bad
for the people because...

23
...they needed
to make their hair grow.

24
You know, this is like
when my parents got divorced.

25
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me
after Cub Scouts.

26
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel
were still together.

27
And we were all
hanging out and happy.

28
I had the same dream.

29
- And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
- Oh, I had the opposite dream.

30
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

31
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

32
It never takes you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

33
Let's go. Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

34
Let me get coffee.

35
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's close.

36
Closer than here?

37
Oh, look. I found coffee.

38
Okay, let's skedaddle.

39
I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

40
Okay, Your Highness.

41
"Rachel, I'm really sorry. "
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

42
"Yeah, okay. "

43
Did anyone else hear that?

44
- Is he here?
- No.

45
Here's your moisturizer.

46
Hi.

47
You guys are gonna love me.
Okay, check it out.

48
Thursday night, five tickets.

49
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

50
I said that out loud, right?

51
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

52
...made plans with Ross.

53
Oh. Well, okay.

54
Well, there you go.

55
It's just, he got this new
home-theater dealy...

56
...and he wants us to check it out.

57
He's excited about it too.

58
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

59
- We're sorry, honey.
Oh, it's okay.

60
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

61
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

62
And heels.

63
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

64
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

65
Oh, boy, do I feel bad.

66
Very bad.

67
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- Chandler.

68
Oh, my God.

69
You're smoking again?

70
Well, actually,
yesterday I was smoking again.

71
Today I'm smoking, still.

72
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

73
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

74
...which is when
I first started smoking.

75
Weren't you 9?

76
Yeah.

77
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime...

78
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

79
Him? Ross?

80
No, "Hymn" 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow. "

81
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

82
Hi. Uh, do you guys have
weekend plans?

83
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

84
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

85
Absolutely.

86
Chandler. You're smoking?
What are you doing?

87
Shut up.
You're not my real mom.

88
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass.

89
Really? Because mine
get me out of tickets.

90
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

91
It's been a hard time right now,
so I just want to say thanks.

92
Somebody else hug him.
I have to stay by the window.

93
Oh, hey, hey.

94
How about this weekend, we have
a laser-disc marathon, okay?

95
And maybe a tournament
on my new...

96
...dart board. What do you think?

97
Two days of darts. It'll be great.

98
It'll be great for next weekend.

99
This weekend, guys.

100
It'll be great for next weekend.

101
I mean, "It'll be great. "

102
What's going on?

103
We're, um, sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

104
So, for the whole weekend?

105
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

106
That's okay. If you
all have to go away...

107
...for the first weekend I'm
alone by myself...

108
...then I totally understand.

109
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

110
The last time I went,
I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

111
I just went round and round.

112
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

113
- But you know what? I'll stay.
- No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

114
- What, a "pity stay"?
- No.

115
We're gonna have fun.

116
We can make fudge.

117
Pity food?

118
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

119
Nobody stays.

120
Well, then I might as well
offer to stay.

121
Hey...

122
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

123
You think he's still mad?

124
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

125
What? Mine aren't tinted.

126
Chandler.

127
What?

128
What does the sign say?

129
"Beam me up, Jesus. "

130
The "No Smoking" sign.

131
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

132
Well, then I have to go
to the bathroom.

133
Oh, please.

134
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

135
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go.

136
Oh, now I have to go.

137
Here we go.

138
Brace yourself.
What?

139
Okay. Ow.

140
- Aren't you gonna go?
- No, thanks.

141
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

142
They never have any paper in there.

143
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy. "

144
Well, if everybody's going...

145
Don't close it.
The keys are in there.

146
Oh, no, no, no, no.

147
- What's going on?
- My lighter's in there.

148
Damn. The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

149
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

150
Oh, I do.

151
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

152
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

153
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

154
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

155
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

156
What?

157
Come on.
Who has the biggest boobs?

158
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

159
- No.
- It's too expensive.

160
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

161
Your call.

162
Monica's are the biggest.

163
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please. It's gotta be Rachel.

164
No, mine are deceptively small.

165
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

166
Well, then your bra would
still be big.

167
No, I stuff outside the bra.

168
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

169
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

170
All right, forget it, never mind.

171
- You can have mine.
Thank you.

172
Chandler. What are you doing?
There's a trash can right there.

173
I thought if I littered, that crying
Indian might come by and save us.

174
There.

175
Thank you, Phoebe.
That's very, very generous.

176
Now, let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

177
And there you go.

178
Chandler.

179
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part.

180
Oh, no.

181
- What's going on?
- What?

182
Yeah, this has happened before.

183
- So you know how to fix it?
- Yep. Put more gas in.

184
Hi. What are you doing here?

185
I was wondering,
when you and I split up...

186
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S. H...

187
...and half the hostages coming home?

188
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico
and the hostages coming home.

189
Where's Ben?

190
- He's sleeping.
- Ah. Ooh.

191
Is this a bad time?

192
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.

193
- It's kind of an anniversary.
- Oh.

194
I thought you guys
got married in January.

195
A different kind of anniversary.

196
Oh.

197
So anyway...

198
Candles, champagne...

199
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

200
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

201
There's nothing like it
in this life. Money in the bank.

202
So Rachel and I broke up.

203
God, Ross, I am so sorry.

204
You know what?

205
I wanna talk about this so much...

206
...but when we can really get into it.

207
- You free for dinner tomorrow?
- I'd love that.

208
Me too.

209
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

210
Triple A can pick us up.

211
What town are we near?

212
Freemont. Westmont.

213
Uh, Westberg?

214
Why are you answering?

215
Do you know
what route we're on?

216
We are definitely on Route 27.

217
We are at a rest stop on Route 27...

218
There is no Route 27.

219
- Either 93 or 76.
I don't know.

220
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

221
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

222
And also 93?

223
Okay.

224
No, they don't do that.

225
Somebody will come and save us.

226
Who? Have you seen a car
in the last hour and a half?

227
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.

228
I am not getting in a car with Ross.

229
We will just have to...

230
...live here.

231
- But it's so cold.
- No.

232
I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.

233
Joey and Chandler are back.

234
- So the going-for-help went well?
- Oh, yeah.

235
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

236
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

237
Then why are you smoking?

238
It's very unsettling.

239
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

240
They just took off
without even looking back.

241
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.

242
You and Susan.

243
Susan will be so pleased.

244
Seven-one-seven?

245
Where's 717?

246
You have more of these
for Susan, right?

247
No, but that's okay.

248
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

249
- Ross, thank God.
Pheebs?

250
Why are you whispering?

251
I ate a bug.

252
Hey, Rach. The tampons here
are only a penny.

253
Let's stock up.

254
We're out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

255
- Oh. Now you want a favor?
- Yes, please.

256
I'm sorry your
car broke down, Pheebs...

257
...but I'm too busy with some of
my real friends right now.

258
But please call to let me know
you got home safely.

259
Phoebe, hang on a second.

260
Take my car.
Get your friends.

261
No, I won't pick them up.

262
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

263
So you can sulk here for half an hour,
then go get them...

264
...or save time and sulk in the car.
- Rachel doesn't...

265
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

266
...and you're the innocent victim
in this.

267
But don't punish your friends
for what Rachel did.

268
Yeah, you're right.

269
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.

270
What? You slept with someone else?

271
We were on a break.

272
We were... Yeah.

273
Where are you? I'll find you.

274
You slept with another woman?

275
Oh, you're one to talk.

276
Okay, done.

277
What's "pleh"?

278
That's "help" spelled backwards...

279
...so that the helicopters can read it
from the air.

280
Ha. What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

281
Car. Car.

282
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives.

283
Hey.

284
What is he doing here?

285
He is saving your butt.

286
Unless I'm stepping on
some toes here...

287
...in which case,
I could just mosey on.

288
I have plenty of people to help
on the interstate.

289
Come on.
We need your help, please.

290
Fine. Fine.

291
Oh, no. Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

292
You guys...

293
...what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

294
Just send him back,
then we'll go skiing?

295
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

296
Should we ask Ross to come along?

297
But what about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

298
Ask me what?

299
If, uh, it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

300
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

301
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come.

302
- Excuse me?
It's horrible.

303
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

304
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

305
Oh. Hitting me where it hurts.
My ski skills.

306
Here we go again.

307
I can't handle this, you guys.

308
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

309
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

310
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

311
Let's go.

312
You're welcome.

313
I'm sorry. Were you speaking
to me, or sleeping with someone else?

314
We were on a break.

315
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

316
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

317
Monica agrees with me.

318
What?

319
I don't know.

320
You said it last night.

321
What I said
was that I understood.

322
Joey is the one who agreed with you.

323
Really, Joey?

324
What?

325
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

326
I think it's very obvious
who's wrong here.

327
Obviously not to Joey.

328
What?

329
Joey and Monica feel like I do.
You and this innocent act.

330
Hey, guess who I am?

331
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

332
Look what you're doing to Chandler.

333
Look. We know that this is
really, really hard for you guys.

334
You don't have to love each other.

335
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

336
But please find a way
to be around each other.

337
And not put us in the middle.

338
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

339
Is that what you want?

340
Can you be civil?

341
- Yeah.
- I can.

342
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing...

343
...and my chest is unsupported.

344
Wait a second.

345
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?

346
Look, you guys should go.

347
You know,
you planned this all out...

348
...and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.

349
- You drove all the way up here.
- No, no, no.

350
I've gotta take
the car back anyway.

351
I'm spending all day
tomorrow with Ben.

352
It's fine, okay? Just go.
No guilt, I promise.

353
Thank you.

354
We'll call you when we get back.

355
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

356
Or the rodeo.

357
- That would be great.
- Okay.

358
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

359
I know.

360
Bye.

361
- Ross.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

362
- Were you sleeping?
- Uh, no.

363
Oh, great.

364
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

365
You don't want to skimp there.

366
You're a genius.

367
It came to about $112.

368
But what the hell,
call it an even 110?

369
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye.

370
So they, uh, all took off.

371
It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

372
Yeah, okay. Bye.

373
So I'm gonna take off then.

1
What's so funny?

2
Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
Oh.

4
What? What's so funny?

5
Oh, no, no.

6
No, no. There's none of that in here.

7
Oh, come on.
At least let me finish this last one.

8
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.

9
Okay.

10
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

11
Why don't you hold on to that one.

12
That's, like, the least fun game ever.

13
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

14
...that is going to help you quit.

15
Oh.

16
That patch is no good.

17
It's a hypnosis tape.

18
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

19
Ha!

20
What's your problem?

21
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

22
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

23
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

24
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

25
Forget hypnosis.

26
The way to quit smoking is
to dance naked in a field of heather...

27
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy young men.

28
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night. "

29
- Here you go.
- I didn't want cinnamon on this.

30
Sorry.

31
- Hi. Hi.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

32
Ha, ha. Hi. How are you?

33
What are you doing here?

34
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

35
And then, uh, my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

36
And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

37
What happened?

38
Uh, oh. Vandalism.

39
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

40
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

41
- You're getting married?
- Oh, yeah.

42
Aah!

43
My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.

44
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?

45
Do I?

46
Do you?

47
Yeah, I do.

48
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

49
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get
my, uh, fiancée, man!

50
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

51
Isn't it fantastic?

52
Yeah, but don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

53
- What? He's 18.
- It'll be illegal for him to drink...

54
...at his own bachelor party.

55
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

56
Always illegal, Joe.

57
Hey! Hey!

58
This is, uh, my fiancée...

59
...Mrs. Knight.
- Ha-ha-ha.

60
- That's my sister.
- You know, it's funny.

61
Frank told me so much about you,
but you're not how I pictured you at all.

62
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

63
- Here you go. Here, grab a seat.
- Oh.

64
So how did you guys meet?

65
Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's...

66
I mean, Alice. Sorry.
I always do that. Ha, ha.

67
I was in her Home Ec class.

68
He was my best student.

69
She was my best teacher.

70
Aww.

71
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

72
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

73
Yeah. Ha, ha.

74
We talked about just living together,
but, um...

75
...we wanna have kids right away.

76
Oh, my God!

77
Great!

78
Wow, kids. Frank,
are you sure you're ready for that?

79
How hard can it be?

80
You know, I mean, you know, babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

81
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

82
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

83
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

84
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

85
But when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

86
You are falling fast asleep.

87
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

88
You are now completely asleep.

89
You don't need to smoke.

90
Cigarettes don't control you.

91
You are a strong, confident woman...

92
...who does not need to smoke.

93
A strong, confident woman.

94
You know what? I realized in the last year
I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.

95
You gotta help me out. Set me up.
Get me back in the game.

96
Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion,
and all I meet are eligible straight men.

97
Can I get you something else?

98
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

99
Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?

100
- You just said to her...
- You wanna go out with me...

101
...because of my wig, the big boobs,
and I serve you food.

102
If that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

103
And the two times we went out,
it was plain awkward.

104
You think she should go out with me,
don't you?

105
Ha, ha.

106
Well, I mean...

107
...are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

108
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning, know what I mean?

109
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

110
Really. Think about it.

111
Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.

112
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.

113
You know?

114
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

115
What, is it the age thing?

116
No, I'm fine with the age thing...

117
...until it sticks its tongue
down my brother's throat.

118
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

119
You think he'll enjoy it
when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

120
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

121
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

122
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

123
Have you told him how you feel?

124
Yes. Not out loud.

125
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

126
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

127
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

128
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

129
No, no, no, no, no, no.

130
Come on, you guys.

131
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

132
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

133
No.

134
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

135
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

136
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes. " Remember?

137
And then, heh, you say,
"Let's just hang out at your place. "

138
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

139
I think you should
go out with this guy.

140
No, he doesn't do anything for me.

141
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

142
Well, um, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids. Heh.

143
All right, I get your point.

144
- Hey.
Hey.

145
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

146
I just carry it around.

147
- You got any Chap Stick?
- Uh, yeah.

148
Hey, how are those tapes working out?

149
Pretty good. Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.

150
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

151
Thank you.

152
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

153
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

154
That check thing was adorable.

155
What check thing?

156
As a joke, this customer who has a
crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

157
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

158
Pete Becker. Pete...

159
Is this him?

160
That's Bill Clinton.

161
Who's he hugging?

162
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

163
This guy invented Moss 865.

164
Every office in the world
uses that program.

165
- We use it!
- There you go!

166
Oh, my God. Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

167
- No, I'm not gonna go out with him.
- Oh, my God.

168
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.

169
Or incredibly offensive.

170
Yeah, sure. That too.

171
What?

172
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

173
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

174
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

175
You don't think I know that?

176
Look, the point is...

177
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

178
Yeah, he's right. He's right.
This is your time, you know?

179
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

180
But isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

181
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

182
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

183
You don't have it anymore?

184
No, I, uh... I slept with someone else.

185
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

186
It didn't.

187
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

188
Now what is that like?

189
It's so cool, man.

190
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

191
Yeah. Yeah.

192
- Why can't I find that?
- I had it and I blew it.

193
- Well, I want it!
- You can have it.

194
Maybe I can't.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

195
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

196
- Then you hold on to it!
- All right, man!

197
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

198
You're Frank's best man?

199
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

200
What about you, huh?

201
I'm the ring bearer.

202
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi. Thanks.

203
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real, um, Home Ec emergency.

204
- Oh, my God. Who died on this?
- Yeah, I know.

205
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe. "

206
- Can you help me?
- Absolutely.

207
Okay, first, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

208
- Then if that doesn't work...
- You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.

209
Oh, no, never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

210
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

211
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother, Frank?

212
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

213
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

214
- Got it, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

215
You have Monica Geller here.

216
Uh, absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

217
Hi.

218
What the hell is this?

219
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

220
You got it.

221
- I'm sorry. What?
- What's this supposed to mean?

222
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

223
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

224
I mean, what's the deal?
Are you trying to buy me?

225
Is this the way you get girls
to go out with you?

226
Uh, I'm still here.

227
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

228
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

229
...and there wouldn't be this,
uh, heat between us.

230
- What?
- Come on.

231
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

232
You were the chef,
and I was the customer.

233
But now we're this couple that fights.

234
Okay, um...

235
...you're a loon.

236
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

237
I think you're great.

238
Come on, what do you say?

239
I don't know.

240
Why not?

241
I don't wanna encourage this behavior.

242
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

243
We go out, we eat.

244
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

245
Hi.
- Aah! No!

246
Wait, no. Just put the mail down.
It's me.

247
Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?

248
Well, um, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

249
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, sure.

250
So how was your day?

251
It's just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

252
What, um...? What happened?

253
Um, Alice, uh...

254
She, uh, called it off.

255
Oh, no.

256
Did, um... Did she say why?

257
Uh, no, not really.
Just that I was too young.

258
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

259
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

260
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't...

261
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

262
Well, yeah, if the best is
like unbelievable pain.

263
Oh, sweetie.

264
You know, I was just finally happy.

265
For the first time in my life...

266
...after my dad left me...

267
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

268
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

269
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

270
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

271
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

272
Ugh. Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

273
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

274
- What?
- Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...

275
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

276
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

277
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

278
Okay...

279
Wait, no. My mother didn't want us
to be together...

280
...but the worst thing she did
was tie me to the porch.

281
Okay, but...

282
I came to you because
I thought you'd understand.

283
Oh, no!

284
No... Ugh.

285
I would storm out of here...

286
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

287
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

288
Oh, my God!

289
Guys, please.
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

290
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

291
I know.

292
Okay, then get the lobster.

293
Hey.
- Hi.

294
- Hi.
- Hey.

295
Hello.

296
Hey, how much cash you got
in your pocket right now?

297
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

298
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

299
- Where do you wanna go?
- You like pizza?

300
- Oh, that sounds great.
- I know a great little place.

301
You're not paying for the pizza.

302
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

303
Is that enough lira?

304
Uh, I'd throw another 1000 on that.

305
- How much is that?
- That's about 60 cents.

306
Every night!

307
You don't need to smoke.

308
Cigarettes don't control you.

309
You are a strong, confident woman...

310
...who does not need to smoke.

311
A strong, confident woman...

312
...who does not need to smoke.

313
So can I.

314
Hey, Frank.

315
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

316
But I so didn't.

317
Someone's here who can explain this
better than I can.

318
We can go look.

319
Hi, Frank.

320
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

321
Phoebe's right, Frank.

322
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

323
I was being selfish.

324
Even though we want
the same things right now...

325
...in the future, we may not.

326
- Is that what it is?
- Yes, but not just that.

327
Right, not just that.

328
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

329
...nonetheless...

330
- Nonetheless.
- Nonetheless.

331
Um...

332
You're too young...

333
...to really know what you want.

334
That's right, exactly.

335
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

336
Bye-bye.

337
The important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

338
This is clearly wrong.

339
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

340
Okay, can I just get my purse?

341
Mmm.
- Okay, all right, good.

342
Cigarettes don't control you.

343
You are a strong, confident woman...

344
...who does not need to smoke.

345
Joey's your best friend.

346
You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.

347
And you also wanna buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.

1
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2
"Say, Rachel...

3
...I was wondering if you'd like to go
to a movie with me sometime...

4
...as my lover. "

5
Mm. Too out there.

6
"Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...

7
...as my lover. "

8
- Hi.
- Hi.

9
All right, let's go shopping.

10
You know, before we go, uh,
there's something I need to say.

11
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

12
I've kind of had this, uh...
This crush on you.

13
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

14
Now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

15
So that's what I'm doing now.

16
Wow. Um...

17
I dropped a cup.

18
So that's why within a few years,
that voice recognition...

19
...is gonna be pretty much standard
on any computer.

20
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car. Clean my room. "

21
It's not gonna be able to do
any of those things...

22
...but it'll understand
what you're saying.

23
- Oh, this was so great.
- Yeah, it was.

24
All right, then.

25
Bye.

26
Hello, people who do not live here.

27
Hi.
- Hello.

28
I gave you a key for emergencies.

29
We were out of Doritos.

30
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

31
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

32
Third wife sold separately. "

33
He's great. I mean,
we have such a good time together.

34
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all.

35
- Still?
No.

36
It's driving me crazy. I mean, in every
other way, he's like the perfect guy.

37
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

38
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper Image?

39
Two.

40
Wow. Can Joey and I
put them on and fight?

41
Oh, Mommy. Oh, Daddy.
I am a big old baddy.

42
I guess he must've gotten the part
in that play.

43
- Oh.
- Either that or Gloria Estefan was right.

44
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

45
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.

46
- Hey.
- Hi.

47
Ah, so you're playing Adrianne, huh?

48
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

49
No, no. Uh, I'm playing your husband,
Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

50
Hi. Nice to meet you. Kate Miller.

51
Heh. So the, uh, play's pretty great, huh?

52
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

53
She's so brilliantly incisive...

54
...when it comes to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

55
Oh, forget about it. She rocks. Ha, ha.

56
Where do I know you from?

57
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

58
Days of our Lives?

59
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

60
No, that's not it.

61
So you're a soap actor.

62
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play. Hmm?

63
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

64
That infomercial.

65
For the milk-carton-spout thing.

66
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk.

67
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.

68
Ha, ha. Now, see, that's acting.

69
Right. At the end, you choked
on a cookie.

70
Yeah, that was real.

71
- Wow. I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.

72
Well, So, what are you gonna tell him?

73
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

74
Huh.

75
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

76
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...

77
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

78
...which I'm allowed to do...

79
...and I felt guilty, you know,
like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

80
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

81
...that you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

82
- I don't have any issues with my father.
- Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.

83
I hate this woman. I hate her.

84
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

85
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks.

86
Okay? And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me.

87
- Hello.
Hey.

88
So Rachel called.

89
Wants to see me.

90
Going over in a minute.

91
- Wow. What do you think she wants?
- Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

92
...and she realizes that life without me...

93
...sucks.

94
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

95
Just trying to be supportive.

96
Well, be supportive like a guy.

97
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

98
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
You, uh, wanted to see me?

100
Yeah.

101
Uh, here's a box of your stuff.

102
- What?
- Uh, it's just like hats and a shirt and CD's.

103
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

104
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

105
No.

106
Ross.

107
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

108
I mean, don't you think?

109
- Yes.
- Yeah.

110
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

111
Yeah, I really do.

112
Hey...

113
This was a gift.

114
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

115
It's still a gift.

116
I got it from the gift shop.

117
Okay. All right. Give me the mug.
I'll keep the mug.

118
No. You know, don't do me any favors.
In fact, where...

119
Where's the rest of my stuff? Huh?
Like my, um...

120
Hey. This book is mine.

121
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

122
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

123
I'm just trying to help you move on.

124
Oh, you are a petty man.

125
You are a petty, petty...

126
- Petty...
... petty, petty...

127
...small...
... small...

128
You are so just doing this
out of spite.

129
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

130
I'm gonna wear this all the time.
I love this shirt.

131
You haven't worn that since you were 15.
It doesn't even fit you anymore.

132
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

133
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

134
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

135
...and relax...

136
...in my favorite shirt.

137
You have a pleasant evening.

138
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

139
And you're our age. You're our age.

140
You know what?
You should, like, buy a state...

141
...and then just name it after yourself.

142
What, like, "Pete Dakota"?

143
Or "Mississi-Pete. "

144
Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

145
That's not a state, Joe.

146
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

147
I gotta go, so, uh,
I'll see you guys later.

148
- Okay. You're our age.
- Okay.

149
So, uh, are we on for tomorrow?

150
Absolutely.

151
Now get out of here, you.

152
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

153
Is there something wrong with me?

154
I mean, why am I only attracted to guys
where there's no future?

155
Either they're too old
or they're too young.

156
And there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

157
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on.

158
Seriously. Does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

159
Yeah, kind of.

160
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

161
Happy?

162
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be? Huh?

163
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

164
I talk to you, and nothing.

165
You look at me, and it's nothing.

166
Nothing.

167
Tasty.

168
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

169
- I have a question about this scene.
Yes.

170
Well, I don't understand
why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

171
Peel the onion.

172
First of all, he's good-looking.

173
Yeah.

174
I think my character is gonna need
a bit more of a reason than that.

175
Oh, hey, how about this one?
Uh, it says so in the script.

176
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

177
I mean, it says in the script here
that you're a bitch.

178
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.

179
I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it.
It doesn't matter.

180
I still wind up with this
little cowlick-y thing...

181
...on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.

182
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.

183
Is there any chance you didn't see that?

184
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

185
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

186
You're gonna get peep-eye.

187
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

188
She'd say no, but here we are, right?

189
We just broke up,
first thing she does.

190
You didn't just break up.

191
Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.

192
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

193
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

194
Here they come. Here they... Oh.

195
If she kisses him good night,
I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

196
I can't watch.

197
Come on. Date over. Date over.

198
- Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.

199
She's going in. Ha, ha.
Wait. He's going in.

200
He's going in.

201
The door's closed. I can't see
anything with the door closed.

202
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

203
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it.

204
- Stop what?
- I don't know.

205
But I have a feeling
that my being there will do it.

206
I'll go over and I will borrow something.

207
- Juice. I need juice.
- No.

208
- You can't.
- A little help.

209
- They must be stopped.
- I am your friend...

210
...and I am not gonna let you do this.

211
You are surprisingly strong.

212
- I need juice. People need juice.
- Look, man...

213
- People need juice. Juice. They need...
- Listen to me.

214
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

215
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole...

216
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact that the relationship is over.

217
Okay, man? It's over.

218
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

219
It's just I miss her so much.

220
I know.

221
Why do all your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

222
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

223
That way, if one of them is missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

224
You know what?

225
No, and I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

226
I can't do this.

227
Yep. Yep.
That's what I didn't want to know.

228
Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

229
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

230
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

231
Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?

232
Look, you wanna get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

233
Really.

234
No, no. I say we get back at him right here
on this couch. Right here.

235
Oh, my God.

236
I'm sorry about this.

237
That's okay.

238
- You sure?
- Yeah.

239
I can just go home
and get back at him by myself.

240
And should become
the penicillin of the 21 st century.

241
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

242
...toward leading that revolution.

243
- It is truly ironic.
- Hey. Can I ask you something?

244
Where are we?

245
Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

246
...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.

247
Just tell me the truth.

248
Okay.

249
Um, you know, I don't think
I told you this...

250
...but, um, I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

251
Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?

252
So I did tell you.

253
Okay, well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

254
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...

255
...where I just need to focus on me.
- Mm.

256
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I know.

257
- I so want to be attracted to you.
- But you're not. Okay. Good.

258
I'm sorry.

259
You know what? Don't be.
This is not...

260
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

261
- It's not?
- Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

262
Or someone you find attractive.

263
I just think, you know...

264
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

265
Well, look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...

266
...but, uh, you seem awfully confident
for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.

267
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

268
Uh, listen. Let's...
You wanna get something to eat?

269
Because this place is kind of depressing.

270
Now the man who made
this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

271
One second.

272
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

273
Draw.

274
I wasn't doing anything.

275
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

276
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...

277
...since sliced bread.

278
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

279
God, I just... I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...

280
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good. "

281
I think somebody has a crush
on somebody.

282
Hey, Chandler, can we please try
and stay focused on my problem here?

283
You know?

284
I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.

285
Oh.

286
Oh. You're out of your mind.

287
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

288
If you were in school yard...

289
...you'd be pulling her pigtails
and pushing her down now.

290
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I keep thinking about her...

291
...in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff, huh?

292
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

293
Well, why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

294
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

295
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

296
You look at me, and nothing.

297
Nothing.

298
You guys make me fly.

299
High.

300
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here
tomorrow.

301
- Well, that was, uh...
- Better?

302
Yeah, yeah, it was definitely...

303
...an improvement.

304
- Good night.
Uh, Kate.

305
Yeah?

306
You, uh... You forgot your shoes.

307
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

308
- Okay.
- Hey, listen...

309
...you, uh, feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

310
- Um... Yo.
- Kate.

311
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

312
Very nice. Very nice.

313
So, um...

314
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

315
- Right.
- Good night.

316
Hey.

317
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

318
You know, like Goldman, Silverman?

319
Because it's not his last name.

320
- It isn't?
- No, it's not, like...

321
Like Phil Spiderman.

322
He's a spider...

323
...man.

324
You know, like, uh...
Like Goldman is a last name.

325
But there's no gold man.

326
Oh, okay.

327
There should be a Gold Man.

328
- Hey.
Hey, Rach.

329
- How was work?
- Oh, great.

330
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

331
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

332
Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

333
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...

334
Something wrong?

335
Hmm. No. Nothing.

336
So, uh, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

337
Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

338
- What about things that are already gold?
- Ah. His work is done.

339
Okay, let's play my game.

340
Okay.

341
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered...

342
Draw.

343
Yeah, it's fun.

1
All right, they got water,
orange juice...

2
...and what looks like cider.

3
Taste it.

4
Yeah, it's fat.

5
I drank fat!

6
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

7
Hey.

8
Hey, Mr. Tux.

9
- Why aren't you dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

10
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 20 to 8.

11
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us
two minutes to get dressed.

12
I'd feel better if you
got dressed now.

13
- Okay.
- Okay.

14
Hey!

15
Oh, look at you, all sexy.

16
Really?

17
Wow!

18
- Hi.
- Hi.

19
- How come you didn't come over earlier?
- Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.

20
Hey, Ross, want some cider?

21
No.

22
So you're pretty close, huh?

23
Makeup's on. Hair's done.

24
I just have to get dressed.

25
And that takes, what?
Just 6 or 7 minutes?

26
Yeah. Once I figure out
what I'm wearing.

27
Glass of fat?

28
The One Where No One's Ready

29
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?

30
Nope.

31
- You wanna hear it?
- Am I in it?

32
Uh-huh.

33
After I thank everyone
for donating to the museum...

34
...I sing a song about the wonder
that is Joey.

35
- Hello.
Hey.

36
Whoa!

37
Hello! You look great!

38
Thank you. I know, though.

39
You see this? This is a person
who is ready to go.

40
Phoebe, you...

41
You are my star.

42
Aw. Well, you're my lucky penny.

43
All right, I took the quiz, and it
turns out I do put career before men.

44
Get up.

45
What?

46
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

47
I was sitting there.

48
But then you left.

49
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

50
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.

51
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!

52
The "big deal" is, I was sitting
there last! So...

53
...it's my seat.

54
Well, actually, the last place
you were sitting was in there, so...

55
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

56
You both have to go get dressed before
the big vein in my head pops.

57
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.

58
Get up!

59
- Hi.
Hey.

60
Ooh. Phoebe, you look great!

61
All right already.

62
Ooh. Are you gonna do magic?

63
That's funny. Change.

64
- Hang on, I just got in.
- I don't care.

65
It starts at 8.
We can't be late.

66
"He could not, would not,
want to wait. "

67
Our table is down in front.
My boss will be there.

68
Everyone will see if we arrive
after it starts.

69
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

70
Does this look like something a
paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

71
I don't know.
You might be the first one.

72
- Rach, did you check the machine?
No.

73
Wait. This is the outfit that makes
my calves look fat. Never mind.

74
Well, Joey, I wrote
a little song today.

75
It's called, "Get up!"

76
All right. You can have the chair.

77
- Really?
- Oh, my. Would you look at that?

78
I'm coming over.

79
What if I'm already there
when you play this message?

80
Is that too spooky?

81
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me. Pick up.

82
Rachel? Rach?

83
What?

84
Never mind.

85
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

86
Is that message old or new?

87
Old or new? Old or new?

88
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?

89
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.

90
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?

91
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.

92
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

93
When Carol and I broke up...

94
...I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?

95
I got dressed.

96
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

97
There we go. There we go.

98
You know what? Don't get up.
Just sit there.

99
I just hope you don't mind
my hand right here.

100
Not touching. Can't get mad!
Not touching. Can't get mad!

101
Not touching. Can't get mad!

102
Oh! Oh, my God!

103
You rotten boys!

104
- Sorry, Phoebe.
- What am I gonna do?

105
Don't rub it!
What gets out hummus?

106
What gets out hummus?

107
Monica!
What gets out hummus?

108
If it is a new message,
what is he calling to say?

109
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

110
Maybe he called to say
you're obsessive and crazy?

111
- So should I call him back?
- No!

112
No!

113
- Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
- Fine with me.

114
I am so comfortable.

115
Me too.

116
In fact, I think I might be
a little too comfortable.

117
Okay, we have 19 minutes.
I want you to go and change.

118
When you come back, Joey will go change,
and he'll have vacated the chair.

119
- Okay.
- All right.

120
Fine. I'm going.

121
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I'm the guy...

122
...who's sitting in a chair!

123
Is this a little too...?

124
Pheebs? What happened?

125
I got the hummus.

126
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?

127
- It won't go with this dress.
- You're right.

128
- Well, let's just get you out of that.
- No, no, no. Not out of that.

129
- Not out of clothes.
- Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

130
I called him.

131
Yes. I got his machine
and I left a message.

132
But it's okay. It's okay...

133
...because it was, like,
a casual, breezy message.

134
It was breezy.

135
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

136
How could it not be breezy? No,
because you're in such a breezy place.

137
I got it. I'll play my message, and
you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

138
But how you gonna do that?

139
I know the code
to his answering machine.

140
Okay, Mon, I really don't think
this is the...

141
Okay, you're dialing.
You are dialing.

142
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.

143
You have two new messages.

144
What a cool job.

145
"You have two new messages. "

146
Please pass the pie.

147
Hi, it's Monica.
I'm just checking in.

148
I got a message and didn't know
if it was old or new...

149
...so I'm just checking.

150
So let me know.

151
Or don't. Whatever.

152
I'm breezy!

153
You can't say you're "breezy. "
That negates the "breezy. "

154
Hola. It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.

155
Call me about this weekend, okay?

156
Now, she sounded breezy.

157
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.

158
- You don't know that.
- Well, whose voice was that?

159
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.

160
Michelle. Of course!
Did it sound like Michelle?

161
Oh, great. It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.

162
It was Michelle.

163
It was definitely Michelle.

164
Try Monica's green dress. If it
doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

165
- Unless I wear it.
- You don't know what you're wearing?

166
I'm just trying to look nice
for your big night.

167
Yeah, which we have to leave for
in 12 minutes.

168
Come on, I'll just pick
something out for you.

169
You'll notice that I'm fully dressed.

170
I, in turn, have noticed
that you are not.

171
So in the words of A.A. Milne,
"Get out of my chair, dill-hole. "

172
Okay.

173
- What are you doing?
- You said to give you the chair.

174
You didn't say anything about cushions.

175
They're the essence
of the chair!

176
That's right! I'm taking the essence.

177
Oh, he'll be back.

178
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

179
- I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
- That was a Halloween costume.

180
Unless you would like me to go
as Little Bo Peep.

181
I didn't recognize it
without that inflatable sheep.

182
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,
I would like back one of these days.

183
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this
perfect for me?

184
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

185
Of course not for tonight.
Hi. I'm going to a benefit.

186
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?

187
No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it.
I love you. Breathe.

188
We used them as pillows
when we went camping.

189
What?

190
The sheep.

191
Hey, what you do on your own time...

192
- Where's my underwear?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

193
- Come on, you took his underwear?
- He took my essence!

194
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear
the underwear you're wearing now?

195
Because I'm not wearing
any underwear now.

196
Then why do you have
to wear underwear tonight?

197
It's a rented tux, okay?

198
I'm not gonna go "commando"
in another man's fatigues.

199
Then somebody's gonna have
to give somebody back his cushions.

200
Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna
do the exact opposite to you.

201
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

202
Hey, opposite...

203
...is opposite.

204
He's got nothing!

205
Okay, I'm ready.

206
Rachel didn't have anything I liked
but this ribbon.

207
I thought, all right,
I'll be political.

208
- What are you supporting?
- Christmas.

209
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,
and I have exactly 12 minutes...

210
What?

211
My watch stopped.
My watch. Okay, see...

212
...the dinosaur tail
isn't going around anymore.

213
What time is it? It's 7:33.
I have 7 minutes.

214
I have seven minutes!

215
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?

216
- Just pick one, okay?
- Oh, okay, okay. The black.

217
Do you have black
with little strappies?

218
Yeah, but those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.

219
Yeah, pants! What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.

220
I don't know what you're doing
but just get in there...

221
...and pick out any shoes
that fit your feet.

222
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make...

223
...your ankles or your knees or your
earlobes look fat. Just do it!

224
Go in there, pick something out
so we can go.

225
- All right.
- Thank you.

226
I've got to call Michelle to see
if that was her voice.

227
It was. It was her voice.

228
Monica, I think you've gone over
to the bad place.

229
Hola.

230
Hello? Hello?

231
- Okay. That was her, right?
- Definitely. Yeah.

232
So there you go. Whew!

233
We're out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.

234
- I'll get it.
Okay.

235
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

236
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?

237
Ooh! It's Michelle! Ooh!

238
She must have that "caller I.D." thing.
You should get that.

239
Michelle?

240
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.

241
Just try to be...

242
You're so sweet.

243
Yeah, we were a great couple.

244
I know, I really miss him.

245
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that...

246
You know what's weird?

247
Donald Duck never wore pants.

248
But when he gets
out of the shower...

249
...he always puts a towel
around his waist.

250
I mean, what is that about?

251
I only beeped in so I could
hear my own message.

252
I mean, that's allowed.

253
Yeah!

254
I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn't tell your dad about...

255
What do you mean, you don't feel
comfortable with this? We're friends!

256
That bitch always hated me.

257
- I'm calling her back.
- No, no, no! Tick, tick, tick.

258
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

259
- She's got a phone in there, right?
- Okay, we're on it.

260
Um, heh, heh...

261
I know it says, "black tie optional"...

262
...but this may be pushing it a little.

263
I'm not gonna go.

264
You're not gonna go?

265
No, I think I'm gonna catch up
on my correspondence.

266
How can you not be going?

267
I'm not gonna go.

268
So I think that will accomplish
the "not going. "

269
Um, you know, just out of curiosity...

270
Ever since I was humiliated
and yelled at in front of my friends...

271
...I'm just, I don't know, not in a
very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

272
Right. Well, okay. Okay.
God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.

273
- That's fine.
- No, but you're mad.

274
I'm not mad. I'm just not going.

275
- Right.
- Okay.

276
- You know that I have to go, right?
- Mm-hm.

277
So is it gonna be like
I'm abandoning you while you're upset?

278
- No.
- No?

279
- You're not upset about the yelling.
- Right. And the humiliating.

280
Well, of course, the humiliating.

281
So we...

282
...we're okay?

283
- We're good.
- Right.

284
- Honey? I love you.
- Yes, Ross.

285
Get away from that phone!

286
She's just getting dressed now.

287
Is it wrong that I was
totally aroused by that?

288
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

289
You hide my clothes.
I'm wearing everything you own.

290
Oh, my God!

291
That is so not the opposite
of taking somebody's underwear!

292
Look at me! I'm Chandler.

293
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

294
Maybe if I wasn't going commando...

295
It's hot with all this stuff on.

296
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

297
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.

298
I'm sick of this.
I've had it up to here.

299
Neither of you can come to the party!

300
Jeez, what a baby!

301
Way to ruin it.
I was just gonna go get dressed.

302
The only person
I cared about getting dressed...

303
...is the person who's
not even gonna go.

304
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?

305
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.

306
I need you there.

307
What can I do to show you
how much I want you to be there?

308
You could drink the fat.

309
Welcome to an adult conversation.

310
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
- That actually sounds interesting.
- What?

312
I think you should drink the fat.

313
Yay!

314
Okay, if that's what it takes to
show you how much you mean to me...

315
...and how much I want you there,
that's what I'll do.

316
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.

317
I think this will be fine.

318
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake...

319
...with chicken bits floating in it.

320
Cheers.

321
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.

322
You will?

323
You were really gonna do that?

324
Well, yeah.

325
You were gonna drink the fat.

326
Let's see what else he'll do!

327
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.

328
I'll get a cab. I want everyone
downstairs in two minutes.

329
Monica!

330
Stop it.

331
Stop it!

332
Ross went to get a cab so we...

333
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

334
Hi, this is Richard.

335
You have three new messages.

336
Not anymore.

337
Message erased.

338
To record your message,
begin speaking at the tone.

339
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

340
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

341
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

342
Anyway, I beeped into your machine
and I heard this message...

343
...that freaked me out...

344
...and Michelle will tell you the rest.

345
I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we
can just forget the whole thing.

346
Your outgoing
message has now been changed.

347
Outgoing?

348
Did that say outgoing?

349
Not outgoing!

350
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

351
Listen, I did something
kind of crazy tonight.

352
Maybe I'm getting my period
or something. I don't know.

353
- How did you do that?
- I don't know!

354
Goodbye.
- No!

355
Okay.

356
Okay, I've got two cabs
and no people! Go, go, go!

357
Maybe we can call the phone company
to change the message?

358
They could change his number.

359
I think after this,
he'll be doing that himself.

360
Rachel!

361
Wow!

362
You...
You look...

363
Wow!

364
And I still have about
five seconds to spare.

365
That was about 7 seconds.

366
So we're a little late.

367
Come on.

368
Oh, and by the way...

369
What?

370
I'm going commando too.

371
Dr. Geller?

372
- Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.
- What a pleasure.

373
I was quite impressed with your
paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

374
Yes, it confirmed everything
I'd written.

375
Excuse me.

376
Hi.

377
Yes?

378
You're kind of sitting in my seat.

379
What do you mean, your seat?

380
- I mean, I was sitting there.
- But you got up.

381
But I never left the room.

382
But you left the chair area.

383
All right, that's it.
Give me your underwear.

1
Wait a minute.
You're telling me this actress person...

2
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

3
Yeah.

4
Oh, my God.

5
Is this what it's like to be you?

6
- Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
- Oh. You have no idea.

7
And when we're on-stage,
I get to kiss her and touch her.

8
But then she goes home
with the director...

9
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

10
Oh, it's so great to see you
feeling like this.

11
- Hey.
Hey.

12
Monica, uh, Dad called this morning...

13
...and, uh, Aunt Sylvia passed away.

14
Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
We were all pretty shaken up about it.

16
Wait, am I missing something?

17
Because I always thought death
was supposed to be sad, in a way.

18
Well, uh, Aunt Sylvia was...

19
...well, not a nice person.

20
No, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

21
And I'm sorry she died.

22
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

23
- You get the dollhouse.
- I get the dollhouse.

24
Wow. A house for dolls. That is so cool.

25
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

26
Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel
for a dollhouse?

27
No, just a barrel.

28
You know what?
You can play with my dollhouse.

29
- Really? Really?
- Any time you want.

30
When I was younger, all I wanted to do
was to play with this dollhouse.

31
But no. It was to be looked at,
but never played with.

32
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.

33
- Hey, Sophie.
- Hey, Rach.

34
Hey.

35
Thanks for lunch, Chandler.
You didn't have to walk me here.

36
Oh, that's okay. No problem.

37
Honey, you do realize we don't keep
the women's lingerie here in the office.

38
Yes, I realize that.

39
- Summer catalog.
- That's the stuff.

40
Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.

41
Hello. You don't work for me.

42
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

43
Bing? Heh. That's a great name.

44
Thanks, it's Gaelic for,
"Thy turkey's done. "

45
- So, uh, I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
- You too.

46
Bye, Chandler.

47
So, uh, what's wrong with him?

48
Oh, nothing. He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.

49
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, is he, um, married
or involved with anyone?

50
No, no. He's not married or involved
with anyone.

51
Oh, Rachel...

52
Actually, you know what? Forget it.

53
- I'll ask him for you if you want me to.
Would you?

54
Or is it just too sad and desperate...

55
...you know,
something that Sophie would do?

56
- I am here.
- I know that.

57
Look at it.

58
Oh.

59
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

60
Carpet's a little loose.

61
Hardwood floors?

62
- Hey. Oh!
Hello.

63
Oh, Monica.

64
- It's so beautiful.
- I know.

65
- So I'm here, ready to play. Hee-hee.
- Okay.

66
I brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out. Ha, ha.

67
What's this?

68
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

69
Not one that can pee on the roof.

70
Well, maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

71
And is this in case the house sneezes?

72
No. No, that's the ghost for the attic.

73
- I don't want a ghost.
- Well, nobody wants a ghost.

74
But you've got one...

75
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient Indian burial ground.

76
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

77
...and an ancient Indian burial ground?

78
Ha, ha. That would never happen.

79
Okay, obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. Government. Ha, ha.

80
- Hey.
Hey.

81
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. What's up?

82
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

83
Heh. I know.

84
Well, if something comes up...

85
Well, I'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

86
Okay. My boss, Joanna. When you left...

87
...she started asking questions
about you.

88
Ha, ha. Liked what she saw, huh?

89
Dug my action, did she?

90
Checking out the Chan Chan Man.

91
That was...

92
...surreal.

93
Okay, what do you think?
You interested at all?

94
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive.
I'll do it.

95
Oh, thank you, Chandler.
This is great. She's gonna love me.

96
Okay, dinosaur attack.
Quick, everybody into the house. Aah!

97
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?

98
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

99
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian, and they just don't go.

100
Okay.

101
Fine.

102
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

103
Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering
around the subject...

104
...I just have to say that dinosaurs,
they don't go, "Ruff. "

105
The little ones do.

106
Hey, Kate.
- Morning.

107
Listen, I, uh, went to that restaurant
you talked about...

108
Hey, lovely.

109
Come, talk to me for a minute.

110
And I ate the food. It was good.
I had the fish.

111
Yeah, it was pretty good. Yeah.

112
Hi.

113
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

114
Oh. Hey. Joey Tribbiani.

115
I know. I'm a big fan of yours.

116
What?

117
I used to, um, schedule my classes
so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

118
...on Days of our Lives.

119
Get out of here. Really?

120
- Absolutely.
- Huh.

121
Oh, but then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

122
Yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.

123
You're so funny.

124
Listen, um, what are you doing
after rehearsal?

125
Do you wanna get a drink or something?

126
Well, uh...

127
Yeah. Yeah, sure. A drink sounds great.

128
- Cool. I'll see you then.
- Okay. All right.

129
All right. It's time to act,
my talking props.

130
- Hey.
Hey.

131
Look, everybody.
Look at my new dollhouse.

132
Wow.

133
Ha, ha. Look, look.

134
Hey, what's this?

135
Oh, okay. It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

136
Oh!

137
Very interesting, Phoebe.

138
What's this?

139
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

140
And when guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

141
This is the coolest house ever.

142
Hey. Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

143
All right.
I would.

144
Hey, guys? Guys.

145
Did you see my new china cabinet?

146
Uh-huh.

147
Watch. Watch.

148
Ooh.
- And? And?

149
Hey, my father's house does that.

150
Okay, how did it go?
Tell me everything.

151
Well, the movie was great...

152
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

153
Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big dull dud.

154
Chandler is fantastic.

155
- What?
- Oh, God. You know how people just click?

156
Like, he came by to pick me up. I opened
the door, and it was just like, "click. "

157
- Did he tell you?
- Well...

158
Oh, and he's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?

159
Oh, I know. And he's so sweet.

160
He said he'd call,
so put him straight through.

161
- Isn't this great?
- Don't spoil it.

162
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

163
What do you say?

164
Hello? Oh!

165
It's you. Just, uh... Just one sec.

166
I am going to take this call.

167
When I continue,
I hope that there will appear on-stage...

168
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

169
...committing to the moment.

170
The guy's like a cartoon.

171
What do you see in him, anyway?

172
He happens to be brilliant.

173
Which is more than I can say
for that sweater you're dating.

174
Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater.

175
It's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

176
And besides, since, uh...

177
Since when do you care
who I'm going out with?

178
I don't care.
Why? Do you want me to care?

179
Heh. Do you want me
to want you to care?

180
Do you?

181
What?

182
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.

183
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

184
I've got no reason to stay.

185
Stop.

186
Stop it. You must stop.

187
You are bad actors.

188
This is a terrible play.

189
I'll see you in the morning.

190
I can't believe we go on in a week.

191
- Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Hey.

192
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?

193
What?

194
You know, at that place I told you about
last night?

195
Oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. Yeah.

196
- I was so listening to that.
Ha, ha.

197
But, uh, you know what?
I think I need to work on my stuff tonight.

198
- Oh, okay.
Okay.

199
- I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.

200
- Okay. Ha, ha.
Night.

201
Uh, are you okay?

202
Yeah, I guess.

203
Like, what are we gonna do
about the scene, huh?

204
I don't know.

205
Well, um...

206
Maybe if it had more heat.

207
Well, how do you mean?

208
Well, Adrianne's looking for a reason
to stay, right?

209
Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...

210
He's gotta really give her a reason,
you know?

211
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

212
Or maybe...

213
Maybe he could grab her and lift her up.

214
Yeah, yeah. Then Adrianne, maybe
she could wrap her legs around his waist.

215
And then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.

216
And then he could use his teeth, his teeth,
to undo her dress and...

217
And bite her.

218
And then right when the scene ends,
he could take her...

219
...with this raw, animal...

220
Something like that?

221
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I had in mind.

222
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

223
- Hi.
- Hey.

224
It's a little early to be drinking.

225
Things, uh, finally happened with Kate.

226
- Oh. That's great.
- You're kidding. That's great.

227
Oh, it was so amazing.

228
After the lovemaking...

229
Oh, my.

230
- I just watched her sleep for, like, hours.

231
- Just breathing in...
Huh.

232
...and breathing out.

233
And I knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:

234
I'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?

235
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.

236
I'll give you a call. "

237
Oh, gee...

238
I wonder why she thinks
you're going to call her?

239
That's what you say at the end of a date.

240
You can't just say,
"Nice to meet you. Good night"?

241
To her face?

242
It's the end of the date,
I'm standing there...

243
...she's waiting for me to say
I'll call her...

244
...and it just, you know, comes out.
I can't help it.

245
It's a compulsion.

246
Come on, Rach,
when a guy says he's gonna call...

247
...it doesn't mean he's going to call.

248
This never happened to you?

249
Well, they always called.

250
Bite me.

251
- Did he call?
- No, sorry.

252
Why? Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

253
Maybe he's intimidated by really smart,
strong, successful women.

254
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

255
- Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
- Okay, okay.

256
Um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.

257
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

258
The only person that should
feel awkward is you.

259
You didn't tell him not to call me?

260
If you're uncomfortable with your friend
dating someone you work for...

261
...there are always ways to fix that.

262
Uh...

263
Call her. Call her now.

264
Multiple, so many paper cuts.

265
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why? Why?

266
I don't understand. He said he'd call. "

267
Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out.
She's gone crazy.

268
Oh. Well, give me the phone, then.

269
This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault
you haven't called her.

270
You have to call her.

271
Look, you can't call somebody
after this long just to say:

272
"In case you didn't notice,
I don't like you. "

273
Then you're gonna have to
take her out again.

274
No. She's really dull,
and she gets this...

275
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye.

276
I don't care. I don't care.

277
You'll take her out again and end it...

278
...and end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.

279
And I don't care how hard it is for you.
Do not tell her you'll call her again.

280
All right, fine.

281
But it's just a lunch date.
From now on, I get my own dates.

282
I don't want you setting me up
with anybody again.

283
That's fine.

284
- That's just a lot of big talk, you know.
- I know.

285
Mon?

286
I'm in the shower.

287
Aah! Fire. There's a fire. Fire.

288
- Hey.
- Hi.

289
So I, uh, talked to Lauren.
I kind of told her how things were with us.

290
Did you, uh...? Did you talk to Marshall?

291
About what?

292
Ha, ha. You know,
about what happened with us.

293
No.

294
And there's really no reason
why he should find out.

295
So, uh, let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

296
What are you talking about?

297
It was a big deal.

298
I mean, come on, you can't tell me
last night didn't mean something to you.

299
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.

300
Look.

301
Um, I was...
I was just caught up in the moment.

302
That's all it was.

303
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad...

304
...but haven't you ever slept with a woman
where it meant more to her than to you?

305
No.

306
- Hi, Kate.
Hi, Lauren.

307
Hi, Lauren.

308
Hi, pig.

309
Sorry I, uh... I scared you in there.

310
Oh, that's okay.

311
By the way...

312
...I was just checking
the shower massager.

313
Yeah.

314
Hey.

315
I tried to reach you at work.

316
There's been a fire.

317
What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.

318
What happened?

319
Well, we believe it originated here...

320
...in the Aroma Room.

321
All right, did everyone get out okay?

322
Well, the giraffe's okay
and so is the pirate.

323
- What is this?
- No, Phoebe, don't look.

324
You don't want to see
what's under there.

325
The foster puppets.

326
It's not a big deal.

327
It's just... It's right here,
and it's all the time.

328
Well, thanks again for lunch.

329
- Yes, this was pleasant.
- It was, wasn't it?

330
- The food there was great.
- Wasn't it?

331
So take care.

332
You too.

333
This was great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again.

334
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

335
- Rachel, any messages?
Sophie's desk.

336
Chandler. Are you gonna call her?

337
- No.
- Chandler.

338
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.

339
Okay, you are gonna tell her.
You're gonna tell her now.

340
Ow, I'm not gonna call you.

341
What?

342
I'm sorry.

343
I'm sorry that I said I was going to
when I'm not.

344
Ugh. Look, this has nothing
to do with you.

345
And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.

346
I have serious, serious problems
when it comes to women.

347
I have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

348
...mascara goop.

349
And I'm really sorry. It's just that
this is not... This isn't gonna work out.

350
Well, this isn't how I was hoping
this would end...

351
...but I guess I have to appreciate
your honesty.

352
Yeah, okay.

353
So...

354
Well, this is great. I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime.

355
Wha... So anyway, Beth,
what I'm saying is...

356
...I should have considered your feelings
before I went home with you that night.

357
I've, uh...

358
I've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...

359
...and I'm sorry.

360
So do you think you can forgive me?

361
Great. Thanks.

362
Okay. Bye.

363
Whoo.

364
Hello, Jennifer?

365
Oh, hi, Mrs. Laurio. Is Jennifer there?

366
Oh, she's not home, huh?

367
Well, uh, actually I kind of need
to talk to you too.

1
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

2
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

3
- Oh, my God. They took my idea.
- That was you?

4
Yeah.

5
Okay, there you go.

6
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

7
Oh, that's so... Aah!

8
Ow!

9
- Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?
- You all right?

10
Oh, my.

11
Hey.

12
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

13
Oh, so that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

14
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

15
Okay? You should come out
with Ross and me.

16
I mean, anything is better than sitting
around here crying all day about Kate.

17
Hey, I was crying because...

18
Because nobody believed Quincy's theory,
okay?

19
- Hey. I'm gonna be on TV.
Hey.

20
- No way.
Yeah.

21
They're putting together this panel to talk
about these fossils they found in Peru.

22
The Discovery Channel's gonna film it.

23
Oh, my God. Heh.
Who's gonna watch that?

24
- Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.

25
Ahem, I saw a girl with that vest.

26
Thanks.

27
- Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

28
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

29
Unfortunately, the sad fact remains...

30
...that most of these little guys
won't live to see the Fourth of July.

31
Because as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

32
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

33
Because I was watching this,
uh, commercial on TV...

34
...and, man, those things are cute.

35
- Hi.
Hi.

36
Oh, Pete, you're back.
Hey, check this out.

37
Wow. Skates. Ha, ha.

38
Whoa.

39
Wow. You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

40
So how was your trip?

41
- Well...
- Oh, what did you bring me?

42
Aw, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh.

43
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

44
- You want some coffee?
- Sure, that'd be great.

45
Okay.

46
- Regular or decaf?
Ha, ha.

47
- Uh, whichever's closest.
All right.

48
- Okay.
- So ask me what I did today.

49
So, what did you do today, Pete?

50
I bought a restaurant,
and I would like you to be the chef.

51
What? Oh.

52
Can you believe
he just offered me a restaurant?

53
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

54
I mean, this has been my dream
since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

55
...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

56
I mean, I would kill for this job.
I mean, I can totally do this job...

57
...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.

58
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

59
- And you're still not attracted to him at all?
- Mm. No.

60
I mean, how could I accept a restaurant
from him? I can't.

61
I couldn't even accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

62
Yeah, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

63
- Ow.
- What, honey?

64
Ow, my side still hurts
from when you crashed into me yesterday.

65
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- I know. Ow.

66
Oh, God.

67
- Hey, you guys. Guess what.
Hey.

68
Got a job on a riverboat?

69
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

70
Guess what. You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

71
- Oh, I see. So this suit is making a point.
Mm.

72
Now that you're on your own,
you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.

73
You like it, right?

74
Absolutely. I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

75
Huh. Ross, Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.

76
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?

77
Okay, goodbye.

78
So, um, after you put the suggestion
in the box...

79
...how long did it take
for the roller-skating thing to happen?

80
Um, about three months.

81
Okay, so I guess that's about,
uh, two weeks...

82
...before the topless thing kicks in.

83
- Hey.
Hey.

84
I got you something. Open it. Open it.

85
Okay.

86
It's a chicken.

87
It's cute, huh?

88
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys,
do you know anything about chicks?

89
Fowl? No.

90
Women? No.

91
Okay, well,
they are a huge responsibility.

92
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

93
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

94
Oh, well, no problem there.

95
Easy, Lenny.

96
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

97
Okay, here's the thing.

98
Oh, no. Not "the thing. "
I hate "the thing. "

99
What's "the thing"?

100
I can't do it.

101
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

102
...but, um, see,
you have these feelings for me.

103
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what you're worried about?

104
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

105
- Huh?
- No.

106
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else, on my trip.

107
Oh?

108
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
Uh, we met on the plane.

109
She asked me if she could
finish off my peanuts.

110
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

111
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

112
Oh, that's great. I mean,
I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.

113
- And now I can work for you.
- I guess you can.

114
Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.

115
All right. You know what? I'm just gonna
roll right into that office and quit.

116
- All right.
- Okay.

117
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

118
- Good luck.
I'm quitting. Woo-hoo!

119
I'm okay. I'm all right.

120
Wow. That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

121
What?

122
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

123
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

124
So you told her there's somebody else
so she'd agree to work with you.

125
Because you figure, if you spend time
together, maybe something might happen.

126
You're good. You're good.

127
Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive.
And psychic.

128
It's a substantial gift.

129
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her, though?

130
Absolutely. Oh, I promise. Tell her what?

131
Thanks a lot.

132
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive,
but my memory sucks.

133
Okay, but this is the last time.

134
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

135
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

136
Chicken

137
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
How's she doing?

139
She?

140
Well, yeah. Don't you think it's a she?

141
I don't know.

142
I can't tell. Whatever it was,
went back in too quickly.

143
Anyway, I gotta change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

144
Excuse me?

145
What?

146
I stayed home from work
while you were at rehearsal...

147
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

148
Hey. Who was up from 2:00 this morning
until 5:00 this morning...

149
...trying to get her back to sleep?

150
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

151
Oh, here it comes.

152
Yes. Here it comes.
I'm stuck here all day.

153
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us...

154
...and then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

155
Well, I don't think so, mister.

156
Hey. I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

157
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

158
That's not what I said.
Okay, I just meant...

159
I know what you meant.

160
Did you notice that ever since
we got this chick...

161
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

162
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready
to have a chick.

163
I'll take her back tomorrow.

164
You think we'll get our 3 bucks back?

165
- Hey.
Hey.

166
Oh. Hey.

167
Listen, I have that TV thing in,
like, two hours, and I need your help.

168
Okay, what do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

169
Well, the brown one
brings out your eyes.

170
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

171
Really?

172
Ow.

173
Wow. That aspirin dance really works.

174
Ow.
- Oh, my God. Is that still?

175
I'm fine. I'm fine.

176
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

177
- Rach.
- Look, I'm fine.

178
Watch. Look at that. Uh-oh.

179
Okay, okay. Look, you've got
to go to a doctor, okay?

180
No, I have to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

181
Very big deal. There's people there
that I have to meet.

182
Yeah, and I'm sure you're gonna make
a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

183
It's nice to meet you. "

184
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

185
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

186
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

187
- Rachel.
- Look, either help me or go.

188
Fine. I'll go.

189
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

190
Sure. I'll help you.

191
Oh, good. Good.

192
Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

193
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

194
Would you please help me
with this too?

195
- Okay. Let's use this brush.
- Okay.

196
- This stuff? All right.
- Yeah. Careful.

197
Light. Okay, you know,
just sweep it across the lid.

198
- Okay, just sweep it.
- Okey-dokey.

199
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry.

200
- Ha, ha. That's poking me in the eye.
- Ha, ha.

201
I'm sorry. Close, close, close.

202
- Okay, just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

203
- Right.
- Sweep, sweep...

204
Okay, now make it even,
because we don't...

205
- What?
- We don't want it...

206
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

207
You know,
you don't wear enough of this.

208
Since when...? Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

209
Well, I... Close your eye. I just think
you're gonna like this better because...

210
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

211
Sorry.

212
Because, um, I think this will make you
a little more sophisticated.

213
Sophisticated like a hooker?

214
- Hey.
- Hey.

215
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

216
I'm checking out the restaurant
with Pete.

217
- Oh. Monica, I am so excited for you.
- I know.

218
Ooh, I have to tell you something.

219
- What?
- Well, I can't tell you.

220
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell
me something that you could tell me?

221
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

222
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to, like, all my gods.

223
Okay.

224
Does it have to do
with Ross and Rachel?

225
No.

226
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

227
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock that he keeps by his bed?

228
No, but let's come back to that later.

229
There you go.
Good enough for your party? Huh?

230
Sure.

231
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from Purchasing.

232
Come on.

233
Okay, come on. All right, I gotta go.
So good luck at the party, okay?

234
Oh, wait, Ross. Could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

235
Sure. Okay.

236
Okay. Okay, great.
Um, okay, just turn around.

237
- What?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

238
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.

239
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

240
Yeah, but that was different, you know?
We were going out then.

241
Now it's weird.

242
Rach, you know,
I can see you naked anytime I want.

243
- What?
- Ha, ha.

244
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See? Woo-hoo.

245
- Ross, stop that.
- I'm sorry.

246
Come on. I don't want you
thinking of me like that anymore.

247
Uh, sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

248
It's one of my, uh, rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

249
Huh? Oh. Oh, yeah.

250
- Stop it. Cut it out. Cut it out.
- Okay, okay.

251
I'm sorry. It will never happen... Uh-oh.

252
Wait a minute. Wait, wait...

253
Now there are a hundred of you,
and I'm the king.

254
- Ross...
- Oh, come on.

255
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

256
All right. Fine.

257
- Yowza.
- Okay.

258
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

259
- Okay, that's it. Ow!
- Oh, come on.

260
Oh, my God. All right, look, look, okay.

261
Rach. Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

262
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay.

263
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

264
Oh, wait, wait,
you're not gonna come with me?

265
Of course I am.

266
Uh, I just have to make a call.

267
- Okay.
- Okay?

268
Thank you.

269
Ow!

270
What's wrong?

271
I'm sorry. I just can't go to the hospital
looking like this.

272
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

273
Does it involve clogs?

274
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

275
- Clogs.
- No.

276
- Claws?
- No.

277
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel
or Chandler or Joey.

278
- What about Pete?
- No.

279
What is it?

280
- What about Pete?
- I don't know.

281
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

282
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't.

283
- Okay, you know, I gotta go.
- But you're so close. No.

284
Something to do
with Pete's company?

285
Ugh. Just go. You're never gonna get it.

286
I know.

287
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

288
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

289
I love you both.

290
But in very different ways.

291
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
Ooh. Ah.

293
What are you doing?
I though you were gonna take her back.

294
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

295
So then I took her to the shelter.
And you know what I found out?

296
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her.

297
And I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

298
Okay, good, good, good.

299
Because I was kind of having
second thoughts too.

300
Okay. And it's not just chicks, you know?
It's all kinds of other animals.

301
That's horrible.
Well, you did the right thing, man.

302
Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.

303
Oh, funny story.

304
I don't believe this.

305
Wow, look at this refrigerator.
It's gigantic.

306
I mean, I could live in this thing.
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold.

307
Oh, my God. Look at these spider burners.
I love spider burners.

308
So you like it?

309
Oh, it is so perfect. Thank you so much.

310
- You're welcome.
- Oh.

311
Did you just smell my hair?

312
No. No way. What? No.

313
- Oh, God.
- What?

314
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

315
No. I'm just excited about the restaurant,
that's all.

316
- Pete?
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

317
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all.

318
It's really nice.

319
Look, the only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

320
Yeah, you may be okay
with getting hurt...

321
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

322
- That's why I can't take this job.
- What?

323
Well, we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

324
I'm sorry.

325
Okay. Yeah.

326
I mean, if that's really what you want,
okay.

327
Okay. Bye.

328
I'm sorry things didn't work out...

329
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

330
Oh, wow.

331
Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?

332
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

333
Hey, now, you stay out here
and you think about what you did.

334
- That's a duck.
- That's a bad duck.

335
- How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
- Oh, it was... No, no.

336
What thing? What thing?

337
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

338
Easy.

339
Okay, now, when you come back...

340
...I hope you remember
that that chick is not a toy.

341
What thing? What is this thing?

342
Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

343
Oh, my God.

344
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

345
Ah, I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

346
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

347
- Come on.
- I cannot believe you.

348
- What?
- That is the sweetest thing.

349
You should get some sleep.

350
Okay.

351
- So I'll, um...
- I'm sorry I spoiled your evening.

352
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.

353
So I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

354
Mm-hm. Yeah.

355
See you.

356
What did you do?

357
What you doing?

358
Having a swim.

359
What about the chick?

360
Chicks don't swim.

361
Are you sure?

362
I don't know.

363
- Should we try?
- Sure.

364
See, I told you. They don't swim.

365
- Well, give him a minute.
- No.

366
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.

1
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?

2
I was supposed to call my dad back,
like, two hours ago.

3
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
He said call him as soon
as you get a chance.

5
- He's at Flimbees.
- What's Flimbees?

6
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use
when I can't remember the real thing.

7
Okay, hang up. That's it. Come on.

8
No. Rachel,
that's what they want me to do.

9
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through...

10
...they're not gonna fix my crappy,
broken phone for free.

11
We cannot let them win.
It's us versus them.

12
Yes.

13
- Hey.
Hi.

14
Uh, listen, I gotta double-check
for tickets tonight. Who got what?

15
I have one.

16
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

17
My boyfriend.

18
I have a boyfriend now.

19
Two it is. Ross, how about you?

20
Uh, yeah, I, uh... I also need two.

21
Really? Who's number two?

22
Whose Number Two?

23
One of the more difficult games
sewer workers play.

24
Uh, no one, it's just this person.

25
Like a date-type person?

26
Yeah, kind of.
Uh, it's this woman from work.

27
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

28
No. No, not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself so...

29
But you said one ticket.

30
I meant me plus one.

31
Okay. Did, uh, you guys mean
you plus one?

32
- All right. I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

33
- Okay. Bye-bye.
Bye.

34
Bye-bye.

35
Okay, I need a date.

36
Oh, hey. You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate.

37
And I, uh, borrowed some of your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

38
What are you doing?
That's never gonna happen.

39
- She's seeing somebody.
- Yeah. And I don't have any cologne.

40
- Green bottle next to the shaving cream.
- Oh. Worm medicine for the duck.

41
- Here you go. You can wear this.
- Thanks.

42
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

43
Oh, I'm setting the phone down.

44
But I'm still here.

45
Just don't go anywhere. I'm still here.

46
Don't switch or anything,
because I'm right here. Just one sec.

47
One sec. One second.

48
- Wait. One second. Just...
- Phoebe?

49
What? Monica, I'm scared.

50
Okay. Honey, that's a sleeve, okay?

51
And we also have speakerphone.

52
Please stay on the line.

53
Your call is important to us.

54
You gotta hang up.
Because we're gonna be late.

55
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

56
Yes. Yes. I'm the next caller.

57
You were gonna have me hang up.

58
Hey.

59
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

60
- Of course not.
- No.

61
Okay, I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

62
- Hey. Hey, Rach. Hi.
- Oh, hi, how are you?

63
- Good.
- Hey. Ha, ha.

64
- Ahem. Looks like we're the first ones here.
- Yeah, looks that way.

65
First ones here.

66
Hmm. Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

67
Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. Cailin...

68
- Sorry.
- Oh.

69
- And break.
Ha-ha-ha.

70
Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

71
- Okay. I'll get our seats.
I'll join you.

72
So, uh... Well, this is, uh...

73
This is awkward.

74
Yeah?

75
Well, you know, because Rachel and I
used to go out. Ha, ha.

76
Oh, I didn't know that.

77
Oh.

78
Well, then this is awkward.

79
- So, what do you? Oh. Yeah.
- I think we're here. Yeah.

80
Uh. Huh.

81
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

82
I think you may be in our seats.

83
Um, no, I don't think so.

84
- Could we take a look at your ticket?
- Sure.

85
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13."

86
- And...
- Oh, well, I thought that...

87
You thought, huh? Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out too well for you. Idiot!

88
What are you, a moron? Huh?
It says, "D-13." Okay?

89
Look, you're surrounded by even numbers.
Does that give you some clue?

90
- Well, the usher told me...
- Oh. Oh, the usher must be right.

91
What, with all his training they go through.
Get out!

92
Here.

93
- Hey, man, you want the aisle?
- No, I'm good.

94
There he is.
There's our star.

95
You were great.

96
So? So? What'd you think?

97
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

98
- I wasn't in that.
- I know.

99
Hey, Kate, listen I want you to meet
everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

100
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart.
- Hi.

101
Come.

102
So that's the girl you like.

103
I'm telling you,
this guy Rachel is with is crazy, okay?

104
He viciously screamed at total strangers.

105
I think he's bad news.

106
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?

107
Well, that's odd.

108
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys,
this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.

109
- Hi.
- Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

110
Oh, yeah. I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

111
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

112
So how'd you guys meet?

113
Well, uh, the short version is,
I pursued her for a couple of months.

114
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

115
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

116
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.

117
Hey, you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

118
How do you do?

119
Oh, you two girls were outstanding.

120
Do they have representation?

121
They weren't in the play.

122
- Huh. We're not actors.
Oh. What a shame.

123
Because with her face
and her chest...

124
...I could really put something together.

125
Could I borrow it?

126
Hi. Remember me?

127
Hi. Yeah. Ahem, Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

128
...and someone just cut in front of him.
I think he's gonna snap.

129
- Ross, I'm gonna go.
- Go? Why?

130
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like...

131
...standing around all night, waiting
for some guy who may or may not scream.

132
Oh, but Cailin...

133
...he definitely will scream.

134
Goodbye, Ross.

135
Oh, go, all right.

136
Here we go, people.

137
Ahem, "Boxing Day.

138
The Lucille Lortel Theatre... "

139
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da. Aha.

140
"Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

141
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production. "

142
Yes. Ha-ha-ha!

143
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable. "

144
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, aha!

145
Here it is. "The direction...

146
...by Marshall Townend is... "

147
Thank you, boys and girls.

148
You've ruined my life.

149
Please stuff your talentless faces...

150
...with my mother's crab cakes.

151
Excuse me.

152
Does anyone mind if I save this?

153
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
- Oh, is the play over?
- Yeah, where were you?

155
Thank you for your patience.

156
You're the next caller.

157
You were the next caller five hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

158
No, I've kept myself busy.

159
Oh, okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

160
Hey.

161
You okay?

162
Fabulous.

163
Listen, drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

164
- You know what you should do?
- Become a drama critic.

165
I am hurt.

166
A plague...

167
...on both your houses.

168
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

169
Oh, classy.

170
Yep.

171
I sure know how to pick them, huh?

172
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

173
Wow.

174
Yeah, I, uh... I gave up a job too.

175
- Really? What?
- Uh, declawing cats.

176
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

177
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of their Times and The Post.

178
- Why The Post?
- You didn't see The Post?

179
- No. You?
- No. Why?

180
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

181
Oh, absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

182
Aw, you're sweet and cute.

183
I know. That's why they trashed me.

184
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What?

185
I don't get you.

186
I mean, first you hate me.

187
Then you sleep with me.

188
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

189
What? So you never went out
with an actress before?

190
Kate, do you even like me?

191
- Of course I do.
- So how come you blew me off?

192
- You know, how come you were with him?
- I don't know.

193
I just do this.

194
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

195
...or the most talented guy.

196
Why can't I just pick someone like you?

197
Thanks.

198
You know what I mean.

199
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

200
Joey, you're just so...

201
You're so...

202
...so...

203
Okay. Okay, okay. Ha, ha.

204
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

205
Good night, Kate.

206
Sweet dreams.

207
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

208
Please stay on the line.

209
Your call is very important to us.

210
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep, honey.

211
- This isn't healthy.
- No, no, I'm fine.

212
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

213
- Hey.
Hey.

214
Didn't you have that outfit on last night?

215
Yeah. I stayed at Kate's,
but, uh, nothing happened.

216
Hey, Pheebs, where were you?

217
I'm so, so sorry, Joey.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

218
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

219
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

220
- Anyway, how'd it go with Kate?
- Oh, it was great.

221
Yeah, I walked her home...

222
...and it was amazing
how much we connected, you know?

223
Then she passed out.

224
But then she woke up. Yeah.

225
And we stayed up all night talking.

226
And now we're, like, totally crazy
about each other.

227
- Joey, you had "the night. "
- What?

228
When two people finally realize
their feelings for each other...

229
...and they talk for hours and they learn
all about the other person.

230
You think?

231
- Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family?
- Two brothers. One died.

232
- Yes.
Yeah.

233
This is from the woman at the bar.

234
Oh.

235
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

236
- What time is it?
- One.

237
Seven-fifteen.

238
Watch doesn't work.

239
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

240
Look. Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but...

241
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

242
- You don't?
No.

243
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

244
Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

245
No, it's not just because I'm jealous.

246
I mean, I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not jealous, okay?

247
Look, the guy, he screamed...

248
...he actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

249
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he...

250
He got up, you know, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

251
Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want
to believe me, no, that's fine.

252
- We're kidding. Ross.
- Ross. Ross.

253
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny.

254
- Whoa.
- Sorry, Tommy.

255
What's in the cup, Ross?

256
- Um.
- What is in the cup?

257
Okay, it's coffee.

258
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee.

259
- It's hot...
- Hot coffee!

260
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

261
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

262
Huh? Huh?

263
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

264
Hmm, going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

265
Yeah.

266
- Hey.
- Tommy.

267
Say, what's your favorite thing
about summer?

268
Ooh, I don't know.
Probably the, uh, smell of freshly cut grass.

269
- Aw, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

270
Hey, sorry. Sorry I'm late. My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

271
- Look, we held the curtain for you. Let's go.
- Okay.

272
Vic. Where have you been, baby?

273
- Where's Kate?
- She got a job in L.A.

274
What?

275
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

276
Where have you been, Vic?

277
Oh, uh... Go to the window.

278
I wanna run down to the truck
and show you something.

279
What do you got down there, Vic?

280
What do you got under that tarp?

281
When is she leaving?

282
Tonight. What are you doing?

283
I'm coming up.

284
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

285
Why don't you use ours across the hall
because she...

286
...has problems.

287
Thanks.

288
Whoa. Whoa.

289
Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled
this hot coffee on you.

290
Ha, ha. Yeah, but you didn't. Ha, ha.

291
No, but it's hot.

292
Ross, would you just stop it?
It's getting really old.

293
I can't believe no one believes me.

294
I do. I believe you.

295
You do, Pheebs?

296
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

297
Ooh, hey.

298
Hey there, little fella.

299
Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how you doing?

300
Aw. Aw, ew. Oh. Ew.

301
Gross.

302
Idiot!

303
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

304
"Oh, look at me. I'm so cute.
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

305
God, you're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

306
What are you quacking about?

307
Dumb Donald Dodo!

308
Step away from the duck.

309
Ooh, sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

310
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

311
Well, I guess we're not
going out anymore.

312
Man!

313
- Joey.
- Kate.

314
I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

315
What's going on?
What's all this about L. A?

316
They still want me for General Hospital.

317
But what about us?

318
Last night was wonderful.

319
But I can't stay here just for you.

320
Well, so stay for the museums.

321
- I'm sorry.
Joey, on-stage.

322
Well, can you stay
till the end of the play?

323
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

324
Where are you, Vic?

325
Flight's in an hour. I gotta go.

326
Vic?

327
Vic?

328
- Vic!
- In a minute.

329
So this is it, Victor?

330
Yeah. I guess it is.

331
Listen, I, uh...

332
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

333
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

334
But you got things you have to do now.

335
And so do I.

336
And so...

337
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

338
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

339
But when I return
200 years from now...

340
...you'll be long gone...

341
...but I won't have aged at all.

342
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

343
...to look me up.

344
Because, Adrianne...

345
...baby...

346
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

347
So long, Vic.

348
Phoebe, it's been two days.

349
Yeah, I know.

350
Ugh, good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

351
Phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is Utah.

352
No, no, no.

353
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

354
Every...

355
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

356
Phoebe.

357
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I will pay you back.

358
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

359
- Hang up.
- Hang up the phone.

360
Fine. Fine.

361
Oh. Oh.

362
What?

363
Well, I think I broke it.

364
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.

365
Oh.

1
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a little baby?

2
We could call it Chuck.

3
Or Dick.

4
- Hey.
Hey.

5
Listen, I need a favor.

6
I was in the shower, and as I was...

7
...cleansing myself, I, uh...
Well, I felt something.

8
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

9
No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

10
Well, what was it?

11
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not...

12
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

13
...could help me out.

14
- Whoa!
- Whoa! No.

15
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

16
Hey, hey, hey.

17
Huh.

18
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

19
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

20
Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?

21
No, it's...

22
...fancier than a pimple.

23
- Look, Ross, just go see a doc...
- Guys, what's...?

24
Okay, well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

25
- Yeah, right.
- Ah.

26
And, um, this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

27
- Good deal.
- Yeah, and these are my friends.

28
People? This is Vince.
Vince, the people.

29
Hi.

30
- Hey.
- Vince is a fireman.

31
Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building before?

32
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

33
Well, you know, if Joey and I
play with matches...

34
...we could get you up to an even 100.

35
- Fire safety is not a joke, son.
- Ha, ha. Oh.

36
You're right. I know.

37
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.

38
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.

39
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.

40
But I thought you just started dating
that teacher.

41
- Oh, Jason?
Yeah.

42
Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight.
Ahem.

43
Well, Pheebs?

44
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

45
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field, you know?

46
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?

47
You know, this kind of, like, you know,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

48
So, Pheebs, do they know
about each other?

49
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

50
Okay, no, they don't know.

51
- Hey, guys.
Hi.

52
Well?
- How'd it go at the doctor's?

53
Well, he said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

54
- Well, what is it?
- He couldn't even tell me.

55
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

56
And the worse thing is, he said
not being able to identify it...

57
...he was reluctant to remove it.

58
You know what?
You should go to my guy.

59
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple...

60
...he just lopped it right off, you know?
- Yeah?

61
- So I guess I'm lucky.
- Heh.

62
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

63
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

64
Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.

65
You know? They'd call it The Ross.

66
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

67
Yeah, that'd be cool.

68
Pete's breaking up with me.

69
What?

70
Yeah, I just checked my messages.

71
He said that when he gets back
from Atlanta, "We need to talk. "

72
- And?
Well, that's it.

73
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

74
Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

75
Yeah.
- Really?

76
Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

77
And I know I'll never get rich doing it,
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...

78
...knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

79
That is so great.

80
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

81
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.

82
- Uh, we'd better call the fire department.
- No. No.

83
- No, no?
- Well, we don't need a fireman.

84
We need, like, a good mechanic.

85
Oh, my God. Here they come.
We gotta get out of here.

86
Wait. Why?

87
Look, if I wanted to see a fireman,
I would date one, okay?

88
That's all it is, a third nipple.

89
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.

90
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

91
Take your shirt off and let's see
what we're dealing with here.

92
What are you doing?

93
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

94
- Well, that's not a third nipple.
- Oh?

95
First of all, it's on your ass.

96
Well, then what is it?

97
Wait a minute. Hold it.

98
- Jansen, will you come in here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton.

99
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

100
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

101
You know what? If he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

102
Well, if he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should water his plants...

103
...if you know what I mean.

104
Or, ha, ha...

105
...we could go over there
and pee on them.

106
I can't take it, you know?

107
I'm always afraid one of them
is gonna catch me with the other.

108
It's making me crazy.

109
Well, honey, why don't you
break up with one of them?

110
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to playing the field?

111
Well, it doesn't feel
like playing anymore.

112
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

113
- So, Pheebs, pick one of them.
- Yeah, which one do you like more?

114
Well, Vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

115
You know?
He's just so burly, so very burly.

116
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with Vince.

117
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

118
- Well, sensitive is important. Pick him.
- Yeah.

119
Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

120
Jason is not a sissy.

121
Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.

122
You know, I have dinner plans.

123
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

124
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years...

125
...and I'm stumped.

126
Okay, this is the den.

127
All right, check this out. Lights.

128
Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.

129
Lights, go away.

130
Aw, see? You just need
to find the right command.

131
Yes. And the dimmer switch.

132
Whoa. For a rich guy,
that's a pretty small TV.

133
No, no, no. That's the videophone.

134
But hey, guys, you're not supposed
to be here, so please don't touch anything.

135
IKEA, this is comfortable.

136
This place is amazing.

137
- Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen.
- I know.

138
No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.

139
The refrigerator told me
to have a great day.

140
Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.

141
Joey, put that down.

142
Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.

143
- How the hell do you answer a videophone?
- Monica?

144
I guess that's how.

145
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

146
Oh, it's good. It's, um... It's good.

147
Just here, watering the plants.

148
Well, don't forget that ficus
over there by Rachel.

149
Ha. Chandler's on the couch.

150
Yeah, I see him. You guys
are just the worst hiders ever.

151
- Hi, Pete.
- How you doing?

152
Uh, Pete, um...

153
The other day when you said
you needed to talk...

154
...um, just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

155
Oh, it's good news.
No, it's definitely good news.

156
Hold on a second, I have another call.

157
Hey, how's it going?

158
No, no, no, it's still me.

159
No, it's not.
I've got picture-in-picture here.

160
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

161
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

162
Oh. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll see you soon.

163
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you.

164
We love you too.

165
Okay.

166
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

167
- So, what do you think the good news is?
Look at this.

168
He wrote a check for $50,000
to Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.

169
Oh. Sorry. Uh, what do you think
the good news is?

170
Oh, my.

171
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire.

172
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone.
Call Mom. Call Mom.

173
Hello?

174
And that's Pete's mom. Ha, ha.

175
No, Mon, you have to make it
a theme wedding.

176
And the theme could be:

177
"Look How Much Money We've Got. "

178
You know? I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

179
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

180
And, uh, you could start
with a money salad.

181
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

182
Would you stop?

183
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.

184
Yes, but this is Pete, okay?
He's not like other people.

185
On your first date, he took you to Rome.

186
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

187
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

188
Monica's right. We're talking about
getting married here.

189
Okay? She can't just rush into this.

190
Oh, what do you know?
You married a lesbian.

191
All right. I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

192
Oh. So you're going with the teacher,
huh?

193
Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive, you know?

194
And in the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

195
...just, like, a really, really,
really nice body.

196
Jason. Definitely Jason.

197
- Wish me luck.
Good luck.

198
Oh, my God.

199
Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

200
Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?

201
Oh, sure.

202
- Vince.
Yo.

203
Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

204
So, what's up?

205
Um...

206
Wow.

207
This isn't gonna be easy. Um...

208
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

209
Uh-huh.

210
Good deal.

211
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

212
It's just that, uh, I thought
we had something pretty special here.

213
An you know, I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

214
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

215
- Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so...
- I'm sorry. I can't talk.

216
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

217
Wait. Wait. Wait.

218
I'm telling you, if you wanna take care
of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

219
Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs.
I don't wanna make it savory.

220
You know, when girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

221
...they tell their friends about it.

222
Give me that.

223
Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

224
Bride's magazines?

225
Yes, and I know that you said
you'd say no if he asked you...

226
...but I'm sorry, how great would you look
walking down the aisle...

227
...in this Donna Karan?

228
Oh, you so would.

229
Oh, you should get that anyway.

230
Well, for clubbing.

231
It is so weird.

232
I know what I said. But, um, this morning...

233
...I was lying in bed, I was imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

234
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

235
...and it's totally not like me
to do something like this.

236
But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?

237
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

238
And I know that we want
the same things.

239
And when I thought
about saying yes...

240
...it made me really happy.

241
Oh, my God.

242
I know.

243
I need more pie.

244
Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

245
You didn't break up with that fireman?

246
No, that was my way of telling you.

247
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

248
He keeps a journal and he paints.

249
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

250
Wow.

251
He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know,
he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

252
So then are you gonna dump Jason?

253
Well, yeah, because I have to break up
with someone and...

254
Okay, so Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is Vince.

255
Plus Vince has the body. You know?

256
So...

257
It's really just about the math.

258
- Jason.
Yeah, come on in.

259
Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious
on the phone.

260
Is, uh, anything wrong?

261
No.

262
You must be Ross.

263
- Hi.
- I am Guru Saj.

264
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so...

265
Well, relax. If it makes you
feel any better, I've attended...

266
...some of the finest medical schools
in Central America.

267
Well, then, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

268
Come on, have a seat.

269
Aha.

270
Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.

271
What's a "kundus"?

272
I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

273
Please lie down.

274
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

275
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

276
Oh, sure. We should see results...

277
Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.

278
What? What?

279
We appear to have angered it.

280
We? We angered it?

281
Oh. I think I see the problem.

282
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

283
Love.

284
Oh, God.

285
Ross, there is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off...

286
...unless you start to...
- Ow.

287
- Oops.
- What was that?

288
Well, it's gone.

289
How's that?

290
Got caught in my watch.

291
Hey, ha, ha.

292
Lights.

293
Uh, romantic lights.

294
Ooh, nice. Ha, ha.

295
So, uh, there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

296
Oh, right.
I completely forgot about that.

297
Well, uh...

298
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

299
And I look at my life...

300
Yeah?

301
- And I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

302
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

303
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

304
Wow.

305
But there's one thing missing.

306
What's that?

307
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

308
Okay.

309
Monica? I wanna become...

310
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

311
You wanna what?

312
I wanna become
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

313
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

314
It's banned in 49 states.

315
What are you talking about?

316
Okay, my trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

317
...a combination of Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian street-fighting.

318
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

319
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

320
Yeah.

321
Monica, I want you there
in the front row when I win.

322
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

323
What do you think?

324
My parents will be so happy.

325
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

326
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

327
Crazy underwear

328
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

329
All right, just keep playing,
just keep playing.

330
You'll get through this. You'll be fine.

331
Okay, thank you.

332
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

333
Hey.

334
I just was passing by
and saw you were playing.

335
This is kind of cool,
seeing you up there.

336
Well, hey.

337
Whoa, hey, hey.

338
What's going on here? Who's this guy?

339
I don't know. He just started
kissing me. Get him, Vince.

340
What?

341
Yeah, okay, I've been dating both of you.

342
And it's been really horrible,
because, you know, it's been...

343
...a lot of fun for me.

344
But I like you both...

345
...and I didn't know how to choose.

346
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.

347
Phoebe, Phoebe. Relax. It's okay.
I mean...

348
We never said this was exclusive.

349
Yeah, neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

350
Really?

351
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven't been going out that long.

352
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet. Ha, ha.

353
You haven't?

354
- You have?
- Okay, well, this is none of my business.

355
I can't believe this. You slept with him?

356
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

357
You know, Phoebe,
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

358
Well, that could've been really awkward.

359
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

360
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

361
You know, I can't believe
I went out with somebody...

362
...who'd actually have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area.

363
Everything's gonna be all right.

364
Okay, Dick?

365
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

366
Whoa.

367
He's supposed to be a duck, right?
Because otherwise...

368
...this is way out of my league.

369
Yeah, yeah. He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet, he can't do anything about it.

370
- Is there something you can do?
- Hmm.

371
Let me see.

372
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?

1
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

2
...called Sample?

3
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

4
"You're in Sample. "

5
Hey.
Hey.

6
How did it go with Pete?
Tell us.

7
You're not gonna believe this.
So I go...

8
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

9
- It's a little crowded. Do you mind?
- Could you skooch?

10
Move over just a little bit.

11
Keep on skooching.

12
Thank you.

13
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I'm...

14
Why? What is wrong with me?

15
- What's the matter?
- Tim...

16
...I have a feeling...

17
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

18
How do you know?

19
- He's got access.
- I know.

20
It's a feeling you get.

21
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

22
That's the one.

23
- So you went to Pete's.
- What happened?

24
Why is this happening to me?

25
Maybe it's my wound.

26
Forget it.

27
It's not healed yet?

28
It's oozing!

29
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

30
Thank you very much.

31
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but I wanted it to come from me.

32
- What is it?
- I've been sleeping with your wife.

33
You're the gynecologist?

34
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

35
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

36
Just give me the thing, all right?

37
Enough!

38
And you are no longer my friend!

39
We are finished! Nada! No more!

40
You are a bastard for doing that!

41
Stay away from me!

42
Come back!

43
So what were you gonna tell us?

44
I have no idea.

45
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

46
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

47
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

48
He didn't ask me to marry him.

49
Aw.
- Then definitely don't take his name!

50
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

51
...Fighting Competition thingy.

52
Pete?
Why? What is it?

53
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.

54
- Oh?
- But without the costumes.

55
Oh.

56
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.

57
It's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, "There are no rules"!

58
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

59
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

60
- What's fish-hooking?
- What's fish-hook...

61
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

62
What is that taste?

63
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.

64
Thanks for the warm welcome.

65
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play. I hope you do too.

66
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

67
There is no I in "team. "

68
Yes, but there's two in "martini. "
So, everybody, back to my office.

69
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

70
It's Bing, sir.
I'm sorry. I was just...

71
No, no. I heard what you said.
Funny. I like funny.

72
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

73
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

74
That's right. Ryder.

75
Winona Ryder for six.

76
Thank you.

77
- Yeah. We have the reservations.
Yes!

78
All right, buddy! Way to go!

79
Dude, what are you doing?

80
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

81
What'd you do about it?

82
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy...

83
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

84
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay
to be that guy.

85
Maybe it's that jock thing.

86
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

87
You know, I don't understand guys.

88
I mean, I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

89
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

90
I know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

91
...stick your head in between them.

92
Can we please go eat?

93
- Yeah, what are we getting?
- Anything but stew.

94
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

95
Don't turn your back to him.

96
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

97
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

98
Then when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

99
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

100
What if Joey was President?

101
Can I ask you something?

102
- Yeah.
- Okay, you can totally say no...

103
...but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date?

104
Oh. Uh, with who?

105
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

106
...and she asked if I could set it up.

107
- But if that's not cool...
- Which one is Bonnie?

108
You remember her from
my birthday party?

109
Average height...

110
...medium build, bald...

111
Oh!

112
That's fine.

113
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

114
You are iron! You are steel!

115
Let me ask you, how come when I call
your computer support line...

116
...I have to wait an hour and a half?

117
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

118
It's just hard when I know
I have e-mail I can't get.

119
- Hi.
- Monica!

120
Hi, honey.

121
On the table. On the table, please.

122
Hey, um, so listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

123
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

124
It sounds really dangerous.

125
I don't want you to get hurt,
because I kind of like you.

126
I don't want to get hurt either.
I'm being smart about this.

127
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

128
Hoshi was a paid assassin.

129
A housepainter!
He used to be a housepainter!

130
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- I promise.

131
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

132
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

133
No! No boom-boom before big fight!

134
How about just a boom?

135
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel...

136
...from one of the kids from Fame.

137
- Ready to go to the movies?
- Mm-hm. Oh, this is Bonnie!

138
Hi.

139
This is Bonnie?

140
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

141
I can show you an I.D. If you want.

142
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time I saw you.

143
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
started wearing bras again.

144
Oh, that must be it.

145
Have fun tonight.

146
Thanks. You too.

147
You said she was bald.

148
She was bald. She's not now.

149
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

150
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.

151
Oh, well this is just perfect!

152
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.

153
I said it was okay when I thought
she was some weird bald chick.

154
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

155
- Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
- Does she have a bad personality?

156
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

157
Bing!

158
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

159
Ooh. Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

160
Come on.

161
Oh, yeah! Good one.

162
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

163
- What is with him?
- "With him"?

164
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

165
We never get smacked.

166
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

167
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

168
I'm telling you,
I need some smacks.

169
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

170
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

171
- You go to Dartmouth?
- No, sir.

172
There you go! Ha-ha-ha.

173
Hey.

174
God, Ross! What is that?

175
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

176
I saved 30 cents.
Plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!

177
From New York City, New York...

178
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

179
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

180
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

181
...Pete Becker!

182
I love you, Pete!

183
And his opponent
from Huntington Beach, California...

184
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

185
...Tank Abbott!

186
Boo! Boo!

187
Pete? Pete?

188
- That guy's pretty huge.
- Don't worry.

189
I'll use his strength
and weight against him.

190
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

191
You go get him. Let's go!

192
Here we go, gentlemen.

193
Are you ready?

194
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

195
Uh-oh!

196
Hey.

197
It's me.

198
Monica.

199
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you?

200
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

201
I thought you were nuts at first...

202
...but you did it.

203
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

204
Look back?

205
You're not gonna keep going?

206
Let me ask you a question:
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

207
Well, no. But...

208
I'm not gonna stop until I'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

209
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

210
Let me tell you a story.

211
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

212
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

213
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

214
And 862 others that I learned from.

215
Just like I learned from this fight
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

216
You didn't know that already?

217
Look, I'm gonna get better.

218
Okay? I promise you.

219
Okay.

220
Just get a lot better.

221
Fast.

222
One other thing.

223
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

224
Yeah.

225
That was the problem.

226
- How long until Pete's fight?
- About five minutes.

227
They're interviewing his opponent.

228
Apparently, he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

229
- Wow. Ha, ha. Hot dog?
- Four, please.

230
I'm really nervous.

231
Thank you.

232
So how did it go with Bonnie?

233
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

234
I actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

235
But she's really terrific.

236
It's too bad.

237
No, I'm saying I liked her.

238
There are other fish in the sea.

239
I think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

240
I hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

241
Which one's my turkey burger?

242
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

243
- Fight's starting!
- We'll be right in.

244
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

245
Nine times.

246
I had to put on lotion.

247
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

248
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

249
Fight's over!

250
Excuse me, Doug?

251
Hey there, sports fan!

252
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

253
No. I didn't do them.

254
Oh. You forgot?

255
No, I just didn't do them.

256
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

257
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

258
...or otherwise.

259
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

260
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
Ha, ha.

261
That's okay. You're still
my number one guy! Bing!

262
- Doug!
- Hmm?

263
I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

264
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?

265
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

266
No. It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...

267
...the way that you occasionally...

268
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

269
...on my buttocks.

270
Oh.

271
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate the sentiment.

272
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.

273
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

274
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

275
Bing, you're okay.

276
Okay.

277
- Ha! Ah!
- Ah!

278
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

279
...or inside his shower drain?

280
Oh, my God.

281
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

282
Look at that! It's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

283
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

284
I hope he lets her down easy.

285
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

286
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

287
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

288
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

289
Oh, God!

290
It's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

291
You said it was okay.

292
You said she was bald!

293
Was! Was, was, was!

294
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

295
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

296
Okay, first of all, breathe.

297
Second of all, I don't get it.

298
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

299
Yes.

300
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

301
Yes.

302
So?

303
It's just, you know, I didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

304
- Oh, no.
- What?

305
We killed them all!

306
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.

307
I'm not supposed to move my spine.

308
Please tell me you're stopping now.

309
I'm fine. I'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

310
Now, see this circle
I'm marking off here?

311
This is my Zone of Terror.

312
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

313
I can't until I'm
the Ultimate Fighter.

314
I will do it.

315
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

316
...me or Superman.

317
Not that I could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

318
Just sit down.

319
Please listen to me.

320
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

321
Ever!

322
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

323
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

324
Well, then you know what?

325
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

326
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

327
If you're asking me to quit...

328
...then you're asking me
to be someone I'm not.

329
I've got to do this.

330
Then I've gotta go.

331
Bye.

332
- Monica?
- Yes?

333
Could you leave a note?
I'm on painkillers...

334
...and I might not
remember this tomorrow.

335
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so I'm happy.

336
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

337
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

338
Goldberg, you maniac!

339
I love you!

340
- Bing, couldn't have done it without you.
- Thank you, sir.

341
Oh, excuse me.

342
I forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

343
Of course you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

344
Well, what about you?

345
You're not feeling left out, are you?

346
No. Heh.

347
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

348
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

349
- Yes, I do.
- Ha-ha-ha.

350
Now, get on out of here, you!

351
Pete Becker circles the ring.

352
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

353
Bruiser is charging!

354
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

355
I can't watch this.

356
Check it out! Pete's winning!

357
- Really?
- No!

358
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on
the canvas and is going for his favorite area!

359
Oh! Oh!

360
Wait! If that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

361
This is ironic.

362
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

363
And from the looks of it,
now Pete can't.

1
So, uh, your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
All right, I was 15.
It was my best friend, Ruth...

3
...and we got drunk on that hard cider.

4
And then suddenly, I don't know,
we were making out.

5
Tell it again.

6
Seriously.

7
Is that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

8
Yeah, sure. Well, you know, earlier,
she was talking about geography.

9
Joey, she was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
Well, I think we all learned something.

11
Hey, you guys. Look what I found.
Look at this.

12
That's my mom's writing. Look.

13
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1965."

14
- Do you know what that means?
- That you're actually 50?

15
No, no. That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.

16
According to her high school yearbook,
they were BFF.

17
- Best friends forever.
BOTH Oh.

18
- That's great.
- That is so cool.

19
I know. So this woman probably could...

20
Like, has all kinds of stories
about my parents.

21
And she might even know
where my dad is.

22
So I looked her up
and she lives by the beach.

23
So maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

24
Yeah, we can.
Yeah.

25
- Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.
- That's too bad.

26
Aw, big fat bummer.

27
So great. Okay, tomorrow
we're gonna drive out to Montauk.

28
Hey, Bonnie had sex there.

29
Would you look at them?

30
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.

31
I'm gonna die an old maid.

32
You're not gonna die an old maid.

33
Maybe an old spinster cook.

34
- Thanks.
- Hey, besides, worse comes to worse...

35
...I'll be your boyfriend.
- Ha-ha-ha.

36
Yeah, right.

37
Why is that so funny?

38
You made a joke, right?

39
So I laughed.

40
A little too hard.

41
What, am I not, uh, boyfriend material?

42
No. You're Chandler.

43
You know. Chandler.

44
Okay, so we've established my name,
and hit me.

45
But theoretically, say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.

46
I show up at your door and I'm,
like, uh:

47
"Hey, nice to meet you. Hey. Hey. "

48
I'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

49
Hey.
- Oh, hey. Oh, good. You bought food.

50
No, just my luggage.

51
Hey.
Hey, guys.

52
All right. Yeah.

53
Oh, I am having
the best karma this week.

54
First, I find this woman
who knew my parents...

55
...and then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

56
What about that, uh,
bike messenger you hit?

57
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

58
Hey.
Hey.

59
Hey, check out the hat.

60
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

61
I was taken aboard that hat.

62
They did experiments on me.

63
I can't have children.

64
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

65
Ross gave it to me.

66
- Aw, I think she looks good.
- Thank you.

67
Did he buy it for you...

68
...or win it for you?

69
Well, excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

70
...I'm here to tell you that hats are back.

71
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant super-hat.

72
Go, go, go.

73
Now everybody
wants to be under the hat.

74
Oy.

75
What's with all this sand?

76
Oh, yeah. Bob said
there might be flood damage.

77
Either that or he has a really big cat.

78
Well, yes, it's kind of an unusual house.

79
It has, um, three beautiful bedrooms
and, uh, no baths.

80
But, you know, the ocean is right there.

81
Knock, knock, knock.

82
Hang on a second. Come in, come in.

83
All right, so think about it
and call me back.

84
- Are you Phoebe Abbott?
- Uh, yes.

85
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott.
I'm your best friend's daughter.

86
You're Irwin's daughter?

87
I know. I mean, your old best friend.
Here.

88
- Lily? From high school? Remember?
- Oh, God. Lily. Yes.

89
Of course I remember Lily.

90
I... Then you must be...

91
Phoebe, Phoebe.

92
Phoebe, yeah.
She named me after you, I guess.

93
Uh-huh. Wow. Well. Look, there's Frank.

94
Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes.

95
- That's my dad. That's Frank. Ha, ha.
- Oh!

96
- I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
- Oh!

97
Take it easy. If you want,
there's cookies on the counter.

98
- Or sangria. I could make sangria.
- No, no.

99
- Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
- Oh.

100
So, um, anyway, um,
I've been looking for my father and, um...

101
- Have you heard from him or seen him?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

102
I guess I lost track of everybody
after high school.

103
Oh.

104
Okay.

105
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

106
Oh, well, you know,
we were always together.

107
The other kids had a nickname
for the three of us.

108
- Oh, what? What was it?
- The Three Losers.

109
Oh, poor Lily.

110
Oh.

111
You know, I heard about what happened.
That must have been just terrible for you...

112
...losing your mother that way.

113
Yeah, no, it was great.

114
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

115
- What?
- I mean, naked game.

116
Strip poker. We should play strip poker.

117
- No.
- Are you crazy?

118
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. It's, like, a law.

119
- All done.
- Aw, thank you.

120
Okay. Who's next?

121
No.

122
No way.

123
Come on, please. I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

124
Yeah, well, if, uh...
If that's the rule this weekend...

125
- Get away.
Take it like a man, Ross. Come on.

126
No, no.
Oh, come on.

127
Big bullies.

128
No, no, no.

129
Hey.
Hey.

130
Oh. So how are we doing?

131
Bored and bored.

132
Hey, you know what naked card game's
never boring?

133
No.

134
So, what's Phoebe like?

135
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like? Ha, ha.

136
Uh, no, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

137
Oh, I think she knows
where my dad is.

138
- What?
- Cool.

139
Well, where is he?

140
She was pretending
like she hasn't heard from him in years...

141
...but I found this picture on her fridge.

142
Look, isn't this what he would
look like now?

143
- Totally familiar.
- Yeah.

144
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

145
Why would she lie to you?

146
I don't know,
but we're having dinner tomorrow.

147
I figured she's gonna tell me then.

148
You know, maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

149
...to buy me presents. I don't know.
Ha, ha.

150
- So you're all bored?
Yes.

151
All right, I'm gonna close my eyes
and point to someone.

152
And whoever I point to has to come up with
something fun to do. And we have to do it.

153
- Okay. All right. Fan out. Fan out.
- Okay.

154
Okay.

155
Ooh, you know, we could just do this.

156
Okay, um...

157
We all have to play strip poker?

158
Oh, yes!

159
Strip Happy Days game?

160
Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards,
so it was either this...

161
...or Strip Bag-of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

162
Done.

163
Okay.

164
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points. "

165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
Get five cool points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

167
It hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

168
Okay, come on.

169
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

170
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

171
Okay. "Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to Inspiration Point.

172
Collect three cool points. " Yeah.

173
Which gives me five.

174
And let's see,
who is gonna lose their clothes?

175
Um, I think I pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

176
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

177
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points. "

178
Which means I have five,
and that means I get Joey's boxers.

179
Fine. Gang up on me.

180
I got you all right where I want you.

181
Come on. Take them off.

182
Actually, you know, it's kind of cold.

183
So how about I keep my boxers on
and give you all a peek at the good stuff?

184
All right,
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

185
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

186
I'm just making margaritas.

187
Think I'll help her out.

188
- What is going on here?
- What?

189
- You're painting his toenails.
- Oh, come on.

190
Chasing him around the room.
- Monica, please.

191
He's totally flirting with you too.

192
He is, isn't he?

193
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

194
...or but it's like something...

195
Hey.

196
Hi, Bonnie.
- Hi.

197
My boss let me off early,
so I took the train.

198
- Oh.
- What are you guys doing?

199
We're playing Strip Happy Days game.

200
Cool. I'll catch up.

201
So you still don't think...

202
...I'm boyfriend material?

203
Huh?

204
Saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

205
- You didn't even take off your pants.
- Yeah, well, lucky for you.

206
- What?
- I don't know.

207
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

208
Shh. Shh.

209
Joey's asleep.

210
After he passed out, we put sand
around him to keep him warm.

211
Well, I assume the, uh, happy couple
isn't up yet?

212
Did you guys hear them last night?

213
Oh, yeah. I don't know
what they were doing...

214
...but sea turtles actually came up
to the house.

215
- Good morning.
Hey.

216
- How'd everybody sleep?
- Great.

217
Like a log.

218
Us too.

219
I'm going for a walk.

220
Good morning. Nice breasts, by the way.

221
Hey, what happened to you?

222
Oh, uh, nothing. I just felt like
hanging out here and reading.

223
Oh, the water was so great.

224
We jumped off this pier
and my suit came off.

225
Oh. Sorry I missed that.

226
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

227
Oh, ha, ha.

228
I think I brought back half the beach
in my hair.

229
It was so much easier
when I used to shave my head.

230
You know, I gotta tell you...

231
...I just loved your look
when you were bald.

232
- Really?
- Oh.

233
Because I think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

234
- Really?
- Yeah.

235
I mean, you definitely should do that.

236
- You know what? I should do it.
- Yeah.

237
You know what? Thank you, Rachel.
You are so cool.

238
Oh, stop. Go on.

239
- Now, go shave that head.
All right.

240
What's the matter, Pheebs?

241
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

242
What?
- She claims she had to go out of town.

243
She's avoiding me.

244
She doesn't want to tell me
where my father is.

245
She knows and she won't tell.

246
Aw, Pheebs, that sucks.

247
Yeah, well, don't
"Aw, Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

248
- Where are you going?
- Well, she's out of town.

249
So there's gotta be something in her house
that tells me where my father is.

250
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that
"breaking and entering. "

251
- Well, are any of those people here?
Oh, no.

252
Okay. Look, I'll do something nice,
okay?

253
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

254
Hey, everybody.

255
Wow. Wow!

256
Ha, look what you did.

257
- You wanna touch it?
- No, but it's great.

258
Come on, touch it.

259
Okay.

260
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

261
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
I was having a little chat with Bonnie,
and, uh, guess what.

263
She happened to bring up, you know...

264
...who was behind the whole, um,
head-shaving idea.

265
And now, who was it? Oh, that's right.
That's right, it was you.

266
That was her idea.

267
I just gave her a nudge.

268
She said you gave her the razor.

269
- Yo.
- Hey.

270
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

271
- Uh, no, I'm good.
No, thanks.

272
- Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay, have fun. Bye.

273
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

274
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head.

275
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I don't know.

276
You don't know?
Rach, you balded my girlfriend.

277
All right. Ross.

278
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

279
You know what?
You're the one who ended it.

280
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

281
- You still love me?
- No.

282
You still love me.

283
Yeah, so? You love me.

284
No... Mm.

285
What does this mean? What do you...?

286
I mean, do you want
to get back together?

287
No. Maybe.

288
I don't know.

289
Ross...

290
I still can't forgive you for what you did.

291
I just... But sometimes when I'm with you,
I just feel so...

292
What?

293
I just... I feel...

294
- I just...
- What?

295
I feel...

296
No. I don't care.

297
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice.

298
But I made cards.

299
Well.

300
Good night.

301
I'm going upstairs.

302
Good night.
Night.

303
Wanna play strip poker for practice?

304
Ow.

305
My ass.

306
Okay.

307
Okay, good.

308
Ooh. Shh.

309
Shh, shh.

310
Shh.

311
- Aah!
- No! Oh, it's me. It's me.

312
- I didn't wanna make any noise.
- Then don't break in.

313
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

314
I came to fill your ice-cube tray.

315
What?

316
Um, okay.

317
Okay, look. Huh. Ahem.

318
I took this picture from your fridge, okay?
Because I know that this is my father.

319
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay, and you
were standing right there next to him.

320
Now, look, I deserve to know
where I came from.

321
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

322
Otherwise, you're just mean.

323
So just tell me the truth.

324
All right.

325
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

326
My father is Chuck Mangione?

327
No, no. That's just Chuck Mangione.

328
I sold him a house last year.

329
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't
know where your father is.

330
And that's the truth.

331
Oh.

332
But, um, you're right.

333
I think that a person should know
where they come from.

334
Which is why I, uh...

335
Uh...

336
Okay...

337
I'm your mother.

338
Huh?

339
You know, I wanted to tell you yesterday,
but I just...

340
I felt all floopy, and...

341
I'm telling you.
You guys are getting back together.

342
That's not true.
She doesn't even know what she wants.

343
Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.

344
Okay, well, then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

345
Take it from a guy who's...

346
...never had a long-term relationship.

347
I know, but I really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

348
Hey.
- Aah.

349
You guys, the water is great.
You should really go in.

350
Oh, uh, no, thanks. I just had an M&M.

351
Okay. Well, good night.

352
Good night.

353
- Don't be too long.
- Okey-dokey.

354
There is not one hair on that head.

355
Hey, it'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

356
And I'm finally moving on.

357
I mean, getting over Rachel
was so, ugh, you know?

358
You know, I'm finally feeling sane again.
And now if I go up there...

359
...and I kiss her and...

360
God, I want to kiss her.

361
And it doesn't work out, right?

362
Do I really wanna put myself
through that again?

363
So let me get this straight.

364
If you go with Bonnie tonight...

365
...you're doing the smart,
healthy thing and moving on.

366
- Yeah.
- Right?

367
And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

368
Hi.

369
Hi there.

370
That's that weird voice again.

371
Let me try it again.

372
You're gonna wanna date this next guy,
I swear. Okay, come on.

373
Hi, I'm Dorf.

374
Your date for the evening.

375
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff.

1
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed.

2
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam.

3
- I've been at it since 4:00 this morning.
- Where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?

4
Went down at the docks.

5
Bet you didn't know
you can get it wholesale.

6
I didn't know there were docks.

7
Hey.

8
- Aw, is it broken?
- Aw.

9
No, but I gotta wear this thing
for a couple weeks.

10
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?

11
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...

12
...Chandler sold me out.

13
I'm sorry, Joe.

14
I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy
that it just fell out of his socket.

15
What is this? Fruit?

16
Monica's making jam.

17
Jam? I love jam. Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?

18
Because the kids need new shoes.

19
I'm going into business, people.
I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.

20
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

21
What's the opposite of man? Jam.

22
Joey, don't. It's way too hot.

23
This will just be my batch.

24
Um, that's it. No.
Hey you. J. Crew guy...

25
Yeah. Why are you following me?

26
All week long, everywhere I look,
there's you.

27
You wouldn't return my calls.
You sent back my letters.

28
- What?
- One more chance, Ursula. Please.

29
Oh. Oh.

30
Oh. Well, this is awkward.

31
- Why?
- Um...

32
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.

33
Seriously.

34
Oh. That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.

35
I am such a dingus!

36
Oh, you're not a dingus.

37
I just... I want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.

38
Before I met your sister,
I was, like, this normal guy...

39
...who sold beepers
and cellular phones.

40
Well... I mean, look, it's not your fault,
you know?

41
I mean, this is just
what she does to guys, okay?

42
Just...

43
Well, thanks.

44
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.

45
When I was in junior high school...

46
...I went through this period
where I thought I was a witch.

47
And there was this guidance counselor
who said something to me...

48
...that I think will help you a lot.

49
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student. "

50
- See what I'm saying?
- Not really.

51
Um, well, get over it.

52
I mean, you just...
You seem like a really nice guy.

53
You know, I just...
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

54
Wait, you're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.

55
- Here.
- Aah!

56
Thanks a lot.

57
Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or...?

58
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

59
You don't have to
walk behind me anymore.

60
Sorry.

61
- Mon?
- Mon?

62
"Gone for more jars.
Back later. Monica Geller. "

63
Wait a minute. Look.

64
- Look, look, look.
- What, what, what?

65
- It's an empty apartment.
- Mm.

66
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.

67
Aw, honey, come on. I have to be
at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh...

68
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.

69
Ha, ha. Whoo!

70
- There it is.
Oh.

71
- Oh, that's what you're talking about.
Ahem.

72
Hey.
- Hey.

73
Do I look fat?

74
No.

75
Okay, I accept that.

76
When Janice asked me and I said no...

77
...she took that to mean
that I was calling her a cow.

78
Okay, walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

79
Okay, well, Janice said, uh:

80
"Hi. Do I look fat today?"
And I looked at her...

81
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

82
You looked at her?

83
- You never look.
- Mm-mm.

84
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No. "

85
"Is she prettier than I am?" "No. "

86
- "Does size matter?"
- No.

87
And it works both ways.

88
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?

89
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

90
Okay. For instance, ahem:

91
Let's say Janice is coming back from a trip
and she gives you two options.

92
Option number one:
She'll take a cab home from the airport.

93
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

94
That's easy. Baggage claim.

95
Ehh! Wrong. Now you're single.

96
It's actually secret option number three.

97
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.

98
Hmm.
- Okay, this is good. This is good.

99
All right, listen, I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...

100
...at night, which I'm all for.
- Mm.

101
But, uh, you know, when you want
to go to sleep, you want some space.

102
So, uh, you know,
how do I tell her that without...

103
...you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

104
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.

105
- Okay, I'm late for work.
- Oh.

106
- Are you guys gonna come down?
- Uh, yeah. I'm right behind you.

107
- Good luck, Chandler.
Thank you, Rachel.

108
Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, honey.

109
Okay, the sleeping thing.

110
Very tricky business
but there is something you can do.

111
- I thought you were cuddly sleepers.
- No.

112
No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.

113
I'm like you. I need the room. Ahem.

114
Okay, come here. Ahem.

115
Okay. You're in bed.

116
Yeah?

117
- I'm gonna use the cushion.
- Yeah.

118
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side cuddling.

119
Now, you wait for her to drift off...

120
...and then you hug her...

121
...and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

122
And then you...

123
...roll away.

124
Hug for her.

125
Roll for you.

126
- Okay, the old "hug and roll. "
- Yep.

127
- Okay. One question.
- Shoot.

128
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

129
Remember when you were a kid...

130
...and your mom would
drop you off at the movies...

131
...with a jar ofjam and a little spoon?

132
You're so pretty.

133
- Hi.
Hey, Phoebe.

134
Hey, oh! You know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

135
You talked to him?
Are you crazy?

136
Okay, first, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it. Don't spray it.

137
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

138
I mean, he was, but just because
he thought I was Ursula. Ick.

139
And that's why... That's why he
couldn't just come up and talk to me.

140
Because of the restraining order.

141
Hmm. Not feeling better about Malcolm.

142
Oh! No, no, no, he's not like a kook.

143
No, he's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...

144
...that just got a teensy bit
carried away, you know?

145
And we just get along really well,
and he's so cute.

146
Oh, my God. You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

147
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know,
get "de-Ursula-ized. "

148
Like, you know... Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

149
Yeah, but I didn't stalk her. I mean...

150
I asked for the news,
not the weather.

151
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Mon.

152
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

153
Aw.

154
Oh.

155
Yeah.

156
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask.

157
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...

158
...or a big tub of jam?

159
Put your hands together.

160
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.

161
No more jam?

162
What happened to your jam plan?

163
Well, I figured out I'd need to charge
17 bucks a jar just to break even.

164
So I've got a new plan now. Babies.

165
Well, you're gonna need
much bigger jars.

166
- What are you talking about?
- About me having a baby.

167
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

168
The great thing about the jam plan was
I was take control of my life.

169
So I asked myself, "What is
the most important thing to me?"

170
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

171
Well, aren't you forgetting something?

172
What is, uh...?
What is that guy's name? Dad.

173
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.

174
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

175
And that's just stupid.

176
That's what's stupid?

177
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.

178
You know? And there are places
that you can go to get that stuff.

179
Down at the docks again?

180
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

181
Night-night...

182
...Janice.

183
Look at all that room on her side.

184
You could fit a giant penguin over there.

185
That'd be weird, though.

186
Hug and roll time.

187
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

188
You're rolling, and...

189
Yes! Freedom!

190
Except for this arm.

191
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

192
Okay, time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.

193
Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.

194
And one, two...

195
...three.

196
Here's my binoculars.

197
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great.

198
You know, real strong. Going strong.
Keep going.

199
These are my night-vision goggles.

200
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.

201
And these are Madlibs.
They're just for fun.

202
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. What's this?

203
Oh. This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

204
- You want to hear something from it?
- Um, not even a little bit.

205
- It's about you.
- Oh, okay, then.

206
- "I met Phoebe today.
- Ha, ha.

207
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser. "

208
Oh.

209
"And then when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

210
It was weird but kind of cool. "

211
Good. Ha, ha.

212
So, what were you thinking?

213
I was thinking what it'd be like
to kiss you.

214
- Really?
- No.

215
Oh.

216
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

217
- Oh, okay.
- Ha!

218
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

219
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!

220
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.

221
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.

222
You mean there's more than one of us?

223
You can't do this, Mon, all right?
If you do this, I'm gonna...

224
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna tell Mom.

225
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.

226
- Crazy.
- What? Why? Why is this crazy?

227
- So this isn't the ideal way to do something...
- Oh, it's not...

228
Lips moving. Still talking.

229
It may not be ideal...

230
...but I'm so ready.

231
You know, I see the way
Ben looks at you.

232
It makes me ache, you know?

233
Check it out. Jam crackers.

234
Okay. All right, how's this?

235
Twenty-seven. Italian-American guy.

236
He's an actor.

237
Born in Queens.

238
Wow. Big family. Seven sisters...

239
...and he's the only boy.

240
Oh, my God. Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule. "

241
Yeah, the Knicks rule.

242
Joey, this is you.

243
Let me see.

244
Oh, right.

245
When did you go to a sperm bank?

246
Right after I did that sex study at NYU.

247
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?

248
And that's how you bought it?

249
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

250
I'm kind of surprised
there's any of my boys left.

251
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive.

252
I mean, I've got an actual
rocket scientist here.

253
Hey, maybe I should call this place...

254
...and get them to put my
Days ofour Lives gig on here.

255
You know? Juice this puppy up a little.

256
Hey!
- Hello.

257
How's the maniac?

258
Oh, he's yummy.
We did a little kissing. Aah!

259
Phoebe, what are you doing?

260
Oh, no, no, no. You know what?

261
He's not into that anymore.
He quit for me. Mm-hm.

262
Pheebs, this guy has been
obsessed with your sister...

263
...for God knows how long, okay?

264
You don't just give up something
like that.

265
Look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything.

266
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

267
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

268
Pheebs, wake up and smell
the restraining order.

269
What should I do?

270
I think that if you really like this guy,
you should just trust him.

271
Thank you, Monica.

272
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.

273
Oh, that's what I would do. Forget mine.

274
Oh, my God. What happened?

275
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler,
he spun me...

276
...off the bed.

277
- Wow. Spinning. That sounds like fun.
- Oh.

278
I wish.

279
No, you know, he was just trying
Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

280
Ross' what?

281
You know, like, where he hugs you
and then he kind of rolls you away, and...

282
Oh, my God.

283
- Phoebe?
- Yes? Yes! Oh.

284
What are you doing?

285
Oh, I was just here
looking for my, um...

286
My part of an old sandwich.
Here it is! Oh!

287
Were you following me?

288
Um, perhaps.

289
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.

290
I'm sorry. I was just afraid
that you were still hung up on my sister.

291
So you spied on me.

292
I can't believe you don't trust me.

293
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister.

294
Just walking along, looking like me.

295
What is this, just a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?

296
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.

298
I'm so pathetic.

299
No, no, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.

300
It's because I made you quit cold turkey.

301
It's too hard, you know?

302
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore, because you're, you know:

303
Wow!

304
But, um... But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?

305
Just stalk me for a while, huh?

306
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.

307
Uh-huh. I don't know.

308
Yeah, just... Okay, look, I'm going.

309
Um, come on.

310
Ooh, ooh, behind the pillar.
Ooh, which way am I gonna go? Aah!

311
- Hey.
- Hey.

312
- Where you going?
- To the bank.

313
Huh. Sperm or regular?

314
Sperm.

315
So you're really doing it, huh?

316
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy, 37135.

317
He sounds nice.

318
I'd say so.
He's got brown hair and green eyes.

319
No kidding? Hmm.

320
- What?
- I figured you'd have picked a blond guy.

321
Really? Why?

322
I don't know.
I always pictured you ending up...

323
...with one of those tall, smart, blond guys,
name like...

324
...Hoyt.

325
- Hoyt?
- It's a name. Yeah.

326
I saw you in this... You know,
this great house with a big pool.

327
- Yeah? Is he a swimmer?
- Ha.

328
He's got the body for it. Ha, ha.

329
I like that.

330
- Ha, ha. What?
- You guys have one of those signs that says:

331
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool. "

332
We do not have one of those signs.

333
Sure you do. It was a gift from me.

334
Oh! And you have three great kids.

335
- Two girls and a boy?
- Yeah!

336
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...

337
...and they're running around
on the deck.

338
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.

339
Sure.

340
Uh, but, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.

341
Yeah.

342
Oh, Monica.

343
Wow, this guy's an astronaut?

344
That would have been cool...

345
...for, like, a day. Ah-ah!

346
I called the sperm bank today.

347
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

348
Nobody wants my product.

349
I mean, I don't get it, you know?

350
I mean...

351
...maybe if they met me in person.

352
Uh, honey, you got a little thing on your...

353
- Oh.
Yeah.

354
Get it?

355
Yeah.

356
Hello.

357
Hey.

358
Uh...

359
Chan, can I, uh...?
Could I talk to you for a second?

360
- Sure. What's up?
- Uh, ha, ha.

361
Just one, uh...
One additional relationship thought.

362
Um, something you're probably,
uh, already familiar with.

363
Uh, women talk.

1
Welcome, everybody.
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries.

2
Oh, oh! It's on again.

3
- Guys, could we please not watch this?
Shh.

4
Folks, this ever happen to you?
You go to get a nice glass of milk...

5
...but these darn cartons are so
flinging, flanging hard to open.

6
Boy, you said it, Mike.

7
Aw. Aw.

8
- There's gotta be a better way.
- And there is, Kevin.

9
- Can we please turn this off?
- No way, Kevin.

10
What if I told you
there's a new product that guarantees...

11
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?

12
Meet the Milkmaster 2000.

13
Ooh.

14
- Intrigued?
- You're flinging, flanging right I am.

15
This is his first time. He's never used this.
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.

16
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy. Ha, ha.

17
Now I can have milk every day.

18
Ah.

19
It's official. There are no good movies.

20
So let's go to a bad one and make out.

21
Ew.

22
Perhaps you would like me to turn like this
so you can bunny-bump against my back?

23
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Maybe you can tell me.

25
My agent would like to know
why I didn't show up at my audition today...

26
...the first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?

27
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...

28
...but it wasn't me.

29
Yes, it was. It was him. Uh-huh.

30
Okay, it was me.

31
- How was it you?
- Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

32
Chandler was in the closet
counting to 10 and was up to seven...

33
...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.

34
Look, I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.

35
Yep, that's my audition.
- Yeah.

36
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.

37
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.

38
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.

39
Well, Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.

40
Well, that is unfair.

41
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was totally my fault.

42
You can't.
The casting director doesn't talk to friends.

43
- She only talks to agents.
- What a sad little life she must lead.

44
Okay. Ooh.

45
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- No, I know, I know. Ooh.

46
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.

47
Um, is, um, Anne there for Phoebe?

48
She'll know what it's about.

49
Hang up. Hang up right...

50
Annie? Hi. Listen,
we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

51
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?

52
Estelle? I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her.

53
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world does not stop.

54
Is anybody else scared?

55
If Joey loses this audition,
then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.

56
Annie, you are a doll.
What time can you see him?

57
I need a pen. Pen.

58
Get the woman a pad.
Get the woman a pad. A pad! A pad!

59
Oh, now you want a pad.

60
- Hey.
- Hello.

61
Where's my boy?

62
Here's my boy.

63
And here's his Barbie.

64
What's, uh...?
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

65
He picked it out at the toy store himself.
He loves it.

66
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.

67
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

68
Yeah, it's cute.

69
Why does he have it again?

70
So he's got a doll. So what?

71
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...

72
...in show business.

73
This wouldn't have to do with the fact
that he's being raised by two women?

74
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.

75
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about...?

76
Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?

77
No? Okay.

78
Ooh, ooh. How about a Dino-Soldier?

79
You are so pathetic.

80
Why can't your son
just play with his doll?

81
I gotta go to work.

82
Has anybody seen my left boob?

83
I loved that movie.

84
Here it is. Joey, what are you doing?

85
I'm sorry. It just felt nice.

86
Joe. Joe. Answer the phone.

87
I only got one arm. You should do stuff
for me. Get me a sweater.

88
Just do it. It's Janice.

89
And if I get it,
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

90
Oh, that's great.
I'm gonna have to see her tonight.

91
Why don't you wanna see Janice?

92
Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...

93
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

94
And that's bad...

95
...because you hate chicken piccata?

96
No.

97
You didn't wanna share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.

98
All of a sudden, we were this couple.

99
And this alarm started going off
in my head.

100
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

101
Ugh. Men are unbelievable.

102
What is it with you people?

103
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

104
I know. That...

105
That's why I don't wanna go tonight.
I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.

106
Oh. You mean that guy thing
where you act mean and distant...

107
...until you get us to break up with you?
Mm-hm.

108
Hey, you know about that?

109
What do I do? I wanna get past this.

110
I don't wanna be afraid
of the commitment thing.

111
I wanna go through the tunnel
to the other side.

112
- Where there's no fear of commitment.
- Ah.

113
Do we have any...?

114
Do we have any thoughts here?

115
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...

116
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.

117
Hmm.

118
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.

119
You have a fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.

120
You're afraid of bugs.

121
Get a bug.

122
Right?

123
You have a fear of commitment.

124
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was.

125
Amazingly, that makes sense.

126
- Do you think?
- Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.

127
Jump off the high dive.

128
Stare down the barrel of the gun.
Pee into the wind.

129
Joe, if I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

130
...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing
every which way.

131
Ooh, it's your audition
from this morning.

132
Ooh.
Oh.

133
Can I use the phone?

134
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.

135
Come on, baby. Come on.

136
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.

137
Okay, well, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.

138
Very nice touch.

139
Okay, go ahead.

140
- Talk, talk, talk.
- Oh, oh. Um... Ahem.

141
Hi, Annie?

142
Fantastic.

143
- You got it.
- Oh! You got it.

144
Um, will he work for scale, you ask me?

145
Well, I don't know about that.

146
Ahem.
- Except that I do and he will.

147
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

148
I would love to have lunch with you.

149
How about we have lunch next...?

150
Oop, went through a tunnel. Ha, ha.

151
Unbelievable.

152
- Oh, thank you so much.
Ha, ha.

153
It was really fun. I mean,
I've never talked on a car phone before.

154
Oh. You are so amazing.
Could you do me this huge favor?

155
There's this one other audition I want,
and Estelle couldn't get me in.

156
Uh, I don't know.
It was fun one time, but...

157
Come on, please?
It would just be this one more.

158
Well, actually it's two.

159
- Two?
- Yeah.

160
Well, really it's three.

161
Please? You're so good at it. I love you.

162
Okay. But just these three, right?

163
No, it's four.

164
So how come you wanted
to eat in tonight?

165
Because I wanted...

166
...to give you this.

167
Oh. Are you a puppy!

168
Contact paper.

169
You never know what to say
when someone you're sleeping with...

170
...gives you contact paper. Ha, ha.

171
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go...

172
...in your brand-new drawer.

173
See, the drawer actually goes
in my dresser.

174
Oh. You didn't have to do this.

175
Yes, I did.

176
Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...

177
...and that's what girlfriends should get.

178
Oh. Well, I gotta buy a vowel...

179
...because, oh, my God. Mwah.

180
Who would've thought that someday...

181
...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?

182
Well, not me.

183
But that's what's happened.
And, uh, there's more.

184
We should take a trip.

185
We should?

186
Yup. We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.

187
And I wanna meet your parents.

188
We should take a trip with your parents.

189
I don't think we need to,
because you're tripping me out right now.

190
- Are you okay?
- No, I am.

191
Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.

192
My entire life, I have feared this place.

193
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?

194
I could probably say,
"Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.

195
You probably want us
to move in together?

196
- It doesn't scare me.
- Yeah, well it scares me.

197
I'm not even divorced yet.
You just invited me over here for pasta...

198
...and all of a sudden
you're talking about moving in together.

199
And I wasn't even that hungry.

200
You know what? It's getting really late,
and I should just, um...

201
Don't go. I've scared you.
I've said too much.

202
I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love.

203
Hey, Janice, it's me.

204
Uh, ahem.

205
I wanted to apologize in advance
for having chased you down the street.

206
Bye-bye.

207
Here you go, honey. This will help.

208
So I catch up to her and she says...

209
...this relationship's going too fast
and we have to slow down.

210
- Ugh.
- Ugh. That is never good.

211
Then I got all...

212
...needy and clingy.

213
Now, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad.
How did you leave it?

214
She said she'd call me.

215
Oh, God.

216
Ugh. Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

217
This ice cream tastes like crap,
by the way.

218
Yeah, well,
it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.

219
We save the real stuff
for the truly terminal cases.

220
When you start getting screwed over
all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.

221
Yeah, you do.

222
So you don't think I'm terminal?

223
Oh, no, not at all. You're not terminal.
We just need some damage control.

224
Okay. Okay. So should I call her?

225
No.

226
It's a critical time. If you feel yourself
reaching for that phone...

227
...you go shopping,
you get your butt in a bubble bath.

228
If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

229
She has to know you're not needy.

230
So, what you have to do is...

231
...you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose...

232
...and then act aloof.

233
So I'm not gonna lose her?

234
Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

235
I said, so I'm not gonna lose her?

236
Oh.

237
Guess who's here.

238
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben.

239
Real American hero
I'm G.I. Joe

240
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

241
G.I. Joe?
You really think he's gonna fall for that?

242
G.I. Joe? Cool. Can I play?

243
Look, Ben. It's a toy that protects
U.S. Oil interests overseas.

244
Go, Joe!

245
Hello. Oh.

246
- Phoebe, there you are.
- No, it's not. Sorry.

247
But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe.

248
Oh, Joey. Oh, okay.
See, I didn't recognize you...

249
...in those pants.

250
That TV movie I went in for,
did you hear anything?

251
I think I got a shot at it.

252
Yes, they called. You didn't get it.

253
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

254
That's okay. These things happen.

255
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?

256
You're in a terrible, terrible business.

257
I don't wanna be the person
who makes your face look like that. Ugh.

258
I'm okay. See?

259
Now you're sad and creepy.

260
You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay?

261
No, no, no, you can't quit.
You're the best agent I ever had.

262
Look, rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.

263
Not personal? They said they'd never met
an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.

264
They actually said that?

265
Yeah. Oh, God, there's that face again.
See? I can't do this job.

266
No, this is why you have to do this job.

267
Agents always lie.

268
Estelle just says stuff like,
"They went another way. "

269
But this? I can use this.

270
I can work on a new accent.

271
Yeah, okay. No.
If it helps you, okay. Yeah.

272
You'll never get me, Joe!

273
No, thank you.

274
Chandler.

275
Hello, Janice.

276
What are you doing here?

277
Uh, just a bit of shopping.

278
How have you been?

279
Are you being British?

280
No.

281
Not anymore.

282
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.

283
Were you here waiting for me?

284
Yuh-huh.

285
I'm just, uh, you know...

286
...picking up some things for a party.

287
Barley?

288
What kind of a party serves barley?

289
Well, I'm sorry if my friends
aren't as sophisticated as yours.

290
- Where is this party?
- Here in Chelsea.

291
Whose party is it?

292
- A woman's.
- What woman?

293
Chelsea.

294
Either you're seeing somebody
behind my back...

295
...which would make you
the biggest jerk on the planet...

296
...or you're pretending
you're seeing somebody...

297
...which just makes you so pathetic
I could just start crying right here.

298
So which of these two guys
do you wanna be?

299
Can I be that guy?

300
Okay, we got some more good rejections.
Lots of stuff to work on.

301
Oh. Okay. Shoot.

302
Okay. Um... Oh, the zoo commercial.

303
- I didn't get it?
- No.

304
They said that you
"weren't believable as a human being. "

305
So you can work on that.

306
Great. What else?

307
Um, the off-Broadway-play people said
that you were "pretty but dumb. "

308
- Oh.
- No, wait, I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb. "

309
Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.

310
Look, um...

311
...I really appreciate this, Pheebs...

312
...but I'm gonna have to go back
to Estelle.

313
Oh.

314
Don't get me wrong.
You're a better agent than she is...

315
...but at least with her, I don't wanna
blow my pretty dumb brains out.

316
Yeah, no, I understand.

317
- You do? Thanks. Okay.
- Yeah.

318
Sorry.

319
- Wait a minute.
What?

320
Wait a minute.

321
Did you just make all that stuff up
to get out of being my agent?

322
Oh, he caught me.

323
I am so busted.

324
That's what I suspected.

325
And then I just, you know...

326
...threw the bag of barley at her
and ran out of the store.

327
My God, Chandler, we said be aloof,
not a doof.

328
I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

329
It's time
for the good ice cream now, right?

330
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.

331
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.

332
Hello?

333
Hi, Janice.

334
Can you hold on for a second?

335
Okay. Okay.

336
What do I do?

337
I don't know. This is unprecedented.

338
If we ever did what you did,
a man would never call.

339
Hello?

340
I got it. Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off.

341
- Be sleepy.
- Yes. And grumpy.

342
What are you...? Stop naming dwarves.

343
Hello, Janice. Hi.

344
I'm so glad that you called.

345
I know I've been acting
really weird lately...

346
...and it's just because
I'm crazy about you...

347
...and I just got stupid and scared...

348
...and stupid a couple more times.

349
And I'm sorry.

350
Really?

351
Ha, ha. Really?

352
He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...

353
...she'd be sleeping
with somebody else by now.

354
I love you too.

355
Ugh. It's so unfair.

356
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?

357
Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.

358
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

359
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

360
And if you guys can't deal with it,
that's just your too bad.

361
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

362
You used to dress up like a woman.

363
What?

364
The way you used to dress up
in Mom's clothes?

365
What are you talking about?

366
The big hat, the pearls,
the little pink handbag?

367
Okay. You are totally making this up.

368
How can you not remember?

369
You made us call you "Bea"?

370
Oh, God.

371
I've literally never been this happy.

372
Wasn't there a little song?

373
Oh, please, God, let there be a song.

374
There was no song. There was no song.

375
I am Bea

376
- I drink tea...
- That's enough.

377
Won't you?

378
Oh.

379
Won't you?

380
Won't you?

381
- Won't you dance around with me?
- Ha-ha-ha.

382
I am Bea

383
I drink tea

384
Won't you dance around with...?

385
Ross!

1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
Hey.

3
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

4
No.

5
You know how we're always saying
we need a place for the mail.

6
Yeah.

7
Well, I started building one.

8
But then I decided to take it
to the next step.

9
You're building a post office?

10
No, an entertainment unit,
with a mail cubby built right in.

11
- It's a one-day job, max.
- Okay.

12
My word, those are snug.

13
Oh, yeah. These are my old work pants.

14
Sergio Valente.

15
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

16
- Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.

17
- Any sign of your brother?
- No, but he's always late, so...

18
- I thought you only met him once.
- Yeah, I did.

19
I think it sounds, you know, big sister-y,
"Frank's always late. " So...

20
Oh. Well, relax. He'll be here.

21
- Yeah, no, I know. I'm just nervous.
Oh.

22
You know, it's just, you know, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

23
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

24
It's just the "last desperate chance
to have a family" kind of thing.

25
- Mm.
- You're so sweet to wait with me.

26
Well, actually, Gunther sent me.
You're not allowed to have cups out here.

27
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

28
No, but he told me he thinks you're a fox.

29
All right. Janice likes him.

30
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her, uh, freebie list.

31
Her what?

32
We have a deal where we each pick five
different celebrities we could sleep with...

33
...and the other one can't get mad.

34
Ah, the heart
of every healthy relationship:

35
Honesty, respect,
and sex with celebrities.

36
So, Chandler, who's on your list?

37
Uh, Kim Basinger...

38
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

39
...Yasmine Bleeth...
- Oh.

40
...and Jessica Rabbit.

41
Ahem. Now, you do realize that she is
a cartoon and way out of your league?

42
I know. I just always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

43
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?

44
First I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

45
It's just a game, Mon.

46
Rach, how about you?

47
Oh, I don't know. I guess Chris O'Donnell,
John F. Kennedy Jr...

48
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

49
Spider-Man?

50
Hardy Boy.

51
- Peter Parker.
- Thank you.

52
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

53
I... Oh, that kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

54
First, I'll divide my prospective candidates
into categories.

55
Ahem. What a geek.

56
Everybody, this is Frank.
This is my half brother, Frank.

57
- This is everybody.
Hey.

58
- This is Ross.
- Hi, how are you?

59
- Chandler.
Hi.

60
- Hi.
- Joey.

61
- Hey.
Hi, hi, hi.

62
This is Monica.
- Whoa.

63
- And this is Rachel.
- Hi.

64
Whoa.

65
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

66
Hey, how do you guys
get anything done? Ha, ha.

67
We don't, really.

68
Well, so do you guys have big plans?

69
Oh, yeah. We're gonna, like, connect and,
you know, bond and everything.

70
I was thinking we could go down to
Times Square and pick up some ninja stars.

71
Oh, um, my friend Larry,
he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.

72
You know, we really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

73
Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

74
No, you didn't get me.

75
It's an electric drill.
You get me, you kill me!

76
Calm down.
Do you want this unit or not?

77
I do not want this unit.

78
Well, you should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

79
And we're out of beer.
Okay, I'm going to Monica's.

80
Fine.

81
Hey. Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

82
Oh, Monica, listen...

83
...I saw down at the hardware store
they got those designer tiles on sale...

84
...if you wanna redo your bathroom floor.

85
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

86
Nothing.
It's just old and dingy, that's all.

87
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh, yeah?

88
If you move your hamper,
you can see the color the tile used to be.

89
- Ah!
- Yeah.

90
I can't live like this.
What are we gonna do?

91
Relax, relax. Here, hold this.

92
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

93
A little more than I wanted to see.

94
Look at that.
Every inch of this is glued down.

95
It'd take forever to pry this up.
You should, uh... You should just leave it.

96
I can't leave it.
You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.

97
Uh, oh.

98
- Ah? There you go.
- Aw.

99
Yeah, that's nice.

100
You know, we can put it back there after
the surgeons remove it from your colon.

101
Ooh, ooh!

102
- What?
- Yeah.

103
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

104
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

105
And I thought, you know... I figured that
was something I got from our dad.

106
- Well, wait, you mean like this?
- Yeah.

107
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

108
You're not doing it.

109
Oh, right, okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

110
So we don't have that.

111
- When's your birthday?
- February 16th.

112
I know a guy who's the 18th.

113
That's close.

114
- When's yours?
- October 25th.

115
That's the same month as Halloween.

116
Yeah.

117
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

118
Melt stuff.

119
- Okay, I've got three of my five.
- Three of your five what?

120
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

121
God, you are giving this a lot of thought.

122
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

123
All right.
Who you got it narrowed down to?

124
Okay. Ahem. Elizabeth Hurley.

125
- Ooh, very attractive.
- Yeah.

126
Forgiving.

127
Susan Sarandon.

128
Eh, you know what? She's too political.

129
She probably wouldn't let you do it
unless you donated four cans of food first.

130
And Isabella Rossellini.

131
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Very hot. Very sexy.

132
But, uh, you know, she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.

133
- So?
- So you gotta play the odds.

134
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country, like, all the time.

135
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

136
Okay, so by "melting,"
you meant melting.

137
Yeah.

138
- So is it, like, art?
- Yeah, you can melt art.

139
- Hey, can I use your phone?
- Mm.

140
- Yeah, sure. You wanna call your mom?
- No, I wanna melt it.

141
Oh. Well, um, not right now.

142
You know what? I'm just gonna go to bed.
The fumes are giving me a headache. So...

143
Yeah. Yeah. Ha, ha.

144
Good night, bro.

145
Good night.

146
Here.

147
Just in case.

148
Oh, excellent.

149
- What kind of karate is that?
- No kind.

150
- He just makes it up.
- Hmm.

151
- So how's it going with you guys?
- So far it kind of blows.

152
I don't know, I just thought, you know,
that he'd feel more like a brother.

153
Like you and Ross.
Just close and connected and...

154
Oh. We're close now,
but you wouldn't believe the years...

155
...of noogies and wedgies and
flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and...

156
That's when the waistband
actually goes over your head.

157
Ah.

158
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

159
- How do you play the shadow game?
- How do you play the shadow game?

160
- I just asked you.
- I just asked you.

161
I don't have time for this.

162
- No, that is what the game is.
- Well, you just gave up really quickly.

163
- Have you seen Joey?
- What's the matter?

164
Oh, just this.

165
It's my fault, really, because the couch
is where we usually keep the varnish.

166
Hey, somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

167
- What's going on?
- He's retiling my floor.

168
Yo, spackle boy.

169
- Get up.
- Ah-ah. You started this, you will finish it.

170
He started mine first.

171
Build the unit, Cinderellie.
Lay the tile, Cinderellie.

172
Whoa.

173
Big octopus.

174
Yeah.

175
Hello?

176
Oh, my God. I totally forgot.

177
Well, can't someone else do it?

178
But I have company.

179
Yeah, no, look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

180
Um, I'm really sorry,
but I have to go into work.

181
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so...

182
- Hey, what kind of work do you do?
- Oh.

183
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

184
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

185
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

186
Whoa, that's wild.

187
No, I had no idea. Ha-ha-ha.

188
Alrighty. Heh.

189
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you wanna come with me.

190
You mean, like, watch?

191
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

192
You know, what are big sisters for?
Ha, ha.

193
Well, I don't think this. You know?

194
No, no, no. I wouldn't do you myself.

195
I mean, that would be weird.

196
Yeah. I'll get one of the other girls
to do it.

197
Ooh, this is so much fun. Yay! Ha, ha.

198
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

199
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

200
It's beautiful.

201
It's like the first bathroom floor
there ever was.

202
Whoa.

203
What are you going in there for?

204
You want, like, a number?

205
- Hey.
- Hi. Bye.

206
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

207
These are final.

208
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah. Very official.

209
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
Chandler printed it up on his computer.

210
And who laminated it?

211
That was me.

212
All right, let me see. Ahem.

213
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

214
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

215
...Dorothy Hamill"?

216
Hey, it's my list.

217
Okay, honey, you do realize
she only spins like that on ice?

218
Ow, ow, ow.

219
Oh. What? Whoa.
- Ow, you know? Ow.

220
- Hey, hey, what's going on?
- She broke my arm.

221
- He touched my fanny.
- No, she touched mine first.

222
That's my job.

223
So wait, what's the deal?

224
I can have sex with you
but I can't touch you?

225
Ew.

226
- You can't have sex with her.
- Did you think I was a hooker?

227
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop.

228
Okay.

229
Can you ask Mr. Wiffler
if he can wait for, like, five minutes?

230
Fine.

231
I don't like you.

232
So that's what you thought I did? God.

233
That's not what I do.

234
Wait, that...
Wait, that's not what you do?

235
No.

236
Why would you think that?

237
I don't know. I mean, you know...
This is the city, you know? I just...

238
I mean, uh...

239
...I don't know.

240
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

241
Oh, wait.

242
No, you're right. No, it was perfect.

243
I can't believe
that I screwed it up so bad.

244
You really thought it was perfect?

245
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

246
...but, you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

247
Because we had all those great talks,
you know?

248
Yeah. Um...

249
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

250
Well, you know,
about the tongue thing, you know?

251
And how I told you about my likes
and my dislikes.

252
I don't...

253
How I like to melt stuff
and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

254
Right. Okay. Mm-hm.

255
You know,
I feel like I can really talk to you...

256
...because, you know,
you're my sister, you know?

257
Yeah. I guess I do. Yeah.

258
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

259
Yeah, well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

260
You hopped a little bit.

261
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really...

262
Okay.

263
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

264
- This?
- Uh-huh.

265
Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

266
We found ninja stars.
I almost get my arm broken by a hooker...

267
She's not a hooker.

268
Well, when I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

269
Okay. On three.

270
One, two...

271
Why don't we just go on two?

272
- Why two?
- Because it's faster.

273
Yeah, I could've counted to three four times
without all this two talk.

274
- All right, but in the future...
- Okay. Heavy thing not getting lighter.

275
Okay.

276
One, two...

277
- So we are going with two?
- All right.

278
Oh, good job, Joe.

279
Wow.

280
It's big.

281
Yeah. Yeah, so big that it actually
makes our doors look smaller.

282
Maybe my ruler's wrong.

283
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

284
Look, it's not that bad.

285
So what? It blocks a little of your door,
a little of my door.

286
I got a better idea.

287
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

288
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

289
Okay, ahem,
let me just see if I've got this right.

290
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy-hazelnut...

291
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

292
Okay, great.

293
Ahem. You freak.

294
- Thank you. Ahem.
- A coffee to go, please.

295
Oh, my God. Guys.

296
Isabella Rossellini.

297
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

298
Damn. I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

299
Why? Because otherwise you'd go for it?

300
Yeah, maybe.

301
Oh, heh. You lie.

302
You don't think I'd go up to her?

303
Ross, it took you 10 years
to finally admit you liked me.

304
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated. Heh.

305
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

306
- Okay. Hold my cruller.
- Okay.

307
Rach, are you really gonna let him
do this?

308
Honey, he's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

309
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

310
Hi. Hi.

311
I'm Ross.

312
Um, you don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

313
I mean, um, Blue Velvet. Whoo.

314
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a, um, cup of coffee.

315
Or reimburse you for that one.

316
Aren't you with that girl over there?

317
Well, yeah, kind of.

318
But that's okay.
See, we have an understanding.

319
See, we each have this list
of five famous people...

320
...and you were one of mine.

321
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

322
No, no, no. It's flattering.

323
Whoa. Heh, heh.

324
- I don't know...
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait, Isabella.

325
Don't just dismiss this so fast.

326
I mean,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

327
Yeah, for you.

328
Is that the list?

329
- Um, yes.
- Can I see it?

330
- Um, no.
- Come on.

331
But... Okay.

332
I'm not on the list.

333
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.

334
It's laminated.

335
Yeah.

336
Um, okay, see, you were on my list.

337
But then my friend Chandler...

338
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

339
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

340
You know, it's ironic,
because I have a list...

341
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys...
Uh-huh.

342
...and yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

343
That?

344
We're just gonna be friends.

345
- You know what?
- Hmm?

346
Betcha I could fit in there.

347
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

348
Get out your checkbook, mister.

349
Oh, I think I have the cash.

350
You are dog, man.

351
I totally fit.

352
Yeah. You got me.

353
I'm out five big ones.

354
There you go.

355
Thank you.

356
Cha-ching.

357
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.

358
Better luck next time, buddy.

359
And the drinks are on me.

1
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

2
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

3
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

4
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

5
Over the years, none of you
ever got drunk and stupid?

6
Well, that's really
a different question.

7
I can't believe a group of people
who spends this much time together...

8
...has never bumped uglies.

9
There was that one time
Monica and Rachel got together.

10
What?

11
Excuse me, there was no time.

12
Okay, but let's say there was.

13
How might that go?

14
Okay, okay.

15
Well, then answer me this:

16
Have any of you ever almost?

17
- Anybody need more coffee?
- Hey, there's a dog out there!

18
- Ugh. That is so unfortunate.
- What?

19
Cute Naked Guy's
starting to put on weight.

20
I'll be back in just a minute.

21
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks
on the phone.

22
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

23
Oh! Then it must have been you. Bye.

24
Bye-bye.

25
- That's why I moved out.
Hey, while we're on that...

26
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

27
On some level, she already knows.

28
She doesn't know you sneak out
every night...

29
...and back every morning...

30
...and that you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

31
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

32
- Hey.
Hey.

33
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

34
Nobody good?

35
There was the guy with the ferrets.

36
That's plural.

37
The spitter. Oh! And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

38
...he made a noise
every time he said it.

39
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

40
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

41
- How many more tomorrow?
- Two.

42
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

43
...and this actor guy
who I'm not sure about.

44
When I answered
the phone, "Chandler Bing"...

45
...he said, "Whoa! Short message!"

46
Ross...

47
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

48
Your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

49
- What?
- I have to go. Heh.

50
Carol should be home by now, so...

51
- How's it going with you guys?
- Better, actually.

52
I finally figured out why we're
having so much trouble.

53
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

54
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

55
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

56
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

57
So, uh, Eric...

58
...what kind of photography do you do?

59
Oh, mostly fashion.

60
There may be models here sometimes.
I hope that's cool.

61
Yes, that is cool.

62
Uh, because I have models here,
you know...

63
...never.

64
Ooh! During the summer, I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

65
...which you're welcome to use.

66
Although I should tell you,
she's a porn star.

67
Well, I still have
one more person to meet.

68
But unless it turns out
to be your sister...

69
...ahem, I think your chances
are pretty good.

70
All right.

71
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

72
This here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

73
Don't you, uh, wanna ask me
any questions?

74
Sure. Uh... Hmm...

75
What's up?

76
Well, I'm an actor.

77
I'm fairly neat.

78
I got my own TV.

79
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

80
Ha, ha. What gay thing?

81
Uh, just, you know, in general.
The whole people-being-gay thing.

82
Totally cool with that.

83
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

84
- Hi.
- Hey.

85
Oh, my God!

86
Hey, Mon.

87
- Wanna hear something that sucks?
- Do I ever!

88
- Chris says they're closing the bar.
- No way!

89
They're turning it into
a coffee place.

90
Just coffee?

91
- Where are we gonna hang out?
- You got me.

92
- Can I get a beer?
- Did you pick a roommate?

93
- You bet.
- Is it the Italian guy?

94
Hmm, yeah, right.

95
He's so cute.

96
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with...

97
...and be referred to
as "the funny one. "

98
Table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

99
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

100
Okay, but after that
we're shooting some pool.

101
Oh, ahem, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

102
My friend ordered an onion...

103
...not an olive.

104
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

105
...which I don't think this is.

106
- I am so sorry.
That's all right.

107
How hard is it to get a couple
drinks right, huh?

108
Well...

109
I would like to propose a toast...

110
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

111
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.

112
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

113
Ugh! Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life! Heh!

114
Ahem. Yeah, I know.

115
What?

116
Oh, I don't know.

117
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

118
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

119
I don't know, I think I...

120
I feel like having
one last fling...

121
...just to sort of get it
out of my system.

122
- Rachel, stop!
- You're so bad! Ha!

123
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have...

124
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

125
With the next guy I see.

126
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

127
Yeah, so?

128
And now I've picked it up again.

129
My God!
I went to high school with her.

130
Rachel!

131
Hi.

132
Monica!

133
Look! Hi! What do you think?

134
Oh, my God!

135
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

136
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

137
Aw, just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

138
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

139
Not right now.

140
Oh, well, that's okay.

141
I know.

142
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

143
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

144
Can we have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

145
That'd be great.

146
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.

147
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

148
No, honey, really. It's fine.

149
Just go with Susan.

150
Really, I think...

151
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

152
Okay. Okay. Bye.

153
- What are they doing?
- I don't know. Something girly.

154
Hey, you're early.

155
What are you doing with the lamp?

156
Just taking it to get rewired.

157
Don't take it where you took the
stereo. They've had that over a week.

158
No, no. Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

159
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

160
- You don't play the oboe.
- I could play the oboe.

161
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

162
Who are you?

163
- I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.
- I'm Chandler's new roommate.

164
- I don't think so.
- I could be Chandler's new roommate.

165
- But he told me over the phone...
- He told me in person.

166
That's weird.

167
I'm going to, uh, go into
my new apartment now.

168
Huh?

169
Hi again.

170
Hey.

171
Thank you so much.

172
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that never showed up.

173
Okay, I gotta get to work.

174
- You want some help?
- No, thanks. I got it.

175
- No, I don't!
- Whoa! Ha, ha.

176
- You okay?
- Yeah. Phew!

177
I stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

178
It's the heat.

179
And the humidity.

180
That's...

181
...a tough combination.

182
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

183
Like you wouldn't believe.

184
Wow. This is a great place.

185
Thank you.

186
Just make yourself comfortable.

187
Gotcha.

188
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

189
I got it when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford it.

190
So if the landlord ever asks...

191
...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

192
You bet I am!

193
Okay...

194
...here's your penis!

195
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

196
You said, "You wanna come in
for some lemonade?"

197
So?

198
- Ah! Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
- Yuh-huh!

199
Cover yourself up!

200
Oh, right. Sorry.

201
God, I don't believe this!

202
Someone asks you in for lemonade
and that means they want to have sex?

203
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade...

204
...iced tea, sometimes juice.

205
Look, sorry. I just...

206
I thought you liked me.

207
I'm such a jerk.

208
It's okay.

209
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

210
Not anyone I know, but...

211
By the way, I can still see it.

212
- Pheebs?
- Huh?

213
Where's your bed?

214
It's not in the apartment?

215
Oh, no!

216
I can't believe this
is happening again.

217
- What?
- Okay, enough with the third degree!

218
I don't live here anymore.

219
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

220
I don't live here anymore.

221
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

222
Everybody knows?

223
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

224
Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep
for a month...

225
...because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

226
You could've just turned
the cushion over.

227
I would have, but I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

228
What?

229
This is what I'm talking about.

230
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

231
Well, you can spill.

232
In the sink.

233
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

234
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

235
And if I stay here,
I don't see that happening.

236
- I love you too.
- Good.

237
What?

238
What? I'm just sad.

239
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

240
So what are you watching?

241
Baywatch.

242
What's it about?

243
Lifeguards.

244
Well, it sounds kind of stup...

245
Who's she?

246
Nicole Eggert.

247
We like her.

248
Wow! Look at them run!

249
They do that a lot.

250
Hey, you want a beer?

251
- I'll get one.
- Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

252
Hello?
- Hey.

253
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

254
Help yourself.

255
You okay?

256
Phoebe moved out.

257
Right.

258
I don't understand.

259
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

260
No...

261
You don't have a boyfriend because...

262
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

263
You should have a boyfriend.

264
I think so.

265
Come here.

266
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

267
...and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

268
Hi.

269
Where is everybody?

270
Ugh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

271
I think my marriage...

272
...is kind of over.

273
Oh, no! Why?

274
Because Carol's a lesbian.

275
And I'm not one.

276
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

277
Oh, my God!

278
I don't believe it!

279
Oh, you poor bunny.

280
I'm an idiot.

281
I mean, I should have seen it.

282
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

283
...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"

284
And I'd think:

285
"God, my wife is cool. " Heh.

286
Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person
is her lover?

287
Well, now I do!

288
I'm sorry.

289
Seven years!

290
I mean, we've been together
seven years.

291
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

292
She's the only woman I've ever...

293
Oh, Ross.

294
Mm. This is nice.

295
I know. It is, isn't it?

296
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

297
Is it 100 percent cotton?

298
Yeah...

299
...and I got it on sale too.

300
I should go.

301
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

302
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

303
That sounds great.

304
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...

305
I know.

306
Thanks.

307
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing...

308
...or I'd paid more attention...

309
...or I had a uterus.

310
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

311
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.

312
- You're so good.
- Thanks.

313
And you're so sweet.

314
- Thanks.
- And you're kind.

315
Thanks.

316
Come here.

317
Wait, wait, wait.

318
It's okay.

319
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

320
- What?
- I can't get it out.

321
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

322
Come on, don't start.

323
- Ow!
- What?

324
Stupid balls are in the way.

325
Oh, well.

326
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

327
You have chalk on your face.

328
Ugh. You're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

329
Honey, you okay?

330
My wife's a lesbian.

331
Cool!

332
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

333
I can't believe you came back.

334
Don't say anything.

335
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

336
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here...

337
...right now.

338
It's the time of the season

339
When love runs high

340
KIKl:
Rachel!

341
Rachel!

342
- What?
- You missed the exit.

343
Oh! Sorry.

344
My God, what were you thinking about?

345
Ahem, um...

346
Barry.

347
Aw.

1
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are...

2
...nobody is allowed
to climb on the dinosaur.

3
But of course,
this went right in one ear...

4
I love how he cares so much
about stuff.

5
If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.

6
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

7
When are those gonna become extinct?

8
If I was a superhero
who could fly and be invisible...

9
...that would be the best.

10
What does Rachel see in this guy?

11
I love Rachel.

12
I wish she was my wife.

13
Who's singing?

14
Hey, when you guys were kids
and you played Happy Days...

15
...who were you? I was always Richie.
- I was always Joanie.

16
Question: Was, uh, "Egg the Gellers"
the war cry of your neighborhood?

17
Ew, ew! It's the Mattress King.

18
- Don't look. Change the channel.
Boo!

19
Wait. I want to see this.
After I divorce him...

20
...half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.

21
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

22
My kingdom is suddenly
without a queen.

23
I'm so depressed...

24
...I'm going to slash...

25
...my prices! Check it out!

26
599 for a California king.
499 for a pillow-top queen set.

27
I'm going medieval on prices.

28
What a wank.

29
Oh, I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses.

30
I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen,
who cares about the divorce?

31
Those babies will sell themselves.

32
And I'm appalled for you, by the way.

33
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.

34
Okay. Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

35
- "We"?
- Ahem.

36
- Are, uh, having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

37
Oh, shoot. Tomorrow's not good.

38
I'm supposed to, um, fall off
the Empire State Building...

39
...and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so...

40
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.

41
Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head. "

42
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

43
Okay, look, I know. Just one dinner.
Please, one night. For me. Please?

44
I just want him to love you like I do.

45
All right. Well, not exactly like I do.

46
But if you do come to dinner...

47
...I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

48
I'll go.

49
- Fine.
- Thank you.

50
Hi, Gunther.

51
Yeah. We'll see.

52
- Hey, you guys.
Hey.

53
Hey. Hey.
- Guess what.

54
- I got a gig.
- Great.

55
See, that's why I can never be an actor.
Because I can't say "gig. "

56
Yeah, I can't say "croissant. "
Oh, my God.

57
- What's the part?
- It's not a part. No.

58
I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

59
Come on. That's great.

60
It's like my chance
to give something back...

61
...to the acting community.

62
You know, you're probably not allowed
to sleep with any of your students.

63
I know.

64
Ugh. I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

65
I mean, if you buy a bed
from Janice's ex-husband...

66
...that's like betraying Chandler.

67
Not at these prices.

68
Hi.

69
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

70
Whoosh.

71
Oh, oh, oh.

72
Phoebe, come here.

73
Ah, this is my new bed.

74
You gotta feel this bad boy.

75
Ugh. Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

76
Chandler's your friend. Oh.

77
Oh, my God.

78
Oh. All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends. Oh.

79
Good evening.

80
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

81
And I will be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

82
Now, um...

83
...on my first day as Dr. Drake
Ramoray on Days of our Lives...

84
...uh, ahem, I learned that
one of the most important things...

85
...in soap opera acting is reacting.

86
This does not mean acting again.

87
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

88
And it goes something like this. Ahem.

89
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

90
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas...

91
...some of you are gonna have to become
much more attractive.

92
All right, moving right along...

93
- Hi.
- Hey.

94
- Oh! How was teaching last night?
- Oh, it was great. You get to say stuff like:

95
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you. "

96
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

97
Oh, and guess what.
I got an audition for All My Children.

98
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah, it's this great part.

99
This boxer named Nick.

100
And I'm so, so right for it, you know?
He's just like me...

101
...except that he's a boxer...

102
...and has an evil twin.

103
Oh.

104
Dum-datta-dum.

105
Hear ye, hear ye.
Delivery from the Mattress King.

106
You Miss Geller?

107
- Okay.
- Sign here.

108
- Ooh. Do I have a middle name?
- Mm-hm.

109
All right. Monica Felula...

110
...Geller.

111
It's that bedroom there.

112
Hey, Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

113
Yeah. So please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

114
- You want me to lie to Chandler?
- Is that a problem?

115
No.

116
Oh, hey, hey, Nick the boxer.
Let's see what you got.

117
- Yeah.
- All right, put them up. Come on.

118
- Hey, you're pretty good at this.
- Ha, ha.

119
Yeah, I had to learn.
I was staying at the Y...

120
...and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

121
Hey, now. Hey.

122
- Ow. And I'm bleeding. Okay, great.
- Oh, oh!

123
Wow. And I'm a vegetarian.

124
All right, I'm sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

125
- Put your head back. Ooh.
- Okay. All right.

126
- I can't see.
- I have you.

127
Oh, God.

128
Which bedroom
do you want it in, Ms. Geller?

129
Oh. It's the compulsively neat one
by the window, okay?

130
Gotcha.

131
Hi, Daddy.

132
This is where they put us?

133
What? There was no table
available in the kitchen?

134
- Hello, baby.
- You remember Ross.

135
- Mm-hm.
- Nice to see you again, Dr. Green.

136
So.

137
- How's the library?
- Uh, museum.

138
- What happened to the library?
- There never was a library.

139
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just that I, um...

140
I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.

141
You know what's really good here?

142
- The lobster.
- Mm.

143
- What do you say? Shall I just order three?
- Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.

144
It was a joke. I made a joke.

145
Yeah, actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

146
What kind of person's
allergic to lobster?

147
I guess the kind of person
that works in a library. Ha, ha.

148
- It's not...
- I know. It's a museum.

149
What, you're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

150
Uh, waiter.

151
We will have two lobsters and a menu.

152
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?

153
They found rust.

154
- Do you know what rust does to a boat?
- Gives it a nice antique-y look?

155
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

156
Wow, I'm sorry.

157
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Ha, ha.

158
Excuse me for a moment,
will you, please?

159
I wanna say good night
to the Levines before we go.

160
Okay.

161
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

162
Yeah. Oh.

163
Uh-oh. I think your dad
must have added wrong.

164
He only tipped, like, 4 percent.

165
Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.

166
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You're a waitress.

167
Yes, it bothers me, Ross.

168
But, you know, if he was a regular
at the coffee house...

169
...I'd be serving him sneezers.

170
- So?
- So, Ross...

171
...I've bugged him about this
a million times. He's not gonna change.

172
Do you really serve people sneezers?

173
Ahem, well, um, I don't.

174
- All right, kids. Ready?
- Yes.

175
- Thanks again, Dr. Green.
- Uh-huh.

176
Wait, wait, wait,
I think I forgot my receipt.

177
- Oh, you don't need that.
- Ahem, why not?

178
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes...

179
...the, uh, night blindness.

180
What is this?

181
Who put a 20 down here?

182
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah, that would be me.

183
Um, I have... I have a problem.

184
I tip way too much, way, way too much.

185
- It's a sickness, really.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

186
- We have to do something about that.
- Excuse me.

187
You think I'm cheap?

188
- He didn't mean anything by that.
- Huh?

189
- He really didn't.
- Nothing I do means anything. Really.

190
This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.

191
You put down 20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big-Shot.

192
- You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot?
- Oh.

193
Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the
whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?

194
Well, "Mr. Big-Shot"
is better than "Wet-Head. "

195
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

196
Now, I've never been able to cry
as an actor...

197
...so if I'm in a scene
where I have to cry...

198
...I cut a hole in my pocket...

199
...take a pair of tweezers...

200
...and just start pulling.

201
Okay. Or uh...
Or let's say I want to convey...

202
...that I've, uh,
just done something evil.

203
Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.

204
No? Okay.
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

205
Well, all I do there
is try and divide 232 by 13.

206
And that's how it's done.

207
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

208
Class dismissed.

209
- Hey, Mr. Trib.
- Hey.

210
Guess what. I got an audition.

211
Oh. One of my students got an audition.
I'm so proud.

212
I was wondering if you would consider
coaching me for it.

213
- Oh, you bet. What's the part?
- Oh, it's great.

214
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.

215
Had to do it, didn't you?
You couldn't leave it alone.

216
Four percent, okay? I tip more than that
when there's a bug in my food.

217
Ross, tonight was about the two of you
getting along.

218
Ugh.

219
Would you see
my chiropractor already?

220
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

221
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

222
I'm... I'm freaking out.

223
Monica kind of trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have.

224
All right, I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

225
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her bedroom?

226
- Ahem. Yeah.
- I am so dead.

227
All right, look,
here's the bottom line, Ross.

228
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

229
So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow
and you can make nice.

230
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

231
Okay. Look,
I realize my father is difficult...

232
...but that's why you have got to be
the bigger man here.

233
Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

234
I could be a big, huge, giant man
and it still wouldn't make a difference.

235
Except that I could pick your father up
and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor. "

236
Okay, well, can't you just try it
one more time, Ross? For me? For me?

237
Rachel, one brunch
is not gonna solve anything.

238
You've gotta face it.
We're never gonna get along.

239
Okay, well, you are just going to have to.

240
Okay? I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

241
I don't want to have
a separate room for you too.

242
Okay, okay. Okay.

243
I'll get the bagels.

244
What's this?

245
Isn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom.

246
This is not the bed I ordered.

247
I know. You must have won,
like, a contest or something.

248
Phoebe.

249
Why is this car in my bedroom?

250
I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't looking...

251
...and the store said that they won't
take it back because you signed for it.

252
- When did I sign for it?
- When I was you.

253
You know what? It's all Joey's fault
because he left his nose open.

254
Did you make brownies today?

255
Knock, knock.

256
Quick. Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

257
Hey, I'm going for sushi.
Does anybody want, uh...?

258
Whoa. Somebody missed the off-ramp.

259
It's Monica's bed. What?

260
Okay...

261
It's a race car.

262
So? This has always been Monica's bed.
What, you're just noticing now?

263
How self-involved are you?

264
Okay, well, if this bed isn't new...

265
...then how come there's plastic
on the mattress?

266
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

267
Look...

268
...I just saw my best friend's brain
smeared across the canvas.

269
It's not gonna be me.

270
Not me.

271
Wow.

272
That was good. That was...

273
- Tweezers?
- No.

274
Oh, wow.

275
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

276
Any suggestions?

277
Hmm, I...

278
You told him to play the boxer gay?

279
Well, I might have said "super-gay. "

280
You totally screwed him over.

281
Joey, you're this guy's teacher.
I mean, how could you do this?

282
Because, Monica, the guy's so good.

283
And I really, really want this part.

284
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

285
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

286
- Ross?
- Dr. Green, how are you?

287
Thanks for dinner last night.

288
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

289
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

290
Okay, that's it. I can't take it anymore.

291
What, what? He's interested in you.

292
- He just wants to know how you got here.
- Oh, please.

293
- Sweetie, it's hopeless. I'm just gonna go.
- What? Ross.

294
- I'm sorry. It's just...
Ross?

295
What's with the neck?

296
He's got this thing and I keep
telling him to go to my chiropractor.

297
You still going to that chiropractor?

298
That man couldn't get into med school
in Ixtapa.

299
Yeah, thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

300
Excuse me, ahem, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

301
Wait a minute. His name is Dr. Bobby?

302
- Well, that's his last name.
- And his first name.

303
He's Bobby Bobby?

304
Ahem. It's Robert Bobby.

305
Oh.

306
And, um, excuse me. He helps me.

307
- Oh. Please. Ask her how?
- What do you need help for?

308
With my alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

309
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Argue with that.

310
What? It's true.
My right leg is two inches shorter.

311
Come on, you're just tilting.

312
- Her legs are fine.
- I know that.

313
- So why do you let her go to a chiropractor?
- I'm sorry, "Let her"?

314
What can I do? She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance, either.

315
Wait a minute.
You don't have renter's insurance?

316
- No. Ahem.
- So, what if somebody steals something?

317
How you gonna run after him
with one leg shorter than the other?

318
Hey, would you, uh...?
Would you like some juice?

319
- I'd love some juice.
- Okay.

320
Well, this is going so well.
Did you see us? Did you see?

321
Yeah, honey. I was standing right there.

322
Why don't you tell him about the mole
I haven't gotten checked?

323
Excellent.

324
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

325
...when you'll have a chance to screw over
another soap opera actor.

326
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

327
And I'm ashamed to say...

328
...that I took it.

329
I advised a fellow actor to play a role...

330
...homosexually.

331
Yeah.

332
We both auditioned for the part and, uh...

333
...as it turned out...

334
...they...

335
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

336
And now...

337
...he's got a two-year contract...

338
...opposite Susan Lucci...

339
...the first lady of daytime television.

340
And me?

341
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

342
...most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

343
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
Thank you.

345
- Uh, may I help you?
- Yes, hi.

346
I'm the lady who got stuck
with the race-car bed.

347
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

348
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller. "

349
All right, jester man, look,
we wanna see the king.

350
Nobody sees the king.

351
Okay. I'm talking to the king.

352
Hey, you can't go back there.

353
Oh, my God.

354
Hey, watch it, lady.

355
Hey, good-looking.

356
All right, I'll leave.

357
My bed's so boring.

1
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
Who wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
I'll have one.

4
Agh! Ugh.

5
- That's okay.
- I'm not having one.

6
No, no. It's just my tooth.

7
- All right.
- I'll have one.

8
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.

9
Thanks. I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.

10
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

11
Why can't you go to him?

12
Because every time I go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist...

14
...I look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
Phoebe, what, um?

16
What?

17
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
And then there was, um,
John, my mailman.

19
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

20
Ahem. And all these people actually died?

21
Yes. While I was in the chair.

22
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.

23
I floss to save lives.

24
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

26
It's just a coincidence.

27
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

28
Thanks, Gunther.

29
- Hi.
- Hey.

30
Um, can I get a napkin too?

31
Oh, like you don't already
have everything.

32
Ow!

33
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist? Just go.

34
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

35
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

36
I promise.

37
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.

38
Hey, is Chandler here?

39
No. No, he's not.

40
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

41
- Huh? Oh!
What?

42
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

43
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be...

44
...to not.

45
Joey, if you know about this,
you have to tell him.

46
It'll kill him. It'll just kill him.

47
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.

48
Ew!

49
Ugly Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

50
I'm going to the dentist. So listen...

51
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

52
...or that can fall on you...

53
...or...

54
All right, just look out!

55
Okay? And, um, I also just want to...

56
I just want to tell you all that, um...

57
I have a problem. I have to go
into work for a few hours.

58
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

59
What did they do?

60
They painted over the word
"sapien," for one thing.

61
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

62
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

63
Yes, that's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.

64
Woah, wait, hello! Heh, what about me?

65
You. You want to watch Ben?

66
That would be great!
I just asked Monica...

67
...because I know how empty her life is.

68
- Hey, Ross? I got a science question.
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

69
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,
"homo" sapiens...

70
...is that why they're extinct?

71
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

72
Hey, I'm not judging.

73
Look, Benny! Spoon!

74
Spoon!

75
Come on. All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.

76
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

77
You wanna show Rachel? Come here.

78
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

79
Whee!

80
Whee! Ha, ha, oh!

81
You're so brave.
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

82
- You're so brave.
- You're okay.

83
He's fine. Let's just put him down.

84
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

85
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

86
Nothing, because we're not telling him.

87
- We're not?
- No.

88
- All right, I like that.
- Okay.

89
So we're okay. We're okay, aren't we?

90
No, we're not okay. There's a bump.

91
- There's a bump.
- What bump?

92
Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in!

93
I can not push it in!

94
- Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
- Okay.

95
- That's it.
- Okay.

96
- I got it!
- Okay.

97
- The second Ross walks in...
- Yeah.

98
...take him to your bedroom and do
whatever you do that makes him go:

99
Or...

100
...we could put a hat on his head.

101
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

102
Oh, oh, oh! I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

103
Because he'll know what to do?

104
Oh, my God. You're a genius!

105
Oh, God. It's kind of sewn on.

106
- Give it. Give it.
- Okay.

107
- Oh!
- Oh.

108
Agh, it's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

109
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

110
Do you think these pearls are nice?

111
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

112
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.

113
- Come in here with me.
- Woah, woah, whoa, wait. Woah.

114
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

115
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

116
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. "

117
I'd like to get her something serious.

118
Oh, you want something serious.

119
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those, um...

120
...barium enemas.

121
Those are dead serious.

122
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

123
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

124
You just can't, you can't, you can't!

125
Why not?

126
Oh, God. Uh, okay.

127
Here's the thing. Ahem.

128
This is the thing. Okay, the thing is...

129
- What is the thing?
- Okay.

130
I went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

131
...and I saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

132
What?

133
They were in his office.

134
Well, she... She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

135
I'm telling you, I saw it.

136
Well, you're wrong. Okay? You're wrong.

137
I'm not wrong.

138
I wish I was.

139
I'm sorry.

140
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now, huh?

141
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.

142
Oh! You're alive! You're alive!

143
See? I promised you
no one would die, didn't I?

144
We'll see about that. Can I use your
phone to call everyone I know?

145
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

146
Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.

147
Monica.

148
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

149
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

150
Monica bang!

151
Ahem. Okay, I heard that.

152
- Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
- Mm-hm.

153
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

154
- Monica bang!
- Oh, ho, ho.

155
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

156
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.

157
You see? We all do it all the time.

158
See? Watch this.

159
Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow.

160
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

161
Ben bang!

162
Rachel bang!

163
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

164
- Oh, isn't it fun?
- Look at that! Look at that!

165
We all do it!

166
- Okay, I'm stopping now.
- Are you okay?

167
Oh, yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

168
How's my Bing-a-ling?

169
Uh...

170
I don't know.

171
You tell me.

172
Anything you, uh, want to tell me?

173
Because if you, uh... You should...

174
You would tell me.

175
Why are your eyes so wide?

176
You tell me.

177
Maybe it's because I was just
fooling around with my ex.

178
Oh, no. No, no, no. That was you!

179
Oh, my God!

180
- All right!
- How did you know?

181
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

182
In the park?

183
No. In his office.
How many kisses were there?

184
- Just those two!
- Wh...? Why? Why?

185
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

186
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so, so...

187
I'm so, so sorry. I just...

188
What happened was I...
I can't breathe.

189
Can you get me a bag or something?
Aah.

190
- Here. Here.
- Aah.

191
There.

192
- It's the receipt.
- I'll take it.

193
Look, I've got to know.

194
Are you finished with me?

195
Are you finished with him?

196
Do you still love him?

197
Do you still love me?

198
All right, look...

199
...I'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

200
So which is it?

201
Him or me?

202
I don't know.

203
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

204
Ben, I won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

205
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

206
Number one, I don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

207
And number two, I...

208
What?

209
You said "number two. "

210
I also said "number one. "

211
Ha-ha-ha, I know.

212
- Hey, everyone!
- Hi!

213
How's my little boy?

214
He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?

215
- He's never been better.
- What did you do, take him whaling?

216
Monica.

217
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

218
Monica bang!

219
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.

220
That's what I'd sound like
if I exploded.

221
Woo-hoo! The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know...

222
...and everyone is alive!

223
- Huh.
What?

224
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

225
Oh, my God, I killed another one!

226
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

227
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

228
I'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

229
We should call somebody.

230
Tell them the naked guy we stare at
isn't moving?

231
We've got to find out if he's alive.

232
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

233
Well, there is one way.

234
His window's open. I say...

235
...we poke him.

236
Hey!

237
You know how we, uh,
save all those chopsticks...

238
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

239
Yeah?

240
Well, now we got a reason.

241
What?

242
Well, we're fashioning a very long
poking device.

243
All right.

244
Hey, uh, what's the matter?

245
I talked to Janice.

246
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

247
She doesn't know.

248
Says she loves us both.

249
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

250
I was happy!

251
It serves me right for buying
that 12-pack of condoms.

252
And now I can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

253
What are you, uh...?
What are you gonna do?

254
I don't know.

255
You know? What would you do?

256
Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.

257
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

258
All right, you, uh...

259
...you probably won't want
to hear this, but, uh...

260
...if it was me,
and this is just me, I would, uh...

261
- I would bow out.
- What?

262
What are you talking about?

263
They have a kid together...

264
...you know? They're like...

265
They're, like, a family.

266
And if, I don't know...

267
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

268
...I wouldn't want to be the guy
who stood in the way.

269
You okay?

270
You, uh?

271
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

272
- Well, he's finally asleep.
- Mm.

273
About that, uh, bump on his head...

274
Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?

275
No offense, but I've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

276
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

277
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.

278
- I did!
- I know.

279
You just have to watch them
all the time.

280
I did! I watched! I watched!

281
I watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

282
Monica did it?

283
- Monica? Um...
- Yeah.

284
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

285
No, why?

286
I was just playing with him, and we
were doing the "Alphabet Song"...

287
...which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F."

288
It's like they just, uh, I don't know,
fell out of his head.

289
Really?

290
Oh, and also, he's walking...

291
...kind of funny.

292
It's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

293
Yeah, he's in there,
just sort of, you know...

294
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

295
I hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

296
You jerk!

297
You know I love that kid!
Monica bang! Monica bang!

298
Ow.

299
I'll get the hat.

300
I have something to tell you.

301
And I want you to let me
get through it...

302
...because...

303
...it's not gonna be easy.

304
Okay.

305
I think you should go back with Gary.

306
I don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

307
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

308
Whenever I'd see him,
I'd always think:

309
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together. "

310
And I hated that guy.

311
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

312
Wow!

313
Yeah, wow.

314
- It's the right thing to do.
- Ugh.

315
You're right.

316
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye...

317
...there's something I really
need you to know.

318
The way I feel about you...

319
...it's like I finally understand...

320
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

321
You know? I mean, what we have...

322
...it's like movie love.

323
You're my soul mate.

324
I can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

325
Then don't leave me.

326
What?

327
Forget what I said! I was babbling!
Pick me!

328
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.

329
Pssh! No, you don't!

330
No, I say you have to give your divorce
another chance!

331
I'm sorry.

332
Oh, don't go.

333
No, I gotta go.

334
No. No. No, no.

335
Honey. Honey. Ha, ha.

336
- People are looking.
- I don't care.

337
I don't care!

338
Yeah, um, okay. I'm...

339
I'm leaving now.

340
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

341
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

342
Rachel has those in burgundy.

343
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

344
Fortunately,
I have experience in that area.

345
Can we please focus here?
A naked man's life hangs in the balance.

346
I'm telling you, he's dead.

347
What we're about to have here
is a dead fat guy on a stick!

348
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

349
Steady.

350
Okay, a little higher.

351
Careful of the angle.

352
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

353
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

354
He's alive! He's alive!

355
And yet we're still poking him.

356
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

357
- He does not look happy.
- Hey, hey.

358
Now he's showing us his poking device.

359
Hey, that's never gonna make it
all the way over here, buddy! Ha.

360
I'll hold you close in my arms

361
I can't resist your charms

362
And love

363
Love

364
I'll be a fool for you

365
I'm sure

366
You know I don't mind

367
Oh, you know I don't mind

368
Yes

369
You mean the world to me

370
- Oh, I know
- I know

371
- I've found
- I've found

372
In you

373
My endless love

374
Love

375
- Lo... Love
- Love

1
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

2
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

3
We know.

4
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

5
No, you want to put them
in concentric circles.

6
I want to do this.

7
Every year.

8
To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!

9
You know, for once, I am gonna try
to watch one of these things.

10
Halftime.

11
Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?

12
- Oh, that would be so much fun!
- Can I play too?

13
I've never played football, ever.

14
Great! You can cover Chandler.

15
I don't... I don't really want to play.

16
You never do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

17
Not true.

18
I wanted to wear my bathrobe
and eat peanut clusters all day.

19
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

20
You have to start getting
over her, all right?

21
If you play, maybe it'll
take your mind off Janice.

22
If you don't, everyone will be mad at
you because the teams won't be even.

23
All right, I'll play.

24
- Yay!
- Yay! Let's do it! Ross?

25
- What?
Wanna play football?

26
Um...

27
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

28
Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.

29
Yes.

30
Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, um,
we used to have a touch football game...

31
...called The Geller Bowl.

32
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

33
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains, and, um...

34
It got kind of competitive.
And one year, Geller Bowl VI...

35
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

36
It was so not an accident.

37
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

38
...her big fat grandma-arm
elbow in my face...

39
...and just kept running.

40
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

41
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.

42
Uh, you did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

43
...because of the spectacularly illegal,
and savage, nose-breaking.

44
I won the game.

45
Yeah? Then how come you
didn't get the Geller Cup?

46
Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?

47
Yes, the trophy you got
if you won the game.

48
But Dad said nobody won,
and he was sick of our fighting.

49
So he took the trophy...

50
...threw it in the lake.

51
And was the curse lifted?

52
Anyway...

53
...Mom said we weren't
allowed to play football again.

54
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

55
I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

56
Can I see you for a second?

57
Wuss!

58
All right, we're gonna play.

59
Wait. How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.

60
Here you go.

61
All right.

62
- Let's bring it in.
Wait.

63
Honey, throw it to me!

64
- Here you go.
- Aah!

65
That almost hit me in the face!

66
We have to pick captains.

67
And then "Tennilles. "

68
So how do we decide that?

69
- Why don't we just bunny up?
What?

70
- Bunny!
- Bunny!

71
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

72
Okay, so, um, I bunnied first,
so I get to pick first. Joey.

73
- Thank you.
- Monica.

74
I'm your best friend.

75
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.

76
Chandler.

77
- Ross?
- Phoebe.

78
Sweetie, now I pick you.

79
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

80
Okay. All right. So let's see.

81
Let's play from the, uh,
trash can to the light post, right?

82
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

83
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes...

84
...before I have to baste again.

85
Wow, just like in the pros.

86
- Okay, huddle up! Whoo!
- Woo-hoo.

87
- Huddle up over here!
Wait for me! Wait for me!

88
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

89
- Okay.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

90
So what do you guys really think
of Chandler?

91
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

92
Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.

93
What's "block"?

94
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life!

95
Break!

96
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

97
Ow! Son of a...! Ow!

98
- Come on!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

99
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

100
I got it!

101
Go, go, go!

102
Score! Seven to nothing!

103
Honey, you okay?

104
Come on, let's go.

105
Whoo. Losers walk.

106
Yeah? Losers talk.

107
No, no, actually, losers rhyme.

108
Forty-three...

109
...74...

110
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.

111
Hike.

112
One Mississippi...
Over here! Over here! Unh.

113
Ha! I almost caught that one!

114
Great. Now the score's
seven to almost seven.

115
Okay, on this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

116
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?

117
You?

118
You go long.

119
How long?

120
Until we start to look very small.

121
- Okay. Break!
- Break!

122
Set, hike!
One Mississippi...

123
Switch! Switch! Switch!

124
No, no, no, no!

125
Huhh...

126
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

127
You are playing American football?

128
Yeah.

129
Wow, you're, like,
from a whole other country!

130
- I'm Dutch.
- Hi, I'm Joey.

131
I am Margha.

132
- Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
- Ha-ha-ha.

133
You wanna play football or...?
Hi, I'm Chandler.

134
Hello, Chandler.

135
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham. "

136
- Margha.
- Margha.

137
Margha.

138
Mahan.

139
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Second down!

140
- Uh, hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.

141
- Wow.
- "Wow" what?

142
It just amazes me that you're
still pulling stuff like this. Heh.

143
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.

144
Take all the second downs you need.

145
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.

146
It is okay if I stay and watch?

147
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?

148
- That went well.
- I think so.

149
I was thinking about, uh,
asking her for her number.

150
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself.

151
I was thinking about for me, as part
of that getting-over-Janice thing.

152
Oh, yeah. That.

153
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

154
Thanks.

155
Wh...? "Let me have her"?

156
You mean if you didn't,
I wouldn't have a shot?

157
I don't like to say it out loud...

158
...but yeah!

159
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.

160
Math? You're giving me math?

161
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

162
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

163
I want you to run a post-pattern
to the left. And, sweetie...

164
Yeah, I know. Go long.

165
All I'm doing is running
back and forth from the huddle.

166
Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?

167
- Can I see that for a second?
- Yeah.

168
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

169
I got Chandler
- Hike!

170
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

171
Fumble!

172
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

173
Well, now you have two.

174
Hey, I am good at math!

175
That's it.
I was still gonna let you have her.

176
But now,
prepare to feel bad about yourself.

177
I've been preparing for that
my entire life!

178
Or something about you that's mean!

179
Come on, guys. Let's go.

180
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

181
Forty-two, 38, hike!

182
I got it! Ooh! Ugh!

183
Broken boobs! Ow.

184
Pheebs, run!
Run, Phoebe! Run!

185
- God! Touchdown! Touchdown!
Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!

186
No, no, no.

187
Uh, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

188
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.

189
- After.
- Before.

190
- Does it really matter?
Yes!

191
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

192
Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.

193
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

194
Oh, my God!

195
That's fine. Maybe you haven't
grown up, but I have.

196
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!

197
Ugh, oh! Oh.

198
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead.

199
The touchdown does count. You win.

200
- Whoo! Yay!
- No!

201
I won't do this again. I wanna
beat you when you can't blame it...

202
...on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

203
Let's just call this tie score
and it's halftime.

204
First, I don't play with cheaters.

205
Second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

206
You know what? I think you'll play.

207
Oh, really? Why's that?

208
Because the winner gets this.

209
The Geller Cup!

210
Is everybody else seeing
a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

211
Mm-hm.

212
Okay, good.

213
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

214
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

215
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

216
That cup is mine!

217
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

218
So are we not having dinner at all?

219
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

220
Keep your head in the game.

221
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

222
If I take Chandler out of the running,
will you be able to focus?

223
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.

224
I'll do the rest.

225
Come on, you wuss!
Okay, come on.

226
Go, Cha... Chandler.
- I got it!

227
Come on! This way! Come on!

228
Look out!
- Oof!

229
Whoa, whoa.

230
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.

231
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the tackling?

232
What?

233
I just touched him and he went over.

234
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

235
Let's get ready to rumble!

236
Aah!

237
Go, go, go!
Get her! Get her!

238
I love this game!

239
Where'd you get that?

240
I went really long.

241
Forty-two to 21.

242
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

243
You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

244
Pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

245
...because I'm better than you?

246
- Pfft!
- Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

247
All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?

248
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

249
What? The guys against the girls?

250
That's ridiculous because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

251
Oh, then bring it on!

252
Unless you're afraid you might lose
to a bunch of girls.

253
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

254
I can not believe you're trading me.

255
Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

256
You're gonna let me play?

257
All right, then!

258
The game is over? We eat now?

259
No, the game's not over.
We're switching teams.

260
Chandler finds me so intimidating that
it's better if we're on the same team.

261
Okay, let's play. Let's go.

262
Oh, uh, hold on a second.

263
Ahem.
Where do Dutch people come from?

264
Uh, well, the, uh...

265
...Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

266
And the, uh, other Dutch people?

267
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

268
Nice try.

269
The Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

270
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

271
Oh, my.

272
Enough "geography for the insane. "
Let's play ball.

273
No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.

274
- Oh, fine with me.
- I've had enough of this.

275
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

276
What are you doing?

277
What are you doing?
- Shh, shh.

278
Which do I like?

279
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

280
Well, if I had to choose right now...

281
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

282
...I would have to say Chandler.

283
Yes!

284
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.

285
Why don't you have Captain Hook
explain it to her?

286
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

287
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

288
I win! You suck! I rule all!

289
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

290
Woo-hoo!

291
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to "no one. "

292
What?

293
I now find you shallow, and, um...

294
...a dork.

295
Bye-bye.

296
Heh. Nice going.

297
You just saved yourself
a couple months of sex.

298
It doesn't matter,
because she picked me.

299
From now on, I get the dates...

300
...and you stay home on Saturday nights
watching Ready, Set, Cook!

301
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

302
We have no time,
and we are losing to girls.

303
We're not gonna lose to girls.

304
It's 42-21!

305
This sucks! I was just up by that much!

306
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

307
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.

308
Think about every lousy date
you ever had.

309
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

310
Oh, my God. You dated someone
with a glass eye too?

311
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

312
Yeah! Kill them!

313
All right, I want to kill them too.

314
But they're boys.

315
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

316
A minute and a half left,
and we're down by two points.

317
Two points, ladies.

318
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

319
Rachel, you go long.

320
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

321
Honey, there's a reason.

322
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.

323
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.

324
Let her throw the ball.

325
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

326
Thank you.

327
- Break!
- Break!

328
All right, here we go.

329
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

330
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi!

331
Go, go, go!

332
- Catch it!
- Ow!

333
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

334
They were coming at me,
and I didn't know what to do.

335
- Thirty seconds left on the timer.
Woo-hoo.

336
So we get to take that, uh,
stupid troll thing home.

337
Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

338
- Huddle up!
Okay.

339
Oh! This is our last huddle!

340
All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...

341
...go long.
- Okay.

342
Break!

343
Ahh! I did it! Touchdown! We did it!

344
You know? Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

345
So you're five feet short. So...

346
...ha-ha-ha, we win!
- Whoo!

347
Yes, yes, yes!

348
Wait, explain something, though.

349
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

350
Let me in! Let me in!
No way! Let go!

351
Let go? I'm a tiny little woman!

352
Guys, come on, it's Thanksgiving!

353
It's not important who wins or loses.

354
The important thing
is the Dutch girl picked me!

355
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

356
Ow!

357
We should play football
more often.

358
Maybe there's a league
we could join.

359
Isn't there a "national football league"?

360
Yes, there is. They play on
Sundays and Monday nights.

361
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

362
Aww.

363
This stuffing is amazing.
Do you think we should bring them some?

364
When they're hungry, they'll come in.

365
Let go!
No, you let go!

366
How come it's always us
left holding the ball?

367
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

368
Hey, it's starting to snow.

369
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on, let go!

﻿1
Okay, so we went to the beach because
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
...who knew her mom and dad...

3
...and I don't really know
what happened with that.

4
- I'm your mother.
- Huh?

5
Monica joked that she wouldn't
go out with a guy like Chandler.

6
- Hi there.
- He couldn't let it go.

7
I don't really know what happened with that.
And then Ross' new girlfriend shows up...

8
...and Rachel convinced her
to shave her head.

9
And then Ross and Rachel kiss.

10
And now Ross has to choose
between Rachel and the bald girl.

11
And I don't know what happened
there either.

12
You know what? Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

13
Hi.

14
- Hi.
- Hey.

15
Rachel was just helping me out.
My head got all sunburned.

16
Aw.

17
- Thanks a million.
- Oh, you're welcome a million.

18
- Okay, I'll be in our room.
- Uh.

19
Oh, my God.

20
I know.

21
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Whoa. What? Why?

22
Uh, I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

23
Here? Now?

24
Well, yeah, I can't stay here all night.

25
And if I go in there,
she's gonna want to...

26
...do stuff.

27
Can't you just tell here
that you are not in the mood?

28
No, she likes that.

29
Ha, ha. Yeah, faking sleep
doesn't work either.

30
I can't tell you how many mornings
I woke up with her...

31
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

32
- Ha, ha. Yeah, why am I telling you?
- I don't know. Ha, ha.

33
Uh, uh...

34
- It wasn't every morning...
- Oh, making it worse.

35
Okay.

36
So I guess you'd like to know
how it all happened.

37
I mean, well, I think I can figure it out.

38
I guess, you know, I was born...

39
...and then everyone
started lying their asses off.

40
No, no, it wasn't like that.

41
I mean, remember how I told you
how Lily and Frank and I, we were close?

42
Well, we were very close.

43
How close?

44
Well, the three of us,
we were kind of a, um... A couple.

45
- I don't even know how that would work.
- Well, we...

46
I'm not asking.

47
Well, anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

48
...and I was...

49
...scared. I was stupid and selfish and...

50
I was 18 years old.

51
I mean, you remember what it was like
to be 18 years old, don't you?

52
Yeah. Let's see, my mom had killed herself
and my dad had run off.

53
And I was living in a gremlin with a guy
named Cindy, who talked to his hand.

54
Oh, I'm so sorry.

55
I thought I was leaving you
with the best parents in the world.

56
I didn't even hear about your mom and dad
till a couple of years ago.

57
And by then, you were already grown-up.

58
I don't know. You're here
and I would really...

59
I would like to get to know you.

60
Yeah, well, everybody does. Ha, ha.

61
I'm a really cool person.

62
And you know, you had 29 years
to find that out...

63
...but you didn't even try.

64
You know what? You walked out on me,
and I'm gonna do the same to you.

65
- Wait.
- Okay? I don't ever want to see you again.

66
Where's my purse?

67
Shoot. We're out of soda.

68
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.

69
- Really?
- No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

70
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

71
Huh. Well, ahem...

72
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

73
I found a dried-up seahorse.

74
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

75
Oh, my new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

76
Oh, wait, Pheebs.

77
Wait a second. Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

78
No. I just... I wanna...

79
I need to be alone.

80
- Monica.
- Oh.

81
It's over.

82
- Oh. Was it awful?
- Well, it was long.

83
I didn't even realize how late it was...

84
...till I noticed the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

85
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

86
I wrote you a letter.

87
Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.

88
I like mail.

89
There's just some things
I've been thinking about.

90
You know, things about us.

91
And before we can even think
about the two of us getting back together...

92
...I just need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

93
- Okay. Heh.
- Okay.

94
Well, it's...

95
It's 5:30 in the morning. Heh.

96
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.

97
So I'll be waiting for you.
Just come up when you're done.

98
Okay. I'll be up...

99
...in 18 pages.

100
Front and back.

101
Very exciting.

102
Oh, oh.

103
Hey.

104
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

105
Done.

106
- You just finished?
- Well, I wanted to be thorough.

107
I mean, this is clearly
very, very important to you. To us.

108
And so I wanted to read
every word carefully.

109
Twice.

110
So, um...

111
Does it?

112
I'm sorry?

113
Does it?

114
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part just another glance.

115
What are you talking about, Ross?
You just said that you read it twice.

116
Look, you know what? It either does
or doesn't. And if you have to think...

117
No, Rach.
No, I don't have to think about it. I don't.

118
Uh, in fact...

119
...I've decided. I have decided...

120
...that it...

121
...does.

122
- Are you sure?
- Oh, sure, I'm sure.

123
All right. There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

124
Would you go out with me?

125
Ehh.

126
I've got canned goods.

127
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.

128
Check this baby out. Dug me a hole.

129
Excellent hole, Joe.

130
Oh, no, no. My hole.

131
Ow! My foot. Ow!

132
What? What is it?

133
Jellyfish sting.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

134
Well, can we help you,
take you back to the house?

135
Oh, it's, like, two miles.

136
Yeah, and I'm a little tired
from digging the hole.

137
Damn the jellyfish.

138
Damn all the jellyfish.

139
We've gotta do something.

140
There's only one thing you can do.

141
What? What is it?

142
You're gonna have to pee on it.

143
What? Gross.

144
Don't blame me.
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

145
You know what? He's right.
There's something like ammonia in that...

146
...that kills the pain.

147
Well, forget it. It doesn't hurt that bad!

148
If you want some privacy,
you can use my hole.

149
Well, I'm ready
to get the hell out of here.

150
Oh.

151
Are you...?

152
Are you?

153
Oh, that's so great.

154
Ooh, not for Bonnie.

155
But for you, yay, aah.

156
- Hey.
- How was the beach?

157
- Nothing. I don't know.
- Uh, let's not worry about it.

158
- What happened?
- Nothing.

159
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Me too.

160
Me too.

161
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.

162
Oh, I have to go pack. Oh!

163
- And it really does?
- It does.

164
It really and truly does.

165
Oh.

166
It so does not.

167
She wants me to take responsibility...

168
...for everything that went wrong
in our relationship.

169
I mean, she goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

170
We were on a break!

171
Oh, my God. If you say that one more time,
I'm gonna break up with you.

172
All right, fine.

173
But this breakup was not all my fault.
And she says here:

174
"If you accept full responsibility..."
Full responsibility.

175
"...I can begin to trust you again.

176
Does that seem like something
you can do? Does it?"

177
No?

178
Look, Ross, you have what you want.
You're back with Rachel.

179
You're gonna wreck the best thing
that ever happened to you.

180
Yeah, I know. I know, you're right.

181
Yeah, I guess I'll let it go.

182
But you understand how hard it is
to forget about this?

183
Sure, it's hard to forget...

184
...but that doesn't mean
you have to talk about it.

185
A lot of things happened on that trip...

186
...that we should never, ever talk about.

187
What the hell happened on that beach?

188
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

189
- Hi, Ursula.
- Hey.

190
Okay, well, um, I know that
we haven't talked in a long time.

191
But, um, okay, our mom
is not our birth mom.

192
This other lady is our birth mom.

193
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montauk.
Mm-hm.

194
You know her?

195
No. I, um... I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

196
There was a suicide note?

197
Well, do you still have it?

198
Hang on.

199
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

200
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

201
I... Shut up.

202
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

203
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

204
You just wrote this.

205
Well, it's pretty much the gist.

206
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

207
No.

208
All right. Hang on.

209
Pass the cheese, please.

210
Ugh.

211
My God, you can't even look at me,
can you?

212
No.

213
Yay, it's Phoebe. We can talk to Phoebe.

214
No, I'm too depressed to talk.

215
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

216
Hey, you guys...

217
...what do you think about making
that beach trip an annual thing?

218
No.

219
All right, that's it, you guys.
What happened out there?

220
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

221
I came back with nothing all over me.

222
- Come on, what happened? Joey?
- What does that mean?

223
- All right.
- No.

224
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

225
They'll never understand.

226
But we have to say something.

227
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

228
- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
- All right.

229
All right.

230
I got stung.

231
Stung bad.

232
I couldn't stand. I...

233
I couldn't walk.

234
We were two miles from the house.

235
We were scared and alone.

236
We didn't think we could make it.

237
I was in too much pain.

238
And I was tired
from digging the huge hole.

239
And then Joey remembered something.

240
I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

241
Wait a minute, I saw that.

242
On the Discovery Channel.
Yeah, about jellyfish and how if you...

243
Ew.

244
You peed on yourself?

245
Ew.

246
You can't say that. You don't know.

247
I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

248
Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't...

249
...bend that way.

250
So...

251
Ew.

252
That's right. I stepped up.

253
She's my friend and she needed help.

254
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

255
Only, uh, I couldn't.

256
I got the stage fright.

257
I wanted to help,
but there was just too much pressure...

258
...so I, uh... I turned to Chandler.

259
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it. Do it now."

260
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

261
That's because, sometimes, I just do it
through my wall to freak you out.

262
And fuchsia and mauve

263
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

264
Thank you. Thank you.

265
Oh, and I invite all of you
to count the colors in your bedroom.

266
Except for you. You go away.

267
I'll go in a second.

268
I just want to tell you...

269
...that there hasn't been a day
when I didn't regret giving you up.

270
Okay, bye.

271
No, I'm not done.

272
I just want you to know, the reason
I never looked you up was because...

273
...well, I was afraid that you'd react...

274
...just, well, like the way
you're reacting now.

275
Can't we just, you know, start from here?
Please?

276
No.

277
Okay.

278
Sorry.

279
But just one last thing.

280
You know, you came looking for family.

281
I'm family.

282
I'm it.

283
Well, now I'm done.

284
Yeah, but it's not like
we're losing anything, you know?

285
Yeah, I guess you're right.

286
It's not like we know each other or anything
or that have anything in common.

287
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's not like
we don't have anything in common.

288
I mean, I like, uh, pizza.

289
I... I like pizza.

290
You do?

291
Wait, I like, um, the Beatles.

292
Oh, my God. So do I!

293
I knew it. Wow.

294
Wait, wait, wait. Puppies. Cute or ugly?

295
- Oh, so cute.
- Oh!

296
- Well? Ha, ha.
- You see?

297
But I'm still... I'm mad at you.

298
I know.

299
I'm mad at me too.

300
Well, um, do you want to get
something to eat?

301
Because I'm kind of hungry.

302
Hey. Me too.

303
All right, stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

304
Aw, I missed you.

305
I missed you too.

306
Oh, I was so nervous about that letter.

307
But the way you
owned up to everything...

308
...it just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

309
I suppose.

310
No. You have, Ross. You have.
You should give yourself credit.

311
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

312
Heh. She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

313
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

314
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

315
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

316
We were on a break!

317
- Coffeehouse?
- You bet.

318
And for the record, it took two people
to break up this relationship.

319
Yeah, you and that girl
from the copy place...

320
...which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

321
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

322
I didn't finish the whole letter.

323
- What?
- I fell asleep.

324
You fell asleep?

325
Yeah, it was 5:30 in the morning.

326
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

327
Front and back!

328
Oh, oh, oh. And by the way.

329
"Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E" means "you are."

330
"Y-O-U-R" means "your."

331
I can't believe I even thought
of getting back together with you.

332
We are so over.

333
Fine by me!

334
Oh, and hey, hey, hey.

335
Those spelling tips will come in handy
when you're at home on Saturday nights...

336
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

337
- Hey.
- Sorry.

338
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're
gonna miss, wishing you were with me.

339
Oh, no, no.
Don't you worry about me falling asleep.

340
I still have your letter!

341
And hey, just so you know,
it's not that common.

342
It doesn't happen to every guy
and it is a big deal!

343
I knew it!

344
Gin.

345
We were playing gin?

346
You know, if we were a couple,
we could play this game naked.

347
- Ha, ha. Would you stop?
- Okay.

348
All right.

349
Okay, all right. I think you're great.

350
I think you're sweet and you're smart...

351
...and I love you.

352
But you will always be the guy
who peed on me.

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

3
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

4
Fifteen?

5
Your personal best! Ha, ha.

6
Mm-mm. Mm.

7
Where were you?

8
On a date.

9
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

10
- Which museum?
- How'd you meet her?

11
No. Answer his.

12
We were at the back of the train.

13
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

14
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

15
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

16
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

17
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

18
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

19
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

20
Done! I did it.

21
Who's stupid now?

22
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
Um, that paper is two weeks old.

24
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

25
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
I hate being alone
this time of year.

28
Next it's Valentine's Day...

29
...then my birthday, then bang!

30
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

31
I want somebody!

32
You know, I want a man!

33
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

34
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

35
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

36
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

37
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

38
Yeah.

39
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

40
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

41
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

42
Okay.

43
No accountants.

44
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

45
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

46
What's wrong, Mon?

47
Everybody at work still hates me.

48
I was making headway.

49
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

50
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

51
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

52
What's the matter?

53
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

54
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

55
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

56
Aw.

57
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

58
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

59
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

60
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

61
You know what you can do?

62
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

63
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

64
Then they would all know who was boss.

65
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

66
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

67
Good enough to get fired.

68
All right. You're hired!

69
Hey!

70
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

71
Yes.

72
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

73
I'm not asking for me.

74
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

75
I'm not gay.

76
I didn't think you were gay.

77
I do now.

78
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

79
I just got out of
a big relationship.

80
I'm not looking to get serious.

81
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

82
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel"
that you took to the Christmas Party?

83
By the way, that is her full name.

84
Wow! I'm free for her.

85
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

86
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

87
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

88
I'll bring them
by your office at 5.

89
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

90
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

91
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

92
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

93
- Yeah!
- Yes!

94
Okay.

95
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

96
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

97
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

98
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

99
- Pheebs, that's great!
- Oh, yay!

100
But you know, uh,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

101
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

102
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

103
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

104
Maypole.

105
All good. Thanks.

106
Um, do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

107
- Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
- Oh, yeah.

108
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

109
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

110
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

111
Really?

112
I showed them your picture.

113
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

114
- Knicks tonight?
- Where are the seats?

115
Wherever! I've got 20.

116
Will I like any of these guys?

117
You know, I'm going to, uh...

118
- ...play the field a little bit more.
- Chandler...

119
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

120
You work with robots?

121
Yes.

122
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

123
I like swimmers' bodies.

124
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

125
I like credit cards!

126
I'm not bad at this!

127
- What does he do?
- He works in fine foods.

128
- You have a fine foods division?
- It's a big company...

129
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

130
No, the robots just work for them.

131
All right, I'm going to work.

132
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

133
Yeah, lady. I do!

134
I got a problem!

135
I'll give you a problem!

136
What will you do?
Fire me?

137
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

138
See you later.

139
I should go.
I've got a date.

140
With who?

141
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

142
Not her.

143
This is someone else.

144
I can't decide between the two.

145
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

146
...really smart and a lot of fun.

147
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

148
She's just as pretty.

149
I guess she's smart.

150
She's not fun.

151
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

152
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

153
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

154
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

155
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

156
- Hey.
- Hey.

157
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

158
Damn!

159
- Hey.
- Hey.

160
What happened to your fancy jacket?

161
They baked it.

162
I can't take this anymore.

163
- I'm going to fire you tonight.
- You got it. Oh, oh!

164
What are you doing?

165
You're still on fire there.

166
I think you got it!

167
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

168
Like father, like son.

169
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

170
This could, maybe, get serious.

171
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

172
Well, you know, possibly.

173
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

174
Uh, no?

175
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

176
- You don't tell him that!
- Why not?

177
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...

178
I see.

179
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

180
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

181
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

182
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

183
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

184
Hey, Dragon!

185
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

186
There's $300 in this one.

187
People get generous
around the holidays.

188
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

189
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

190
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish...

191
Why is nobody writing these?

192
We can remember them.

193
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

194
Sure, that too.

195
Forget the specials for a minute.
Um, here's the thing...

196
For the last two weeks I have, uh...

197
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

198
Can't hear you!

199
Positive atmosphere.

200
But I've had it up to here.

201
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

202
...or the highway. All right?

203
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

204
Hey, new guy.

205
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

206
No, ma'am.

207
He has a name. It's Dragon.

208
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

209
We did the hat, right?

210
- What the hell just happened?
- I am so sorry.

211
I was going to do it.

212
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

213
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

214
...it's been a long time since I had...

215
...327 plus $238!

216
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

217
And I got to pay rent!

218
How about you don't fire me.

219
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

220
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

221
What nice things?

222
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

223
Happy Hanukkah,
Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...

224
You know what, Pheebs?

225
I'm not Jewish so...

226
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

227
...but he's not complaining.

228
Bad dream?

229
I wasn't sleeping.

230
What was Phoebe's song about?

231
It's the one with the cat.

232
I got to go.
I've got another date.

233
Did you pick one yet?

234
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

235
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

236
So I'm still torn.

237
You don't like the one from uptown.

238
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

239
Just end them both!

240
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

241
Then break up with uptown.

242
By the time you get home,
you're done!

243
You're right. Thank you.

244
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

245
- Prague?
- So much you don't know.

246
Chandler?

247
Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.

248
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

249
I did! I absolutely did!

250
You idiot!

251
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

252
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

253
Now you scared him away!

254
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

255
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

256
I know, I know!

257
Now I'm right back where I started.

258
This sucks!

259
Being alone sucks!

260
You'll meet somebody.

261
You're a great catch!

262
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

263
- Really?
- Yeah.

264
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

265
No.

266
It doesn't matter.

267
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

268
Cute guys in little shorts?

269
Sure.

270
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

271
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

272
Okay.

273
Have you ever been with a woman?

274
What?

275
What is the matter with you?

276
There is no good time
to ask that question.

277
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

278
Ross?

279
Wake up!

280
Ross? Ross! Ross!

281
I need more swordfish.

282
- Can you get me more swordfish?
- I don't speak English.

283
You just did.

284
I don't know what to tell you.

285
Fine.

286
Very funny.

287
Let me out, please.

288
Come on, I'm cold!

289
And covered in marinara sauce!

290
Let me out!

291
You found that handle, did you?

292
- It's not funny.
- Well, that's not true.

293
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

294
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

295
If you want me
to quit this bad then...

296
Hey. Chef Geller?

297
You know that speech you made?

298
I got a problem with it!

299
- You do?
- You bet I do!

300
I just, uh, wasn't listening then,
that's all.

301
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

302
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

303
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

304
Get out!

305
All right.

306
Anybody else got a problem?

307
How about you, chuckles?

308
You think this is funny now?

309
No.

310
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

311
No, it's really good.

312
Take those salads to table four.

313
And you, get the swordfish!

314
And you!

315
Get a haircut!

316
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

317
What?

318
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

319
Now that I see them, I win!

320
What?

321
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

322
Are we really in Montreal?

323
Yes, we are.

324
So coffee?

325
Coffee sounds great.

326
Wait.

327
So you live in Montreal?

328
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

329
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

330
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

331
Thanks.

332
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

333
Enough!

334
Lean, lean, lean!

335
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap

336
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

337
Said all you need is
To write them a song

338
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

339
No, don't sing along

340
Monica, Monica

341
Have a happy Hanukkah

342
Saw Santa Claus

343
He said hello to Ross

344
And please tell Joey

345
Christmas will be snowy

346
And Rachel and Chandler

347
Happy holidays, everybody!

﻿1
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

2
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

3
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch...

4
Why were you at court?

5
Lunch.

6
We were like...

7
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

8
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

9
Oh, it's so great.

10
Okay.

11
Stop it! Don't!

12
I'll get you a gift now.

13
Is there anything you need?

14
Uh, yeah.

15
We've been trying to get pregnant.
Thought we'd get a jump on things.

16
No one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.

17
Because the thing is, um, we're not
able to, you know, uh, conceive.

18
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

19
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

20
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

21
...and put it into another girl.

22
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

23
That's a really nice gift.

24
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

25
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

26
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

27
What?

28
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

29
You said "black." Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

30
Well, you know what I meant.

31
You messed it up.

32
You're stupid.

33
So what job'd you get?

34
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

35
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

36
They give you
all the information.

37
It's like memorizing a script.

38
On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

39
Very nice.

40
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

41
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

42
Hey!

43
Frank Jr. And Alice got married!

44
Oh, my God!

45
They're having a baby!

46
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

47
- My God!
- Are you serious?

48
Yeah.

49
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

50
Ew! And, oh, no!

51
They want me to be the surrogate.

52
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

53
What did you say?

54
I had to think about it,
but what is there to think of?

55
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

56
You'll carry their child,
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

57
This is an incredible thing to do.

58
But there are things to think about.

59
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean pregnant.

60
I know.

61
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

62
I mean, morning sickness, uh, labor.

63
It's all for somebody else.

64
Yeah. What's your point?

65
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

66
I couldn't do that.

67
I figure, the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

68
And that baby was, you know...

69
...a keeper.

70
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

71
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

72
Just think it through.

73
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

74
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

75
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

76
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

77
I am so jealous.

78
You guys are just right there.

79
Yes.

80
Right where?

81
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

82
...and sex and talking.

83
You got to love the talking.

84
And the sex?

85
We haven't had sex.

86
What's the big deal?
This is special.

87
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

88
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

89
That is really nice...

90
...lying!

91
- No way is that the reason.
- Why?

92
You're not mature enough
to understand that!

93
He's right. I'm totally lying.

94
Then what is it?

95
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

96
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

97
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

98
I was going for the metaphor.

99
I was saying the actual words.

100
He's had girlfriends.
It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

101
We share a wall.

102
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

103
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you are in love.

104
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

105
Just go for it.

106
Yeah, you should.

107
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

108
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

109
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

110
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

111
Shh.

112
This is a museum. No talking.

113
Right down here we have...

114
...a large foot.

115
And over here we have Ross Geller.

116
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

117
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

118
Okay, moving right along.

119
Come on.

120
It's open. Come in.

121
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

122
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

123
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

124
I was working on my pottery.

125
Oh! Oh!

126
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

127
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: Pottery and erotica.

128
Erottery!

129
Hey! Okay!

130
Thanks for coming out to see me.

131
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

132
I don't think it's a good idea.

133
Why not?

134
You'd be giving up a baby.

135
And I really don't...

136
I don't know if anything I say...

137
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

138
So...

139
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

140
No, no. The puppy is yours.

141
I get a puppy?

142
But for only three days.

143
Why?

144
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parenty on you now.

145
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

146
I know what I'm talking about.

147
I gave up two babies.

148
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

149
...how terrible it is.

150
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

151
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

152
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

153
I shouldn't have given you
the puppy first.

154
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

155
You mean Dr. Geller?

156
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

157
Oh, he won't sit here.

158
Only people in white coats
sit there.

159
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

160
How come?

161
That's how it is.

162
That's crazy.

163
It's crazy in a perfect world:
A world without lab coats and blazers.

164
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

165
See that scientist?

166
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now...

167
Peter! Hey, Peter!

168
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?

169
I shared my pudding with you, man!

170
I gave you my snack pack!

171
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

172
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

173
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

174
...but Ross is my friend.

175
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

176
Ross. Ross.

177
Here! I saved you a seat!

178
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

179
This is saved.

180
Gift shop.

181
I'm sorry about
what happened today.

182
You do what you got to do.

183
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

184
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

185
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

186
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

187
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

188
Look, Ross.

189
It's no big deal.

190
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

191
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

192
I understand, you know?

193
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

194
So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.

195
I'll see you tomorrow.

196
When we're in the audience,
he does wave.

197
- Hi.
- Hey.

198
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

199
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

200
- Come on, let's go to the balcony.
- What?

201
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

202
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

203
So did you do it?

204
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

205
Uh-oh. It was bad?

206
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

207
She was like, uh, "I see your point.
I'm all right with it."

208
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

209
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

210
Look, you have to help me.

211
I mean...

212
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

213
I need to know...

214
...what makes it go from nice to...

215
..."My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

216
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

217
All right.

218
Now.

219
You don't have to draw an actual...
Whoa, she's hot!

220
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

221
You got one, two, three...

222
...four...

223
...five, six and seven.

224
There are seven?

225
Let me see that.

226
Oh, yeah.

227
That's one?

228
Kind of an important one.

229
I was looking at it upside down.

230
Well, you know sometimes that helps.

231
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

232
That's bad?

233
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

234
You might if it were like seven.

235
The important thing is
to take your time.

236
You want to hit them all...

237
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

238
Oh, toes!

239
For some people.

240
All right.

241
You could, uh, start out
with a little one.

242
A two.

243
A one, two, three.

244
A three.

245
A five.

246
A four.

247
A three, two.

248
Two. A two, four, six.

249
Two, four, six.

250
Four. Two.

251
Two. Four, seven!

252
Five, seven! Six, seven!

253
Seven! Seven!

254
Seven, seven, seven!

255
Seven!

256
Dr. Geller? There's a seat here.

257
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

258
But I'm having my lunch...

259
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

260
I'm eating...

261
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

262
If he'll sit with me.

263
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

264
You know...

265
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

266
And yet, there is something...

267
...unnatural...

268
...about the way we eat lunch.

269
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

270
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

271
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

272
Now, I say we shed these coats...

273
...that separate us.

274
And we get to know
the people underneath.

275
I'm Ross!

276
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

277
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

278
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

279
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

280
- There you go!
- Hang in there, Teddy!

281
I'm Andrew.

282
And I didn't pay for this pear.

283
Okay. Good for you.

284
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

285
Wow, Rhonda.

286
- I'm Scott.
- Yeah, okay, Scott!

287
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

288
...or my family will die.

289
My mom will be here soon.

290
I can't. I can't give him up.

291
Yes, no. I can.

292
I don't want to.

293
But I can.

294
No.

295
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.

296
You know, I never saw that.

297
Oh, it was only okay.

298
I can't do this.

299
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

300
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

301
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

302
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

303
We were in the neighborhood.

304
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

305
None.

306
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

307
Okay.

308
Who's this little guy?

309
Oh, um, well...

310
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

311
You are so precious,
I'd take you home.

312
Why don't you?

313
Are you serious?

314
Uh-huh. Yeah.

315
Thanks.

316
- What are you doing?
- I'm okay with this.

317
You know why?
Because look at them.

318
Look how happy they are.

319
And I made that, so you know...

320
...it'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby. But God!

321
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

322
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

323
Oh!

324
Thank you so much!

325
You don't know what this means to us.

326
I think I'm going to cry!

327
It's going to be so great.

328
Hi.

329
- What's going on?
- I gave them the puppy.

330
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

331
- Phoebe...
- No, I know.

332
We're different, though.

333
This is a different situation.

334
I am not going to regret this.

335
I understand all that.

336
It's just, that was my puppy.

337
Oh!

338
Would you ever be a surrogate?

339
Depends who asked.

340
What if I asked?

341
Oh, Mon, sure!

342
- Really?
- Yes.

343
- You're not asking me, are you?
- No.

344
Yes. Totally.

345
Thank you! Thank you!

346
Thank you!

347
Yes, thank you!

﻿1
What the hell is that?

2
What the hell is that? Is that you?

3
- Boy, you're really not a morning person.
- Just back off!

4
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
What is that noise?

6
You.

7
It's the chick.

8
She's going through some changes.

9
What kind of changes?

10
Well, the vet seems to think
that she's becoming a rooster.

11
We're getting a second opinion.

12
Hey, what are you doing shopping
at 8 in the morning?

13
Well, I've been up since 6...

14
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

15
You guys,
you really should get rid of those animals.

16
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

17
Yeah, especially not with all these
knives and cookbooks around.

18
All right, I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor
and, uh, see if I'm ready...

19
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

20
Now, how will they know if you're ready?

21
Oh, they're just gonna look and see
if my endometrial layer is thick.

22
Oh, I can check that for you.

23
Okay, everyone, think "thick."

24
Good luck.

25
- Hey. Wish me luck.
- Hey.

26
- Oh, good luck.
- Good luck.

27
- And I'm still right.
- That is so not true.

28
What?

29
She's mad because I know
today's her laundry day...

30
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

31
I can check that for you.

32
I just can't believe that you think that you
and Chandler know me and Rachel...

33
...better than we know you.

34
Well, we do.

35
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

36
Yeah, what's that about?

37
And you. Ross,
I believe if you check Rachel's bag...

38
...you will find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

39
You're good.

40
These are not.

41
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

42
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

43
Ross, how many items left in that bag?

44
- Five.
- Okay.

45
Ten bucks says that we can name
every item in that bag.

46
- How many guesses do you get?
- Six.

47
Challenge extended.

48
- Deal.
- Challenge accepted.

49
All right, we'll start with...

50
...apples.

51
We'll be starting with apples.

52
Stop that now.

53
Yes.

54
Okay. Uh, tortilla chips.

55
- Yogurt.
- Diet soda.

56
Yes, yes, yes.

57
- Orange juice.
- No, there's no orange juice in there.

58
- We win.
- Ha, ha.

59
They have another guess.

60
Okay, well, we won that one.

61
Okay. The last thing is...

62
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

63
No, no. Not for, like, another two weeks.

64
I got it. Scotch...

65
...tape.

66
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

67
Well, we used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

68
Oh, man.

69
All right. Ten bucks. Fork it over.

70
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

71
Give me it.

72
That does not mean you know us better.
I want a rematch.

73
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery
questions. Real personal questions.

74
Yeah. And the winner gets 100 bucks.

75
Serious?

76
Are you scared?

77
No.

78
Okay, who makes up the questions?

79
Ross will do it.

80
Oh, sure, Ross will do it.

81
It's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

82
Well, fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

83
No, no, no, I wanna play.

84
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

85
Oh, I knew it. I knew it.
I felt really thick this morning.

86
- Ha, ha.
- Okay, so, what's now?

87
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

88
Okay. It'll take just a little while
to prepare the embryos.

89
- Embryos? As in more than one?
- Mm-hm. Five, actually.

90
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth...

91
...in a hospital
or a big box under the stairs?

92
Ha, ha. We do five because
that gives you a 25-percent chance...

93
...that at least one will attach.

94
That's it? Twenty-five percent?

95
That means that it's, like,
75-percent chance of no baby at all?

96
Yeah, you know, I was thinking,
what are the odds...

97
...if, like, you stuff, like,
200 of them in there?

98
Sweetie, now...

99
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

100
Okay, well, you know what? Don't worry.

101
I'm gonna do this as many times
as it takes to get it right.

102
Well, see, the thing is,
we kind of only have one shot.

103
Um, it costs $16,000
each time you do this.

104
So, um, we're kind of using all the money
we have to do it just this one time.

105
Whoa.

106
That's... Okay, that's a lot of pressure
on me and my uterus.

107
So... Well, okay.

108
So maybe there's something that I can do,
you know, just to make sure I get pregnant.

109
No, I'm sorry.

110
Wow, you guys
really don't know anything.

111
I know. Why doesn't she get drunk?

112
That worked for a bunch of girls
in my high school.

113
Hey, guys. Do you realize
that any minute now...

114
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

115
I know, I know.

116
- It's such a huge, life-altering thing.
- I know.

117
The test is ready.

118
Okay. Each team will answer
10 questions.

119
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

120
The categories are
"Fears And Pet Peeves"...

121
..."Ancient History"...

122
..."Literature"...

123
...and "It's All Relative."

124
Now, the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

125
Okay.

126
- Somebody call it this time.
- Yeah.

127
Tails.

128
- It's heads.
- Yeah!

129
Gentlemen, pick your category.

130
"Fears And Pet Peeves."

131
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"

132
- Animals dressed as humans.
- That's correct.

133
- Ladies?
- Same category.

134
Okay.

135
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?"

136
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

137
That is correct.

138
The Irish jig guy?

139
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body.

140
Gentlemen, your pick.

141
"It's All Relative."

142
"Monica and I had
a grandmother who died.

143
You both went to her funeral.

144
Name that grandmother."

145
- Nana?
- She has a real name.

146
- Althea.
- Althea?

147
- What are you doing?
- Took a shot.

148
Shooting with Althea?

149
- Althea is correct.
- Nice shooting.

150
We'll take "Literature."

151
"Every week, the TV Guide comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

152
What name appears
on the address label?"

153
Oh! Chandler gets it. It's Chandler Bing.

154
No.

155
I'm afraid the TV Guide
comes to "Chanandler Bong."

156
I knew that.

157
Rachel, use your head.

158
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.

159
Hello, teeny embryos.

160
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi.

161
I'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

162
You should know that
we're doing this for Frank and Alice...

163
...who you know. You've been there.

164
Um...

165
You know, they want you so much.

166
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

167
Okay, and I promise that I'll keep you
safe and warm...

168
...until, you know, you're ready
to have them take you home.

169
So...

170
Okay.

171
Oh, and also, next time you see me,
if I'm screaming, don't worry.

172
That's what's supposed to happen.

173
- Ready?
- Uh-huh?

174
Good luck.

175
All right, the score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

176
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick your category.

177
"It's All Relative"!

178
- You don't have to shout everything.
- I'm sorry!

179
Ooh. "What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

180
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?"

181
Viva Las Gaygas.

182
Unfortunately, that is correct.

183
Yes.

184
All right. We have a tie.

185
Luckily, I've prepared
for such an event.

186
- The Lightning Round.
- Ooh.

187
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

188
You guys are dead.

189
I am so good at Lightning Rounds.

190
I majored in Lightning Rounds,
all right?

191
- We're gonna destroy you.
- Want to bet?

192
Oh, I'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

193
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?

194
One hundred and fifty dollars.

195
Say 200?

196
Two hundred dollars.

197
You're doing it again.

198
Excuse me.

199
- Monica, I don't want to lose $200.
- We won't.

200
- Okay.
- Three hundred?

201
- Monica.
- I'm just trying to spice it up.

202
Okay, so then play for some pepper.
Stop spending my money.

203
I got it.

204
How about if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

205
Ooh, that's interesting.

206
Hey, no way. That rooster's family.

207
- Throw in the duck too.
- What do you have against the duck?

208
- It doesn't make noise.
- Well, he gets the other one all riled up.

209
- Look, we are not...
- All right, hold on.

210
If you win...

211
...we give up the bird.
- Aah!

212
But if we win...

213
...we get your apartment.

214
Ooh!

215
Deal!

216
Monica, betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.

217
Rachel, I have not missed
one question the whole game.

218
I own this game.

219
Look at my hand.

220
Why, do you have the answers
written on there?

221
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

222
- All right, let's do it. Okay.
- Come on.

223
All right. Gentlemen, you're up first.

224
Okay.

225
You have 30 seconds.

226
The Lightning Round begins...

227
Stop it.

228
Now. "What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field-hockey goalie?"

229
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct.

230
"Rachel claims
this is her favorite movie."

231
- Dangerous Liaisons.
- Correct.

232
- "Her actual favorite is?" Correct.
- Weekend at Bernie's.

233
"In what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 14?"

234
Oh!

235
Ew, no!

236
Her ear.

237
All right, "Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

238
- Okay, everyday use.
- Fancy.

239
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

240
- Two seconds.
- Uh, eleven?

241
Eleven. Unbelievable.
Eleven is correct.

242
Yes!

243
All right.

244
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up.

245
All right, all right, come on!

246
Thirty seconds on the clock.

247
Five correct questions wins the game.

248
The Lightning Round begins now.
"What is Joey's favorite food?"

249
- Sandwiches.
- Correct.

250
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"

251
- Fourteen?
- No, 19.

252
Thanks, man.

253
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

254
- His name was..."
- Maurice.

255
- "His profession was?"
- Space cowboy.

256
Correct.

257
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

258
Oh.

259
Oh, gosh.
It has something to do with numbers.

260
- And processing.
- And he carries a briefcase.

261
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose the game.

262
It has something to do
with transponding.

263
Oh! Oh! He's a transponster.

264
That's not even a word!

265
I can get this. I can get this.

266
No!

267
Yes!

268
- I call Monica's room.
- You can't just call Monica's room.

269
Sure I can. Standard Shotgun Rules.
I'm in sight of the room and I called it.

270
Damn.

271
Man, I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

272
- Oh.
- Yeah.

273
Bet you can't guess what color
my tonsils are. I bet the apartment.

274
Oh, I would never bet this apartment.
It's too nice.

275
- Hey.
- Ooh, Pheebs, are they in there?

276
Um, yeah, uh-huh, I'm implanted.

277
- How do you feel?
- Well, freaked.

278
Because it turns out the odds
are, like, really sucky.

279
And this is Frank and Alice's,
like, only shot.

280
I mean, they are, like, literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

281
Yeah, but I bet it works.

282
Really? How much?

283
All right, I'm gonna go take
a pregnancy test right now.

284
Oh, wow. You can tell this soon?

285
Well, the doctor says
it takes a couple days.

286
But, I mean, my body's always been
a little faster than Western medicine, so...

287
Oh, my God. I can't believe you guys
actually think you're moving in here.

288
Well, believe it, baby.

289
Well, I'm not moving.

290
What?

291
No. It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

292
You just can't ignore the bet. It's a bet.

293
You bet on a bet, and if you lose,
you lose the bet.

294
Rach, we have to move.

295
If we had lost, we would have
made them get rid of the birds.

296
No.

297
All right, look, I hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

298
...this is all your fault.

299
- What?
- Chanandler Bong.

300
Come on, we steal that TV Guide
every week.

301
I knew it.

302
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

303
Cool. Girl roommate.

304
Well?

305
Nope, not knocked up yet.

306
It's only been a couple hours,
so just give it some time.

307
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile,
I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this...

308
...so I'm just gonna, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

309
You know, just...

310
Yeah, good. I'm gonna let gravity,
you know, do its jobs.

311
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand
with this box?

312
No. Put that box down.
We are not going anywhere!

313
This is my apartment and I like it.

314
This is a girl's apartment.

315
That is a boy's apartment.
It's dirty and it smells.

316
This is pretty. It's so pretty.

317
And look, and it's purple.

318
And I'm telling you, you with
your steady hand, I am not moving.

319
And now I have got the steady hand.

320
- I'll take care of it.
- That's right.

321
You do what the hand says.

322
- How'd it go?
- I lost our mattresses.

323
Are you in there, little fetus?

324
In nine months, will you come greet us?

325
I will buy you some Adidas

326
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
Oh, hi, Phoebe?

328
Um, we were just at the drugstore,
um, so we got you a little present.

329
Um, it's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

330
Hey, don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

331
So, um, you feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

332
All right. I will. No, I will.

333
But, um, you know, just remember
that it's still really early.

334
Okay, so if it says
that I'm not pregnant...

335
...that doesn't mean
I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay?

336
And just, please,
just so I don't go completely nuts...

337
...just try not to put all your hopes
on this, okay?

338
Okay.

339
Great.

340
You know what? You are mean boys
who are just being mean.

341
Hey, don't get mad at us.
No one forced you to raise the stakes.

342
That is not true. She did. She forced me.

343
We'd still be here if you hadn't
got the question wrong.

344
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!

345
Don't blame the questions!

346
Would you all stop yelling
in our apartment?

347
You are ruining moving day for us.

348
- Would you stop calling it your apartment?
- It is ours.

349
Guys, you guys,
you're gonna have a baby.

350
They're gonna have a baby.

351
My sister's going to have my baby!

352
Okay, but this can't be good
for the baby.

353
I can't find garbage bags.

354
Oh, I think I saw some in here.

355
What is it?

356
I don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

357
I can't believe we're living here.

358
What? What is it?

359
Did you see the size of the closets?

360
I can't believe we live here.

﻿1
Okay, she is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

2
I get to have sex
with the star of the play.

3
- People can hear you.
- I know.

4
- Wow, she looks great, doesn't she?
- Mm.

5
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
That is one good-looking man.

7
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

8
So, you been doing this long?

9
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

10
Oh, yeah.

11
Ooh, that's nice.

12
Dude.

13
- Is that an expensive blouse?
- If you want it to be.

14
Here's your girlfriend's button.

15
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your
old blouses and dresses from high school?

16
Yeah, I think I have some
around here somewhere. Why?

17
Well, it's just maternity clothes
are so expensive.

18
Hey, Rach, I made a pile
of your stuff on this side of your room.

19
- If you could just...
- Ugh!

20
- Throw your purses at it.

21
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

22
- Oh, my God. Are you out of a job?
- No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...

23
...which is just a huge step down.

24
Personal Shopping, what is that?

25
Like where you walk around
with snooty rich people...

26
...and tell them what to buy?

27
- Uh-huh.
- That sounds great.

28
Hey.

29
Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.

30
You can't eat our food anymore.
That gravy train has ended.

31
There's gravy?

32
If you have the big apartment, then deal
with people coming over all the time.

33
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay?
That's your apartment now.

34
- What are you doing?
- I think I left a doughnut up here.

35
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
Oh, how was Kathy's play?

37
Well, Kathy gets half-naked
and simulates sex...

38
...with a real good-looking guy.

39
Yeah, it was like somebody
wrote down my worst nightmare...

40
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

41
That's a good idea for a business.

42
I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be
hot and heavy on-stage every night...

43
...and then they're gonna go to their
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.

44
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your
boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"

45
And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."

46
That is a good trick.

47
All right, look, look.
What am I gonna do?

48
Chandler, look, they're actors.
They're there to do a job.

49
Just because they work together
doesn't mean they'll get together.

50
Just because it happened
with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

51
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen
with them.

52
Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

53
- Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
- Yeah.

54
Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

55
They're not a couple.

56
Oh, okay, I get the game now.

57
Okay, look, look.
Let me ask you a question.

58
When they were doing it on-stage,
was it like really hot?

59
Huh. Oh, yeah.

60
Well, okay, so then you're fine.

61
Look, the rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

62
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

63
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

64
It's when the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

65
Really?

66
You guys have been to every play
I've been in.

67
Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?

68
- No.
- No.

69
So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play
with me tonight?

70
You know what? I don't know
how comfortable I am...

71
...going to see how hot the sex is
between some guy and your girlfriend.

72
- Yeah, I know...
- No, no, no, oh, I'm there.

73
- Hey.
- Hey, Mon.

74
- Want some pancakes?
- You made pancakes?

75
Yep. Grab a plate.

76
No, no. Stay right there.

77
Getting closer.

78
Don't worry...

79
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles...

80
...and jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.

81
Also we're watching the game here
Saturday, if people want to come over.

82
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

83
I was having people over for the game.

84
Oh, yeah? Who's playing?

85
The players.

86
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

87
Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief,
is what it is, is what it is.

88
All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.

89
Oh.

90
Monica, I'm quitting.

91
I just helped an 81 -year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

92
I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

93
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

94
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

95
Oh! Mr. Waltham?
I, uh, really need to talk to you.

96
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

97
And you have a customer.

98
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Joshua.

99
Hi, I'm Rachel Green.
What can I do for you, Joshua?

100
Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife...
Well, my ex-wife...

101
Oh, I'm so sorry.

102
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

103
So I got away with two things: This suit
and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.

104
Well, at least that's a great suit.

105
Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

106
So I need everything down to underwear.

107
So if you're willing, I'm, uh...
I'm all yours.

108
Okay.

109
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?

110
No, no, that wasn't me.

111
Well, we should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

112
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

113
- Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.
- It's this way? Sorry.

114
Oh.

115
I'm right, right? There was, like,
no chemistry between them.

116
Before, they had heat.
And now there's no heat.

117
Now, you know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

118
Let's not jump to any conclusions,
all right?

119
There was some sexual chemistry
between them.

120
Oh, come on.
It was like cousins having sex up there.

121
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay?
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

122
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

123
Oh, thank you so much
for coming again.

124
- Did you like it tonight?
- Absolutely.

125
Mm.

126
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

127
Mm!

128
- It's a good play, isn't it?
- Mm.

129
I loved the play.
Uh, yeah, you were great.

130
And, uh, Nick, ditto.

131
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

132
Okay.

133
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

134
Oh, come on. It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

135
Okay, let me just get this straight.

136
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

137
You know,
I can see how this could happen.

138
You know, you're up there every night,
naked, touching, kissing.

139
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

140
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

141
Well, you can understand,
given how we started.

142
Oh, wow.

143
I can't believe you're throwing that
in my face.

144
Well, that is what happened,
and I don't even see you denying this.

145
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
Why don't you call me when you grow up?

146
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen
any time soon.

147
Oh, I have the best job
in the entire world.

148
The most adorable guy
came over today...

149
...and I got to dress him up all day.

150
Rachel has a new doll.

151
Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get
a Rachel doll and bump them together...

152
...and make kissing noises.

153
Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

154
Oh, Joshua.

155
Joshua, Josh.

156
Uh, hello?

157
Hi.

158
Ooh, what do I smell?

159
I don't know, but it smells good.

160
- Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven.
- Ooh!

161
- Please have some.
- Oh, yo.

162
I've just been fiddling around in here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

163
Wow. The new Playboy.

164
Yeah, just something I picked up.

165
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever.

166
What? What?

167
Nothing, it's just something Joshua said
about V-necks, but you had to be there.

168
How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?

169
- It's Joshua.
- Oh, whatever.

170
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.

171
- Well, hate to eat and run.
- No, wait, please don't go.

172
I've got porn for you too.

173
Yeah, I don't need it.

174
People are supposed
to want to hang out here.

175
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?

176
I'm the hostess.

177
Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.

178
I mean, even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

179
I served the best air.

180
Why did you make a whole big thing...

181
...out of everyone has to hang out
in the big apartment?

182
Because they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

183
But I'm done now.
They've suffered enough.

184
If you wanted to punish them, you
should have just made them hang out here.

185
That's true.

186
All right, this place will be 10 times better
than that place.

187
Oh, are we gonna trash their place?

188
Steps.

189
Slut.

190
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.

191
- What?
- So you were right?

192
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.

193
I don't live here.

194
- Chandler.
- Chandler, what did she say?

195
Wait, are you sure?

196
Well, I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

197
So then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's...

198
- Beefsteak Charlie's?
- Yes.

199
See, you and I have always been like:

200
Oops.

201
- Hey, do you need help with that?
- No, I got it.

202
Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

203
- Hey.
- Hey.

204
So I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

205
- It's so frustrating.
- Why don't you ask him out?

206
Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.

207
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

208
Ooh, that's the turn-on.

209
He just got a divorce, right? So he's
probably really nervous around women.

210
You know? Maybe you just need
to make the first move.

211
- I've never asked a guy out before.
- You've never asked a guy out?

212
No, have you?

213
Thousands of times. Ha, ha.

214
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

215
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

216
Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

217
"Hey.

218
How you doing?"

219
Oh, please.

220
Hey.

221
How you doing?

222
You know what? I'm gonna do that.

223
I'm gonna call him up
and I'm gonna ask him out.

224
- Yeah.
- I can do that. Ask him out.

225
"How you doing?"

226
Hi, Joshua?

227
It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.

228
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
if you, um...

229
If you, um...

230
Left your wallet at the store today?

231
Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...

232
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

233
Uh, well, let's see.
This license belongs to a, uh...

234
Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

235
And, um, yeah.

236
So okay. So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

237
- You've done that a thousand times?
- I've never done that.

238
Oh, God, I just got so nervous
that he was gonna say no.

239
Well, you gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like, uh, Knicks tickets.

240
Invite the guy to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

241
- Really? You think that will work?
- Absolutely, and if doesn't, can I go?

242
- What the heck is that?
- What is that?

243
Did she call?

244
No. Sorry.

245
- Well, maybe I should call her.
- No.

246
Forget her, man. You don't need her.
Don't need that.

247
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

248
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

249
How might you be wrong?

250
Well, you know, what if she didn't
actually sleep with the guy?

251
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

252
She did not have to tell me.
I saw the play and there was no heat.

253
- Back me up here, Ross.
- That's all your basing this on?

254
That's not backing me up.

255
You said, you know,
with the off-stage and the heat...

256
...and the on-stage and the heat...
- Whoa, whoa.

257
That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.

258
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

259
Oh, my God.

260
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with..."

261
"You know, it's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets to..."

262
No. Okay. Um...

263
"Who likes the Knicks?"

264
- What do you think?
- Oh.

265
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

266
...I think you look great.

267
- Huh. Yeah?
- Yup.

268
Oh, yeah, you look great.

269
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.

270
Um, so you like it?

271
I do, I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.

272
- Great.
- Well, thank you so much for all your help.

273
- Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

274
Thanks.

275
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
with the... For the bathing suits.

276
You don't want to do that now?

277
Oh, that's okay.

278
Anyway,
hopefully I'll see you around sometime.

279
Basketball.

280
Sorry?

281
I, uh...

282
I have two tickets to the Knicks game
tonight if you're interested...

283
...just as a thank-you for this week.

284
Wow. That would be great.

285
- Really?
- Yeah, That would be fantastic.

286
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.

287
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

288
- Good morning.
- Hi.

289
Oh.

290
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

292
You know, I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

293
And I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

294
Oh, wow.

295
I really wish you'd called me.

296
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

297
But, you know,
I think this is a good thing. You know?

298
Because we've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

299
You know, I mean, I know for me, but...

300
Nick's pants?

301
Yeah.

302
Yeah. Well.

303
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one.

304
- Okay, for next time, what do you say?
- "I have an extra ticket."

305
"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets."
I have and extra ticket.

306
So the first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

307
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game, isn't he?

308
I got the date. I'm just not on it.

309
Okay, it's ready.

310
- Come on.
- What's ready?

311
Just come.

312
Oh, my God.

313
- Wow.
- Monica, this is beautiful.

314
Oh, did you work for two days straight?

315
Pretty much.

316
So, what do you think of the floor?

317
I don't know. Looks the same.

318
You used to have carpet.

319
Oh, yeah.

320
So I made snacks.

321
Please, just hang out, okay?

322
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

323
Mon, do you want us to come back later?

324
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.
Just keep talking.

325
I'm always the hostess.

326
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

327
- So?
- Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.

328
- Oh, good.
- She is now.

329
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

330
You think you know a person...

331
...then they turn around
and they sleep with Nick.

332
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

333
I hate him. And I hate her.

334
Well, I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault, really.

335
- Oh.
- How? How is it your fault?

336
Because, ugh, I should have called.

337
You know, if I'd just called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick...

338
...and they wouldn't have ended up
in bed together.

339
I threw her at his man-nipples.

340
Honey, this is not your fault.

341
Just because you guys had a fight
does not justify her sleeping with someone.

342
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

343
Rachel, one of your customers seems
to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

344
- Really?
- Will you call him?

345
Yes, I will. Absolutely.

346
Oh.

347
Hello, Rachel.

348
Hi, Joshua.

349
I left my wallet here on purpose.

350
Really?

351
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.

352
Oh, I'm glad.

353
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.

354
Yes?

355
How you doing?

﻿1
So, now, what is this, now?

2
- Googlie Worm.
- Ha-ha-ha.

3
And this?

4
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

5
Bait is so funny.

6
Hey, um, what's this?

7
Oh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
Oh, Geller's got one hooked.
Oh! Looks like a big one. Oh! Oh!

9
It's the classic struggle between man...

10
Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
Hey, you know what's gonna be great
about the fishing trip?

12
When my dad gives me that, "Joey,
what are you doing with your life?" stuff...

13
...I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston, Dad.

14
- What are you doing with your life?"
- Aw.

15
You don't have to stop having fun
just because I'm here.

16
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

17
Well, except you.

18
I don't think you should
leave Chandler alone.

19
It's only been two days
since he broke up with Kathy.

20
You can go fishing next week.

21
There's nothing I can do right now.
He's still in his sweatpants.

22
That's only phase one.

23
You know? I'll be back for phase two.
I would never miss phase two.

24
What's phase two?

25
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.

26
How does going to a strip club
make him better?

27
There are naked ladies there.

28
It helps him get to phase three,
picturing yourself with other women.

29
- There are naked ladies there too.
- Yeah.

30
Would you give me one minute, please?

31
So these will match the jacket
you picked out for me last week?

32
Mm-hm.

33
There we go.

34
There it is.

35
- Oh, you know what I need?
- Yeah?

36
- Gloves. Brown leather dress gloves.
- Oh, okay.

37
Uh, well, let's see. You're about a...
Well, this one is large. Ha, ha.

38
And, uh, this one...

39
- Also a large?
- Yeah. Okay.

40
- Yeah.
- Two larges coming right up. Ha, ha.

41
- Rachel, could I have a moment?
- Yes.

42
I was wondering, my niece, you see,
is in town from London.

43
- Uh-huh.
- Shropshire, really, but you know.

44
She's about your age, I'd say.

45
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.

46
I was wondering if you would
keep her company this evening.

47
- Sure. You got it.
- Oh, good.

48
Count me in. Me, Fledermaus. Great.
I really...

49
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

50
So?

51
So...

52
- Gloves?
- Oh, right. Sorry, I'll be right back.

53
Actually, you know what? I gotta take off.

54
But I was curious,
do you have any plans for tonight?

55
No, nothing.

56
I invested in this nightclub.
Would you like to come?

57
Yeah, that would be great.

58
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

59
- Well, I guess.
- I'm kidding.

60
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Whew.

61
I'm gonna put you on the VIP list, okay?
Look for me.

62
- Yeah. Great. You betcha.
- I'll see you tonight.

63
- Okay.
- Okay.

64
- I almost forgot the tickets, didn't I?
- What?

65
For you and Emily. Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.

66
Oh. Oh, right.

67
I think you'll like it.
It has two of the Three Tenors.

68
Okay.

69
I can't believe Kathy did this to me.
I really thought that she was the one.

70
Well, I'll tell you what.

71
From now on,
I am not getting out of this chair, ever.

72
Okay? From now on,
this chair is the one.

73
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

74
Come on, man,
just take the sweats off, okay?

75
Just take them off
and we'll have some fun.

76
- Hey.
- Hi.

77
- Did you catch any big fish?
- Oh, my God, you guys have no idea.

78
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my God, you stink.

79
Oh, are you kidding?

80
Three days on the lake without a shower.

81
Plus, I fell into that big tub of worms
at the bait stand.

82
Hey, how's he doing?

83
He hasn't gotten out of that chair
in two days.

84
Ahem. Hey, buddy, how's it going?

85
You see that?
He just needed his pal to come home.

86
I gotta go memorize my lines.

87
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby.

88
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

89
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
- Hey.
- Hey, Monica.

91
- Uh-oh. What's the matter?
- Oh...

92
Joshua invited me
to this fancy club opening tonight.

93
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

94
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

95
So, what are you gonna do?

96
- I don't know, sweetie.
- No. Help me.

97
- I can't. I have to work.
- Phoebe?

98
I would, but I get my morning sickness
in the evening.

99
Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend
the night holding my hair back for me.

100
Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is...
I have to meet Joshua.

101
This is my one chance
for him to see the fun Rachel.

102
You know, the "Wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

103
Are Joey and Chandler back?

104
Oh, Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

105
Oh.

106
Hi.

107
So?

108
No.

109
Oh, come on.

110
- I think she's here.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Ross, please?

111
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

112
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

113
Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.

114
Oh, she's looking down the hall.

115
She looked right at me.

116
Oh, wait, you can't see people
through that little hole, can you?

117
Hello.

118
- Hello?
- Aah!

119
Oh, I'll be right there.
Okay, Ross, please. Come on.

120
I thought we had moved on.

121
I thought we'd gotten to a place
where we could be happy for each other.

122
I mean, was that just me?

123
- All right, I'll do it.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

124
- Emily?
- Yes.

125
- I'm Rachel Green.
- Thank goodness.

126
There has been a teeny change of plans.
It turns out I'm not free tonight, so...

127
Really? Heh.

128
That's lovely. I must have missed your call,
even though I didn't leave the flat all day.

129
- Well, no, I...
- No, no, no, that's not rude.

130
It's in keeping with a trip...

131
...where I've already been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

132
...and been strip-searched
at John F. Kennedy Airport.

133
Apparently, I look like someone...

134
...who's got a balloon full of cocaine
stuffed up their bum.

135
I think you look great.

136
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you all.

137
I'll get her.

138
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

139
Don't you just love the way they talk?

140
"Ooh. Oh."

141
Oh!

142
- What?
- It kicked. I think the baby kicked.

143
- Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha.

144
Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic
in my underwear busted.

145
Oh, my God. I overslept.

146
I was supposed to be on the set
a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.

147
What? Joey, you can't go like that.
You stink.

148
I fell asleep before I could shower.
Now I don't have time.

149
They're 10 blocks away.
If I run, I can make it.

150
Yeah, run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

151
Hey. Whoa! Slow down.
No, keep moving. Whoa.

152
- So how did it go with Joshua last night?
- Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.

153
But I did punch a girl in the face.

154
- What?
- Why?

155
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring rain.

156
And there was no Rachel Green on the list,
but there was a Rachel Greep.

157
Oh. So did you get to meet her?

158
No, there is no Rachel Greep.
But then this other girl overheard us.

159
And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep,
I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.

160
- So you hit her in the face?
- No, she was already in.

161
But then this big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

162
...so I clocked her.

163
Ugh. I can't believe this.

164
All I wanted was just a few hours
outside of work to see Joshua...

165
...so that he could go ahead
and start falling in love with me.

166
Aw. Pheebs.

167
Honey, that's your name.

168
That's short for Phoebe?
I thought that's what we called each other.

169
- Hey, you're wearing pants.
- That's right.

170
Where are the guys?
I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.

171
- It's 9:30 in the morning.
- They got a breakfast buffet.

172
- Hello? Oh, hey, Ross.
- Ooh. Let me talk to him.

173
Oh, my God.

174
- Can't I just...?
- Shh. Wait, what?

175
- It's my phone and she's shush...
- Shh. Please.

176
What's he saying?

177
He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast
in Vermont.

178
What? Oh, my God.

179
Who the hell is Emily? No.

180
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

181
Ow.

182
How did he end up in Vermont
with that awful witch?

183
Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.

184
When we met her...

185
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.

186
Who wouldn't be miserable?

187
Once I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.

188
Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

189
I gotta go! There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

190
He had to go. There was a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

191
I don't get this. She was horrible.

192
Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.

193
- Why do you care so much, anyway?
- I don't care.

194
You know what? I'm just upset
that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

195
Know what? Still, you do not just meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont.

196
Well, when you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

197
Ugh. You know, could you just for once
not remember every little thing?

198
So, you know, when's he getting back?

199
- A couple of days.
- Know what?

200
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

201
What are you doing?

202
Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.

203
Yes, you can. You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

204
Why don't you just...? Why don't you do
your phase-two strip-club thing with us?

205
- Yeah, come on, we can be guys.
- Heh. No, you can't.

206
Come on, let us be guys.
Maybe we wanna be guys.

207
You don't wanna be guys.

208
You'd be all hairy
and you wouldn't live as long.

209
You know, you...

210
Would you just stop being such a wuss
and get those off?

211
And you come with us
and watch naked girls dance around.

212
Okay.

213
I'm sorry.

214
Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.

215
Calm down, we got time.
We're running a little late.

216
Oh.

217
All set.

218
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.

219
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with...

220
Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

221
- You.
- Oh.

222
I could see why you would think that.
But actually, you know who I think it is?

223
- You?
- No, no. It's Heston.

224
- What?
- The man reeks.

225
Smells like he went on a three-day
fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.

226
There's no way he smells.

227
He's the only one around here
with a shower in his dressing room.

228
Really? A shower, huh?
And, uh, which room might that be?

229
The one with "Heston" on it.

230
Interesting.

231
Gonna take my time

232
Hey. I got some ones.
You wanna put them in her panties?

233
No, thanks, Mom.

234
Oh. No. Um, hi. That, that.

235
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant, so...

236
Well, maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

237
Heh, heh. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.

238
Very good. Yes. That was so good.

239
Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.

240
Well, I just checked our messages,
and Joshua didn't call.

241
I mean, you would think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

242
Ugh. And you know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

243
Come on, look where you are.

244
- Another round of daiquiris.
- Remember, virgin for me, please.

245
Oh, and don't let me leave
without getting the name of that carpet guy.

246
Oh, come on.

247
You know what?
I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.

248
- Well, if you think it'll help.
- No. That was a test.

249
In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk
and wanna call Kathy...

250
...and you have to stop me.

251
Then I'm gonna be so drunk,
I'm gonna wanna call Janice.

252
- You should. How is she?
- Oh!

253
I think somebody
needs another lap dance.

254
Hello? Who's in there?

255
How you doing?

256
Who in the hell are you?

257
Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?

258
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

259
No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.

260
See, I'm an actor.

261
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

262
And, well, I stink.

263
- You're in this picture?
- Yeah, yeah.

264
I'm one of the cops who won't work
with you because you're a loose cannon.

265
Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just...
I stink.

266
- Joey, right?
- Yeah.

267
Every actor, one time or another... Ah.

268
Every actor thinks he stinks.

269
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

270
- Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

271
- Listen to me.
- No... Yeah.

272
I don't know one actor worth his salt...

273
...who one time in his career didn't say,
"God, I stink."

274
Hell, I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

275
But the important thing
that you must remember...

276
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

277
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower.

278
Do you understand me?

279
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
- Wait a minute.

280
- Take your pants.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

281
- So we did okay at the strip club, right?
- Oh, yeah. That was great.

282
Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress there is quitting...

283
...to teach the third grade.

284
I can't believe it. He still hasn't called.

285
- Who, Josh?
- It's "Joshua."

286
- What, he doesn't like "Josh"?
- No, I don't.

287
All right.
Well, I'm gonna put my sweats back on.

288
No, wait. You know what?
You were right.

289
We really weren't great at being guys.
But do you know why?

290
Because we're girls.

291
- Yeah.
- Do you know what girls are good at?

292
Stripping.

293
No, listening. Sit.

294
You know, maybe it would really,
really help if you would just talk.

295
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

296
Yeah.

297
And you know, if you wanna cry,
that's okay too.

298
Okay, look,
I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.

299
Come on, Chandler.

300
Look, forget it.
We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.

301
Those strippers were insanely hot...

302
...and I couldn't picture myself
with any of them.

303
- They really were pretty, weren't they?
- Oh.

304
- I really liked that fighter pilot one.
- Oh, Candy?

305
- Oh, she was so spunky.
- Yeah.

306
You know,
I think if I were gonna be with a woman...

307
...it'd be with someone like Michelle.

308
She was... Oh, she was just so petite.

309
See, I don't know.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

310
- Oh, Chantal, yeah.
- Chantal.

311
You know? Oh, my God. The... Oh.

312
She had the smoothest skin.

313
I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill
in her G-string and grazed her thigh...

314
Phase three!

315
I just achieved phase three!

316
Really?

317
I am totally picturing you
with all those women.

318
- That's not phase three.
- Well, I'm there too.

319
- Well, are we all together in a group?
- Stop it, you're killing me.

320
I think I just moved on to phase four.

321
- Oh, what is that?
- Where I don't want a relationship ever.

322
I just wanna have sex with strippers
and my friends.

323
Come on. Let me see that smile.

324
I don't wanna.

325
Please?

326
I wanted to go to the strip club.

327
You're gonna have plenty of chances,
okay?

328
There are thousands of women out there
who are just waiting to screw me over.

329
Yeah, all right.

330
- Hey.
- Hey.

331
Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?

332
Emily is incredible.

333
I mean,
there are no words to describe her.

334
The whole weekend was like a dream.

335
- Oh. And you. Rach. Hey.
- Oh, hey.

336
- You were so right.
- What?

337
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

338
...where we could really be happy
for each other.

339
- Hmm.
- I mean, I...

340
- I admit, I wasn't quite there.
- Mm-hm.

341
You know, I mean,
the thought of you and that Josh guy...

342
- "Joshua."
- Joshua guy at that club...

343
...dancing, having a good time.

344
And the thought of it kind of...

345
- You know?
- Yeah.

346
But now, but now, I'm totally there.

347
I'm finally where you are.

348
Oh, thank goodness.

349
Yeah, and thank you for Emily.

350
Oh, no problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

351
I'm happy for you.

352
Happy for you.

353
Oh, no, happy for you.

354
All right, ladies,
here's what we're gonna do.

355
You are gonna take off my clothes.

356
You two go get the oils.

357
And you constantly scream
at the top of your voice:

358
"Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

359
No, I wanna be with her. I like her.

360
Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts.
Go with your instincts.

361
Wait, what am I doing again?

362
Would you please pay attention?
I could wake up at any moment.

363
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

364
No, no, no, that's not Joshua.

365
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

366
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.

367
What are you doing?

368
All right, listen, I gotta wake up.

﻿1
I'm can't believe
I'm getting my nails done.

2
And you said it was gonna be fun.

3
Which it kind of is.

4
You said there were gonna be other guys.
There are no other guys.

5
- Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
- That's a mailman.

6
That's our mailman.

7
Hi, how are you?

8
Chandler, don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.

9
That does.

10
What am I sitting on?

11
Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman
was scratching when this broke off.

12
- Know who used to have nails like that?
- No.

13
Oh, my God.

14
Joey, let me ask you a question.
This has been driving me crazy.

15
- What does this light switch do?
- Oh, nothing.

16
Didn't it drive you crazy
to not know what it did?

17
I know what it did. Nothing.

18
They wouldn't have put it there
if it didn't do something.

19
- How can you not care?
- Like this:

20
Well, here's another question for you.

21
Do you know what that little silver knob
on the toilet does?

22
- Sure. It flushes it.
- Okay, good.

23
Now, since you know, when you come over,
would you mind actually using it?

24
- Hello.
- Hey. Aah!

25
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Guess who we ran into today?

26
- Janice.
- Is this amazing?

27
- How have you been?
- Well, um, I'm divorced.

28
- Wow.
- Really?

29
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.

30
And there it is.

31
I just came up to say hi. Hi.

32
- You, sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

33
Mwah. I'll see you tonight.

34
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

35
- Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.

36
I can't stand the woman.

37
What?
I thought you were crazy about her.

38
You know all those little annoying things
she did before we fell in love?

39
You know, like her voice and her laugh
and her personality?

40
Well, they're all back, you know.

41
And she's picked up like nine new ones.

42
So, what are you doing bringing her here?
There's people here.

43
Don't worry about it.
I'm taking care of it tonight.

44
You are not. You have never been able
to break up with her.

45
Well, I don't have to break up with her.

46
We're not involved.
I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.

47
I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.

48
My ass is, like, frozen.

49
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

50
I'm telling you.

51
I can't believe
you really walk alone here at night.

52
I mean,
you hear such stories about New York.

53
No, it's really not that bad.

54
I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.

55
Help! Help! Help!

56
No, no, no, Ross.
Ross, these are friends of mine from home.

57
- Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
- Oh. Heh.

58
- Hi, mate.
- Hey.

59
- How are you, man?
- Ha, ha.

60
That was a good one, huh?
I was like, "Help! Help!"

61
So how are you?

62
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

63
...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.

64
You realize we have not seen each other
since the night of that U2 concert?

65
- Ah.
- Oh, my God, I think you're right.

66
Well, actually, the last time you and I
saw each other was the next morning.

67
Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.

68
Heh. Oh, Liam.

69
So, what, were you guys playing soccer
or something?

70
Or should I call it...

71
..."football"? Uh...

72
We were playing rugby.

73
In fact, we're playing a game tomorrow.
You're welcome to play too.

74
Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.

75
Heh. What?

76
What's so funny about that?

77
Well, I mean, you're American,
to start with.

78
You don't really have rugby here.

79
Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here
until 1776 either, so...

80
So good, then.
We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2.

81
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

82
Oh, boy. I just love to sing.

83
Yes, I know that you do.

84
One of the reasons
people were complaining...

85
...was because most of the people had paid
to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."

86
Oh, look at us.

87
Who would've thought that Cupid
had a station at 14th Street Nails?

88
Okay, we have to talk.

89
I'm just getting out
of a very serious relationship.

90
I know.
And I'm just getting out of a marriage.

91
I mean, talk about meant to be.

92
Right. But I just think
this is happening too soon.

93
Oh, too soon, too schmoon.

94
Face it, honey,
I am not letting you get away this time.

95
- I hear you.
- Ha, ha.

96
But unfortunately, my company...

97
...is transferring me overseas.

98
Oh, no.

99
Where to?

100
- To Paris?
- No. No, not Paris.

101
To London? Oh. No, Rome?
Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?

102
Okay, could you just stop talking
for a second?

103
Yemen.

104
That's right. Yes.
I'm being transferred to Yemen.

105
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

106
Well, I will just have to soak up
every ounce of Chandler Bing...

107
...until that moment comes.

108
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

109
- Done?
- Yep.

110
- Hey.
- Hey.

111
What's up?

112
This switch thing
has been driving me crazy.

113
So I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

114
Now, four don't work, which means one
of them has to be controlled by the switch.

115
So I plugged in things in all four outlets
that make noise.

116
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise...

117
...and find out which one it is.

118
I bet I stopped listening before you did.

119
You know,
you also could have used lamps...

120
...and then followed the light.

121
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?

122
All right, so everybody ready?

123
Here we go.

124
There's something.
I hear something. Where is it?

125
It's coming from Joey.

126
Oh, my God. That's so freaky.
Turn him off.

127
With the set scrum in center field.

128
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

129
Could we put on the news?
I think it might be raining.

130
No, just hold on a sec.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

131
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm man enough to play this sport.

132
Dude, you're not even man enough
to order the channel that carries the sport.

133
Hey there, Ross.

134
Hey.

135
Janice.

136
You know, uh,
you really didn't have to help me pack.

137
Oh. When you said
all you were gonna be doing...

138
...between now and the time you leave
is packing...

139
...you really didn't leave me much choice.

140
Well, I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

141
- Hey. What's going on?
- Oh, I'm packing.

142
You know, I'm packing
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

143
Thanks for telling me.

144
I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay?
It's the only way I can get rid of her.

145
Oh. Good one.

146
And Yemen.
That actually sounds like a real country.

147
Hey, Chandler, come on.

148
I'm gonna show you how to roll
your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

149
- It's a real space-saver.
- I do that because it makes me look taller.

150
Hey, Chandler. Come on.

151
Okay.

152
- Joey, trade lives with me.
- Nope.

153
Man, look at this.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.

154
- Look how brutal this is.
- Hey, I can handle it, all right?

155
Oh, please, Ross.

156
You got hurt playing badminton
with my dad.

157
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

158
Okay, Ross, look, look, look.
Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?

159
- It's kind of like a huddle.
- And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?

160
Ross, they're gonna kill you.

161
Why are you doing this, anyway?

162
Well, you should've seen the guy
that she used to go out with.

163
I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.

164
You're kidding. And he plays rugby?
That's so funny.

165
Oh, I see. You did that. All right.

166
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me
playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.

167
So I'm gonna show her
how tough I really am.

168
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right.
You are a tough guy.

169
You're the toughest paleontologist
I know.

170
All right, come on.

171
Look, Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

172
Thanks.

173
Look, don't worry about me.

174
I'll just look real energetic
and stay away from the ball.

175
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.

176
- Ooh.
- Oh!

177
Oh, jeez.

178
Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

179
Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.

180
You're gonna wanna stay away
from that guy and that guy and that one.

181
Dude, they're all huge.

182
They don't look any bigger than me.

183
That's because you're closer to you.

184
So you look bigger to you
from where you are.

185
I'm just gonna go and say hello
to the lads.

186
- All right.
- Okay.

187
Hi.

188
Oh.

189
I kind of liked it.

190
Okay, I know what I've gotta do.
I've gotta go Red Ross.

191
You know, Red Ross?

192
Totally don't know
what you're talking about.

193
That time that we were all waiting in line
for Dances With Wolves...

194
...and that one guy cut in front of us,
and I just lost it?

195
Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.

196
Red Ross!

197
No.

198
You'll see.

199
Liam, do me a favor.

200
Tell the lads to go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

201
You don't say?

202
- Thanks.
- Okay.

203
Good luck, babe.

204
Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.

205
Ross, come on.

206
Ross.

207
Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.

208
Ross, get in.

209
Joey!

210
Oh. You are not gonna believe it.
Joshua came in today, and guess what.

211
- He asked you out?
- No.

212
But I was showing him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

213
Saucy.

214
- What are these?
- Oh. Electrical plans for the building.

215
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?

216
I know that switch has gotta do something.
So I went to City Hall and I got these.

217
All I had to do was pay $25
and wait in line for three hours.

218
Wow. If only more people knew.

219
You know, you really didn't have to take me
to the airport.

220
Oh, please. Every moment is precious.

221
Besides, somebody had to ride
in that other taxi with your luggage.

222
And your friends don't seem to care
very much that you're leaving.

223
Well, we're not really that close.

224
Okay. So I guess this is, uh,
you know, goodbye, then.

225
Oh, no, no.

226
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.

227
Okay, well,
I guess it's just "wait here," then.

228
Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

229
- One ticket to Yemen?
- Oh, no, no, no.

230
I just need a pretend ticket.

231
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

232
What would you give to a kid
if he wanted a ticket to play with?

233
Are you traveling with a child?

234
No.

235
Oh. She's gonna think
that I'm handing you a credit card.

236
But what I'm really gonna do
is hand you a library card.

237
Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

238
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

239
Do you have to stay?

240
American Express?

241
Ross!

242
- Oh.
- Ah.

243
I can't believe they're doing that to him.
I told them to go easy on him.

244
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you...

245
...you know, with the accent, so...

246
- That's just halftime. There's more of this.
- Oh.

247
- Hey.
- Hey.

248
Hey.

249
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh?
That is one fun game.

250
- Right.
- Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?

251
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

252
- I think I'm dying. I really do.
- Oh, poor baby.

253
Tell my son that I love him.

254
Oh, excellent.
Okay, gotta have some more fun.

255
Ross, they are killing you out there.

256
- That's not true.
- She's right. You have to stop.

257
What? No. No, I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross.

258
Dude, you go back out there,
you're gonna be Dead Ross.

259
I don't care. I am not quitting.
I am gonna finish this game.

260
All right. If you insist on doing this,
at least let me help you.

261
God, no. That is no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything.

262
That's not what I was saying.

263
I just might know a few things
that could help you inflict some pain.

264
- I like that.
- Yeah? Listen closely.

265
- Devon has got a weak ankle.
- Huh?

266
One swift kick and he'll back off.

267
All right, bad ankle. Got it.

268
- And that big bloke with the beard?
- Uh-huh.

269
- He's got a trick hip.
- Ha, ha.

270
Yeah. And David over there,
I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.

271
Real...? I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.

272
And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.

273
You hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

274
But Liam's on my team.

275
- I don't care. You just get him.
- Go get him.

276
Okay. I am going back in.

277
Red Ross. Yeah.

278
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
What are these?

280
Oh, just some pictures I made
and hung up.

281
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
They do, don't you think?

282
- Aah!
- No, no, don't, don't.

283
Oh!

284
I know that there's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

285
Oh, my God. Look at this.

286
But there is a wire back there.
That switch is connected to something.

287
I don't care.
The wires have come loose in your head.

288
I thought if I could follow the wire,
I could find out what it did.

289
- And did you?
- No.

290
It disappears
back behind that baseboard.

291
For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.

292
But it didn't.

293
- Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
- Oh, my God.

294
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

295
Are you sure
you don't wanna go see a doctor?

296
Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.

297
This was great. I mean, I was great.
This was a great day.

298
You know what?
I'm buying everyone coffee.

299
Someone just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

300
- Yeah, sure.
- No, not you.

301
Okay.

302
Look, your eye's still popping out a little.
I'm gonna go get some ice.

303
- Okay.
- Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.

304
- You were amazing out there.
- Oh.

305
- I kind of was, wasn't I?
- Oh, my God.

306
I made a man twice my size cry.

307
I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4
and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

308
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

309
Please, are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

310
I gave a guy a bloody nose.

311
I mean, I'm not proud of it...

312
...but I really am.

313
And it's all because of you.

314
- Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you.
- I think you've got a concussion.

315
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.

316
You're welcome.

317
- I'm sorry. Did that hurt you?
- It's worth the pain.

318
You know what?
You know what? It's not.

319
This is the final
boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.

320
Well, I guess I gotta go.

321
Oh. My Bing-a-ling.

322
I'll wait for you.

323
Do you even know
how long you're gonna be gone?

324
Well, just until we find an energy source
to replace fuel.

325
Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.

326
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

327
Okay. Goodbye.

328
Goodbye.

329
- Chandler?
- No.

330
Chandler.

331
Janice. There you are. There you are.
I had to have one last kiss.

332
And also, also, you said you were
gonna leave right after I got on the plane.

333
No. No. I wanna see you take off.

334
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.

335
I'm going to Yemen.

336
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

337
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.

338
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

339
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.

340
- I officially give up.
- Thank God.

341
I guess Joey was right.

342
It does nothing.

343
See?

344
I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.

345
I lost it.

﻿1
What is it?

2
Nothing. I can't find anything
that I want to eat.

3
Everything makes me nauseous.

4
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.

5
No.

6
- Aw, honey, I'm sorry.
- God.

7
Ooh, what is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

8
Wow, pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

9
- Yeah.
- It's me. It's Phoebe.

10
Listen, there's something in here
I want to eat. What?

11
What smells so good?

12
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.

13
No.

14
- Ugh.
- Oh, wait, wait.

15
Is it my bologna sandwich?

16
Yes, yes, yes.

17
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants me to eat meat.

18
- I can't eat meat.
- Uh, wait, wait.

19
Maybe it's the pickle.

20
What are you writing?

21
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...

22
...and since I don't have the guts
to ask him out...

23
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

24
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh.

25
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

26
...never go out of style."

27
What did you throw away?

28
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, what have you guys been up to?

29
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian
doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.

30
Without me?

31
My uncle dragged us there,
but actually it turned out to be interesting.

32
- Yeah.
- They were so ornate and beautiful.

33
I mean, look at that.

34
I don't know how museums work
in England...

35
...but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

36
I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.

37
They have really lax security there.

38
It's a joke.

39
Bye.

40
Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you.
Bye-bye, then.

41
Bye.

42
Wow. Hey, you guys seem
to be having a good time.

43
Oh, yeah, she is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

44
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun.

45
I even signed up for helicopter classes.

46
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

47
- Aw, two days? You must be bummed.
- Yeah.

48
She's got to go back to London.

49
But you know what?
I've been prepared for this from the start.

50
We both knew we had two weeks
together and then that's it, you know?

51
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

52
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

53
Pheebs, hey.

54
- Hello, hello.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

55
So the baby is totally craving meat.

56
This afternoon, I tried tricking it.

57
I made it a soy burger
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

58
You know? And I got nauseous.

59
Well, maybe that's because
soy burgers suck.

60
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

61
Hey, but at least you got
that cool, pregnant-lady glow.

62
Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

63
- Okay.
- Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.

64
Oh, great. Great.

65
- Wow, yeah, it's comfortable.
- Yeah.

66
Man, you could really
flash somebody in this thing.

67
Ha, ha. They don't want you to put
your hands in the pockets...

68
...until you are out of the store.

69
Why not?

70
Well, because...

71
...we get a lot of...

72
You know, they ruin it for everybody.

73
I know.

74
You know, I wore that cashmere sweater
on a date last night.

75
- Oh.
- It was the first date since the divorce.

76
Well, congratulations.
So do you love her?

77
No, no, no. She's nice,
but, you know, it made me realize...

78
...I'm just not ready to be dating,
you know?

79
Huh.

80
Well, uh...

81
That's, uh... That's interesting.

82
Hey, whoa, hey.

83
- What was that?
- Oh, that's just an antitheft device.

84
Then what's this?

85
Well, you need that too, because
obviously a thief could just tear this up.

86
Listen, we have to have a party tonight.

87
We have to have one in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

88
- What?
- Yeah, what's going on?

89
We have to have a surprise
bon-voyage party for Emily.

90
But it's actually for Joshua.

91
Look, he said he's not ready to date.

92
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside work.

93
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

94
Well, as much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

95
...Emily and I aren't gonna be here,
all right?

96
She's gonna come by first
to say goodbye.

97
And then I've got a whole special
evening planned. So sorry. No party.

98
Aw.

99
- Hello?
- Surprise!

100
Surprise!

101
No one's ever thrown me
a surprise party before.

102
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

103
You're so sweet.

104
And I'm so surprised.

105
You really didn't know?

106
There's dancin'

107
Behind movie scenes

108
Why are you over here
if Joshua's all the way over there?

109
Uh, because I'm trying to play
hard-to-get.

110
Oh, quick. He's looking over here.
Say something funny.

111
- Like what?
- Ha-ha-ha.

112
What's so funny?

113
I said, "Like what?"

114
Now that's a thinker.

115
Okay, you know what? This
playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.

116
Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.

117
Okay.

118
- Hi.
- Hey.

119
- Care for a cherry?
- No, thanks.

120
You know, I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

121
You okay?

122
You all right?

123
So we should probably get going soon.

124
Oh, but the party's only
just getting started.

125
Yeah, but we have to be at The Four
Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.

126
And then, uh, you know,
then the Plaza for dinner.

127
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

128
No, no, no. Ha, ha.

129
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

130
It's usually, "Surprise!" Then,
"Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."

131
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

132
Your sister has just been telling me that
you used to dressed up like old ladies...

133
...and host make-believe tea parties.

134
Monica said that, did she?

135
Oh, yeah. Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

136
- A little salami.
- Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

137
Then, um, what goes on top
of the salami?

138
- Pastrami.
- Oh, yeah.

139
You're a genius.

140
Can someone give me a hand
with the zipper.

141
Up.

142
- You changed?
- Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.

143
- And "lucky" means "more cleavage"?
- Does for me.

144
Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.

145
I just want to go over there and grab him
and kiss him.

146
How could I kiss him
without letting him know that I like him?

147
Hey, I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

148
What?

149
- There was a scene in Footloose...
- Flashdance.

150
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl?
- She was a welder.

151
Were you, like, in the movie?

152
Anyway, she takes off her bra
under the shirt...

153
...and pulls it out the sleeve.

154
Very sexy. And classy.

155
Or if you wanna kiss him,
um, you could use mistletoe.

156
It's not Christmas.

157
- Or spin the bottle.
- And he's not 11.

158
Thank you so much for this.
It was really so thoughtful of you.

159
You're leaving?

160
- Yes, we have something we have to get to.
- Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.

161
No, you guys, you can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

162
We've got the whole big thing planned.

163
What big thing?

164
So, Spin-The-Bottle
works like this.

165
I spin the bottle.

166
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

167
All right.

168
Who wants to go first?

169
I'll go.

170
Welcome to America.

171
Oh.

172
All right.

173
Oh, my God.

174
Oh, my gosh. Two in a row.
You gotta use your tongues now.

175
All right.

176
What are the odds? What are the odds?

177
Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.

178
Let's let someone else play.

179
Hey, if you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

180
Okay, my turn.

181
Oh! Look at that.

182
Oh, my God.

183
Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.

184
It's okay, it's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again.

185
All right, well, everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

186
It was a bug.

187
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

188
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

189
Okay.

190
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.

191
Phoebe, what are you doing?

192
I can't help it.

193
I need the meat.
The baby needs the meat.

194
You know how when
you're dating someone...

195
...and you don't want to cheat on them
unless it's with someone really hot?

196
- Yeah, totally.
- All right, okay.

197
Well, this is the same kind of deal.

198
If you're gonna do something wrong...

199
...do it right.

200
Feel better?

201
Yeah, but at what cost?

202
Six more months, three meals a day?

203
I'm gonna eat like, you know,
millions of cows.

204
Hey, what if I said I could even things out
for you, meat-wise?

205
- What?
- Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?

206
- Yeah.
- But suppose, until the baby's born...

207
...I laid off it.

208
No extra animals would die.
You'd just be eating my animals.

209
Joey, I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

210
Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.

211
There's no meat in beer, right?

212
Okay, we can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers...

213
...and ask for our check right away.

214
We can't go now. Looks like Rachel
is going to put on a skit.

215
Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?

216
No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.

217
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

218
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

219
Rachel, wait, I can't let...

220
Actually, I kind of want to see
what happens.

221
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
Nice, uh, costume.

223
Oh, yeah.

224
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

225
So okay. Whoo!

226
Ready. Okay.

227
- Give me an "E."
- E.

228
- Give me an "M."
- M.

229
- Give me an "I."
- I.

230
- Give me an "L."
- L.

231
- Give me a "Y."
- Y.

232
What do you get?

233
Oh! Emily.

234
Whoo! Emily.

235
Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!

236
- You all right?
- I just loosened a tooth.

237
It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?

238
I'm gonna go put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

239
- What do I do now? What do I do now?
- I think you're done.

240
Okay, time to take off the bra.

241
Uh, that was really great.

242
But I got to take off, actually.

243
Take the bra off.

244
All right, come on,
let's go get your coat.

245
Okay.

246
Rachel's my girlfriend.

247
So this was really fun.

248
Oh, yeah, it was real fun.

249
You know, this bra...

250
...is really bothering me.

251
You know, this used to be my bedroom.

252
Yeah.

253
A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

254
If these walls could talk,
you know what they'd say?

255
"Want to hear some memories?"

256
Need a...? Need a little hand there?

257
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I got this all under control.

258
You really don't seem like you do.

259
God. Forget it! Oh, this is...

260
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

261
What was supposed to happen?

262
Can you not look at me when I say this?

263
I thought that if I could get you here...

264
...I could seduce you.

265
Uh, I don't wear suits to work...

266
...and I bought six of them from you.

267
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

268
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

269
- Why?
- Because I like you.

270
You like me?

271
Yeah.

272
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

273
A lot of this isn't, you know,
based on tonight.

274
But you like me?

275
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me.

276
Oh!

277
- But...
- No don't say "but."

278
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me."

279
Okay, uh...

280
- However...
- No, that's a fancy "but."

281
My marriage, like, just ended.

282
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

283
But...

284
I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

285
Okay.

286
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you before.

287
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

288
It's okay.

289
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

290
And, uh, it's too late to do
any of the stuff I had planned, so...

291
Ross.

292
I'm sorry.
I completely ruined your evening.

293
Ahem. Yeah.

294
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

295
Helps a little.

296
Is there a room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

297
Yeah, have a seat.

298
I'm so sorry.

299
It's okay.

300
I mean, it was just a two-week thing
anyway.

301
I just didn't want it to end this way,
you know.

302
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

303
What do you mean?

304
You seem to really like her.

305
Yeah, I really do.

306
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

307
We both agreed it was gonna be
a two-week thing.

308
You know? No commitment.

309
Ross?

310
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

311
...asking to hear stories about you...

312
...looking through
Monica's photo albums.

313
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

314
You think?

315
You've got, like, 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

316
And you're sitting here in a hallway...

317
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

318
- Hey, you're right.
- Yeah.

319
Thanks.

320
What photo album was it?

321
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

322
Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.

323
That was computer camp. Rach.

324
- Hey.
- Hey.

325
- You're a pathetic loser, right?
- Oh, yeah.

326
Sit.

327
Hi.

328
Oh, my God. Joshua.

329
Look.

330
All those things I said
about not being ready...

331
- They're not true?
- No, they're all true.

332
Oh.

333
But...

334
Oh.

335
Oh, I love that "but."

336
Um, do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

337
- Yeah.
- Okay.

338
Every time.

339
- Ooh, what do you got there?
- Pastrami.

340
Yeah.

341
- Hey, you know what goes good with that?
- Mm-hm. Corned beef.

342
Ooh, I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

343
- How about a little of that smoked turkey?
- Okay.

344
Oh, Mama.

345
- When is the baby due?
- Six months.

346
Hey, now, if a cow should die
of natural causes...

347
...I could have one of those, right?

348
Not if I get there first.

﻿1
Oh, man.

2
- What is that?
- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
What in the name of hell?

4
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
- Hey.
- Whoa.

6
Is this porn?

7
What did I do? I must have
hit something on the remote.

8
Do we pay for this?

9
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.

10
Maybe this is how they punish us.

11
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

12
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

13
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

14
Yeah, Joey just pressed something
on the remote and it just came on.

15
It happened to me once. I was flipping
through the channels and, bam.

16
- It was like finding money.
- Finding money with naked people on it.

17
Then I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

18
I never got it back again.

19
And I'm sad.

20
Why would he turn off the TV?

21
All right, you know what? Do we really
have to watch this while we eat?

22
No, no, no.

23
We don't know
what could make this go away.

24
Yeah, so no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

25
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

26
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

27
- I'm at least going to mute it.
- No, no, no.

28
- We still have porn.
- Yeah.

29
- Hi.
- Hey.

30
Honey, what are you doing?

31
- That's too heavy. Give it here.
- Yeah.

32
Oh, God.

33
Okay.

34
Ugh.

35
I'm getting too pregnant for this...
Lugging around a stupid massage table.

36
I have to find a job
where I carry a smaller table.

37
Or a job where you don't
have to carry a table.

38
You mean, like a doctor?

39
Pheebs, you're blocking the porn.
Look out.

40
Oh!

41
Oh, my.

42
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

43
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.

45
Aw. Why didn't you take her?

46
Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.

47
And you know, we said
our goodbyes this morning, so...

48
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

49
No.

50
Hey, cheer up.
You're gonna see her again, right?

51
Well, that's the thing. I don't know.

52
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her,
she said:

53
"This is so fantastic.
Why do we have to talk about the future?

54
- Let's enjoy..."
- Don't do the accent.

55
You've got to see her again.

56
Why do you care?

57
Because.

58
You could get to live out my fantasy.

59
You've had fantasies about Emily?

60
No. You know, the fantasy.

61
Meet someone from a strange land...

62
...fall madly in love
and spend the rest of your lives together.

63
Is that why, in junior high...

64
...you were the only one who hung out
with that Ukrainian kid?

65
Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

66
Do you love her?

67
We said it was only gonna be
two weeks, you know?

68
You love her.

69
What is love, really?

70
I knew you loved her.

71
You need to go to the airport
and tell her.

72
You're probably gonna catch her
just as she's about to go to the gate.

73
You're gonna call out her name
and yell, "I love you."

74
She's gonna say, "I love you too."

75
Then you guys are gonna have
the most amazing kiss.

76
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

77
I am a good kisser.

78
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.

79
Things will start to heat up.

80
And then a stewardess comes in...

81
I've been watching too much porn.

82
- Is that the heartbeat?
- That's it.

83
Oh, my God.

84
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

85
Have we talked about the possibility
of multiple births?

86
Why don't we just take care of this one?

87
And should I get pregnant again,
I'll hold onto your card, okay?

88
No, I'm getting three
separate heartbeats.

89
Three? You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

90
- Doctors are wrong all the time.
- Well...

91
Well, so are you sure
that there are three?

92
- Definitely.
- Oh, my God.

93
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha.

94
So in a few months...

95
...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies
just walking around inside me?

96
Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like
one of those log rides...

97
...when they just come shooting out.

98
Giving birth to three babies is not
that different than giving birth to one.

99
What do you know?

100
- Phoebe.
- Oh! Hi.

101
So how'd it go at the doctor's?

102
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

103
You know how, when you're,
um, walking down the street...

104
...and you see three people in a row.

105
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

106
- Yes.
- Okay.

107
Yeah, well, good news.
You're gonna have three babies. Aah!

108
- Three babies?
Uh-huh.

109
Oh, oh!

110
I've finally got my band.

111
We're gonna have a big family!
I always wanted a big family!

112
Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy.
I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.

113
- Oh.
- Why would we be freaked?

114
No, because maybe it's harder to raise them
and the added expense. Ugh!

115
- Oh.
- Right.

116
No, back to happy. Back to happy!

117
No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

118
...because, um...

119
Because I teach Home Ec.

120
And I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

121
You know, it'll be like
my very own little sweatshop.

122
You know, I've been thinking...

123
...ever since you said
that we're gonna have triplets.

124
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

125
- Frank.
- No, you can't quit college. No.

126
You're in college? Really?

127
- Yeah, refrigerator college.
- Yeah.

128
Yeah, you know, when we found out
we were gonna have a baby...

129
...I figured, you know,
I should have, like, a career, you know?

130
- And I love refrigerators.
- Yeah.

131
You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.

132
No, it's okay.
We're gonna have three kids.

133
And that's a different kind of dream.

134
Three kids and no money.

135
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.

136
Emily.

137
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

138
I just... I had to see you one more time
before you took off.

139
You are so sweet.

140
That's a big candy bar.

141
I had the most amazing time with you.

142
Me too.

143
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 009.

144
Well, that's me.

145
Here, have this.

146
I'm only allowed one piece
of carry-on anyway.

147
Wait, uh...

148
Listen, I have to tell you something.

149
I've been thinking.

150
I'm just going to come out and say it, okay?
Uh...

151
I think...

152
...I love you.

153
Oh.

154
Thank you.

155
It's no problem.

156
What is that song
that has been in my head all day?

157
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.

158
You know who doesn't even like
dirty movies?

159
- My new boyfriend Joshua.
- Yeah, right.

160
No, he told me he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

161
Oh, oh, yeah. Did he also say that he
thought some of the dialogue was corny?

162
And that he actually found it funny,
not sexy?

163
Yes.

164
Yeah, he likes porn.

165
Where you going?

166
I'm gonna find out if he really thinks
supermodels are too skinny.

167
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hi.

168
- Hi. Hey.
- How'd it go with Frank and Alice?

169
Frank has to quit college...

170
...because his super-fertile sister
is having three babies. Ugh.

171
I need to make a lot of money really fast.

172
And I had an idea
that I wanted to talk to you about...

173
...because you work for a big company.
Okay.

174
Insider trading.

175
What information is there
that you can give me?

176
Well, actually, they don't really talk to us
about that stuff.

177
I can get you some free White-Out,
though.

178
Huh! Did you do what I said?
Did you tell her?

179
- I did.
- And what did she say?

180
"Thank you."

181
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?

182
She said, "Thank you."

183
I said, "I love you."

184
And she said, "Thank you."

185
Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?

186
Yeah, what were you trying
to get her to do?

187
What do I do now?

188
You play hard-to-get.

189
She already lives in London.

190
So you go to Tokyo.

191
All right, look, forget it.

192
Okay, forget it.
You told her you love her. It's over.

193
It is not over. You're over.

194
What?

195
You know.

196
Okay.

197
Good one.

198
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.

199
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.

200
Now, you go home
and you wait for her call.

201
She could be calling you from the plane.
Come on, go.

202
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over.

203
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her,
you know, to see what's going on...

204
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

205
Then it's over.

206
Way to be strong, man.

207
- Hi.
- Hey.

208
Listen, can we watch cartoons
on your television?

209
We need a porn break.

210
We spent the last two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.

211
Well, so why don't you just turn it off?

212
Because then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

213
Oh, good, you're here.

214
Hey.

215
What you got there?

216
Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked.

217
Now, don't you hate it
when you have to cut a tin can...

218
...with an ordinary steak knife?

219
Ha.

220
Now, I know what you're thinking.

221
Pregnant woman slays four?

222
They didn't make you pay
for those knives, did they?

223
- No.
- Are you sure?

224
No.

225
You're not gonna make enough money
to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.

226
No, no. I know that.

227
But I just need to make enough money
for the second part of my plan.

228
- What's the second part of your plan?
- My Saturn dealership.

229
Hello?

230
Ross?

231
Emily. Hi.

232
Uh, how was your flight?

233
It was dreadful.

234
Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

235
No, no, that's all right. Um...

236
I'm just glad you called.

237
Ross, um, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

238
There's someone else.

239
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

240
She doesn't know
which one of us she wants.

241
Me or this "Colin" guy.

242
This isn't how it was supposed to go.
I mean, there can't be another guy.

243
Well...

244
Of course there's another guy.

245
Heh. This is even more perfect.

246
Now you have to prove your love.

247
I'm not proving anything, okay?
I'm done listening to you.

248
If I hadn't let you talk me
into going to the airport in the first place...

249
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

250
You put your fist through the wall?

251
No, I missed and hit the door.

252
But it opened really hard.

253
- You have to go to London.
- What?

254
Yep. You have to go fight for her.

255
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.

256
Because you already told her you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

257
Then she called you and told you
there was another guy.

258
So yeah. Go to London.
That will scare her.

259
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

260
I made fun of his accent.

261
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight at all. Am I right?

262
You want the same thing
to happen with Emily?

263
- No.
- All right, then.

264
Go fight for her. Go to London.

265
I mean, that could be you and Emily.

266
That, but nicer.

267
Just go to London.

268
- Really?
- Come on.

269
Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep.
Don't let her go without a fight.

270
- All right. All right. I'm going to do it.
- All right.

271
I'm gonna go to London,
and I am gonna fight for her.

272
Okay. Good luck.

273
Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...

274
...can you pick me up another one
of those Toblerone bars?

275
Oh, oh, I did it. I did it.
I figured out a way to make money.

276
I'm gonna open up my own massage place
and Frank's gonna help me.

277
And we can work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

278
La-la-la.

279
That sounds great.
But how can you afford it?

280
We were walking down the street...

281
...and we saw that van
you used for catering.

282
- And we realized...
- I'm telling it. I'm telling it.

283
Okay, you know how people
need transportation...

284
...but they also need massages to relax?

285
So I just figured we could combine the two.
Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.

286
I can fix up the van, bolt the table
in the back and you know what I've got?

287
A place that no one
will ever get out of alive?

288
No, think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

289
It's a Relaxi-Taxi.

290
The name was my favorite part.

291
- Well, I came up with it.
- You did not!

292
Oh!

293
No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

294
- Hello?
- Hey.

295
Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

296
No, because she hasn't come home yet.

297
And she hasn't been home all night.

298
She's obviously staying
with that other guy.

299
And I'm the stupid moron who spent
the whole night outside her apartment.

300
All right, when is the next flight out?

301
About four hours.

302
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours.
If she doesn't show up, come home.

303
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

304
And ask him if he thinks that is better
than Relaxi-Cab.

305
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

306
Ooh, that is better.

307
Are we in London?

308
Why are you doing here?
You can't be here.

309
I've come to talk to Ross.

310
What?

311
Nothing. No, nothing.

312
I was gonna call him...

313
Oh, you came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

314
I was right! I'm right, right?

315
I'd really rather talk to him.

316
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

317
And I need to talk to him.

318
So do you have any idea where he is?

319
Ross, are you there?

320
Ross, I don't know if you can hear this,
but I'm gonna talk anyway.

321
I'm in the States
with your sister and your friends.

322
And it's all over with Colin.

323
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you...

324
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want. Just take it.

325
I came here to tell you that I love you.

326
I love you too.

327
I'm gonna call you right now
from the phone booth.

328
You can't hear me.

329
I wish I could know
if you'd heard any of that.

330
I suppose I've either told you that I love you
or given my neighbors a good laugh.

331
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. This is none of your business.

332
Suppose there's not much chance
you did hear that.

333
And there's the call waiting...

334
...so I should go.

335
Oh, well.

336
Hello?

337
Hi.

338
Ross, I love you.

339
Oh.

340
Thank you.

341
- Hey.
- Hey.

342
I was just at the bank and there
was this really hot teller.

343
And she didn't ask me
to go do it with her in the vault.

344
Same kind of thing happened to me.

345
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

346
...gives me the pizza,
takes the money and leaves.

347
What, no "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

348
No, nothing.

349
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

350
I think you're right.

351
All right, ready?

352
- One.
- Two.

353
- Three.
- Three.

354
That's kind of nice.

355
- Yeah, that's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

356
- You want to see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

357
Free porn! We have free porn!

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey. Wow, it is true what they say:

2
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

3
Ha, ha.

4
Well, it's just I'm so pregnant
that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

5
So I thought, till I'm not,
I'm gonna play my songs on this drum.

6
It sounds really cool.

7
Listen, listen. Ahem. Okay.

8
Smelly cat, smelly cat

9
What are they feeding you?

10
Wow, Pheebs, that sounds great.

11
I know, I know! And I've only been playing
for, like, an hour.

12
- Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi.
- Hey.

13
What are you doing here?

14
Um, actually I came down
to ask you a big favor.

15
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep
more of your stuff in my uterus.

16
No, no, no. Okay. Now, see. Ahem.

17
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

18
And, um, Frank wants to name
one of the boy babies...

19
...Frank Jr., Jr.

20
Wouldn't that be Frank III?

21
Don't get me started.

22
Anyway, um,
since there are three babies...

23
...and, um, we both got
to put our names in...

24
...we would be truly honored
if you would name the other boy baby.

25
Oh, wow.

26
- That's so nice. Oh, oh!
- Ha, ha.

27
Cougar.

28
You think about it.

29
I left a bra drying on the shower rod.

30
You don't think your son
will think it's yours and be traumatized?

31
Hey, Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.

32
Oh, it's time to go.

33
Oh, no, no, no.
See, that clock's a little fast.

34
Uh, we still have 17 minutes.

35
Huh. What can we do in 17 minutes...

36
...twice?

37
Well, that's ambitious.

38
- Okay, you can ignore that.
- That's Carol with your son.

39
Uh, believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.

40
- Ross.
- I'll be right there.

41
- Hello. Hello. Hey.
- Hi.

42
Uh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.

43
- Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you.
- You too.

44
Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial
in London next week.

45
I'm so excited. I've never been there.

46
- Oh, well, I'll show you around.
- Great.

47
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
So if you can make any suggestions...

48
Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff.

49
- I'll go with you.
- Oh.

50
Oh, I'm sorry.

51
Oh. Look at you two bonding.

52
- Making us late for the airport so...
- Are you all right?

53
Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just
us getting along is difficult for him...

54
...because he doesn't like me.

55
Ha, ha. Come on. That's...

56
It's true.

57
- Hi.
- Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?

58
Ugh, no. It's so hard.

59
I went through this whole book
and found nothing.

60
I want a name that's really, like,
you know, strong and confident.

61
You know? Like Exxon.

62
Well, it certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.

63
Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?

64
No, I'm not sure about Hulk...

65
...but I like the idea
of a name starting with "The."

66
Well, you want a good name,
heh, go with Joey.

67
Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.

68
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey.

69
Know what?
If you're gonna name him Joey...

70
...you should name him Chandler.

71
Oh, come on, Chandler's funny,
he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...

72
...once you get to know him.

73
Hey, Joey's lovable too.

74
But the thing about Joey is,
if you need him, he'll be there.

75
Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, he might be a little late...

76
...but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you some cold soda...

77
...if what you need him for
is that you're really hot.

78
What do you say? What do you say?

79
Well, I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.

80
And Joey and Chandler
are both great names.

81
All right, I don't...

82
Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.

83
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it.
That's what I wanted to name my kid.

84
Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep
with Joshua for the first time tonight...

85
...which one of these
would you want to be wearing?

86
You know what? It really creeps me out
choosing other people's sex clothes.

87
Sorry. I'm just so excited.

88
I've been waiting for this for months.
I got my hair colored.

89
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.

90
What am I making him, by the way?

91
Well, you're making him a frisée salad
with goat cheese and pine nuts...

92
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.

93
I thought I was making him filet mignon.

94
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make
salmon because you had some left over.

95
And then you realized if you bitched
about it, then you would stop cooking...

96
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

97
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.

98
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
Hey.

100
So, uh, Emily called last night.

101
And now you're giving me the message?

102
Turns out that Emily
is just crazy about Susan.

103
Yeah.
They're going to the theater together.

104
They're going to dinner.

105
They're going horseback riding.

106
God, Susan is so fun.

107
Look, this is just a little too familiar.

108
Okay, for, like, six months
before Carol and I split up...

109
...all I heard was,
"My friend Susan is so smart.

110
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."

111
You actually think that something
could happen between Emily and Susan?

112
Hey, they're going to the gym together.

113
Two women...

114
...stretching.

115
You know, they take a steam together,
things get a little playful.

116
Didn't you see Personal Best?

117
No, but I'm gonna.

118
Hi. Hi. You're crazy.

119
Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.

120
How do you know?

121
I mean, we thought Carol was straight
before I married her.

122
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.

123
What a weird way to kick me
when I'm down.

124
No, no, I just meant for the baby.

125
Oh.

126
What's wrong with Ross?

127
It's just, you know, something like this...

128
...would never happen to The Hulk,
you know.

129
Actually, that's not true.

130
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72,
Dr. Bruce Banner found...

131
You know, never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.

132
So I decided I'm definitely gonna go
with either Joey or Chandler.

133
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, oh.

134
You gotta pick Joey.

135
I mean, name one famous person
named Chandler.

136
- Raymond Chandler.
- Someone you didn't make up.

137
Okay, there are no famous Joeys.
Except for, heh...

138
...Joey Buttafuoco.

139
- Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
- Yeah.

140
Well, how about a compromise then?
Okay, what if it's...

141
...you know, Chan-no-ey?

142
Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it.
He'll never be president.

143
I mean, there's never gonna be
a President Joey.

144
All right, look,
I didn't want to bring this up.

145
But Chandler is the stupidest name
I've heard in my life.

146
It's not even a name.
It's barely even a word.

147
Okay, it's kind of like chandelier
but it's not.

148
All right? It's a stupid, stupid,
non-name.

149
Wow.

150
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.

151
I'm sorry, man. I didn't... I'm sorry.

152
So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean...

153
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.

154
Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.

155
- So dig in.
- All right.

156
- Well, it all looks so good.
- Mm.

157
Mm.

158
Oh, my God.

159
Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so...

160
I am so good.

161
Behind you.

162
Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here,
and sometimes they migrate back over.

163
Is there, uh...? Is there some way
that they could, uh, not be here?

164
It's just that, uh, farm birds
really kind of freak me out.

165
- Yeah. Okay, okay.
- Okay, great.

166
Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.

167
- Whoa.
- Oh, sorry.

168
There you go.

169
Hey. How'd you do that?

170
Come on.

171
- All gone.
- Heh.

172
So, farm birds, huh?

173
Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.

174
And I would have told you about it
but I didn't know that they'd be here.

175
- Oh.
- So, uh, ahem.

176
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

177
So can I serve you a little...

178
What, what, what?

179
Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know
that they're still out there.

180
They're across the hall.
I mean, that's two doors away.

181
It's gonna take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.

182
That's not funny.

183
- Uh...
- Okay, you know...

184
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?

185
I mean, we could pack all this stuff up
and, you know, go to your apartment.

186
Oh, they're working on it this week.
It's a mess.

187
But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.

188
- Your parents'?
- They're out of town.

189
Oh.

190
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.

191
It'd be very, very romantic.

192
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that works.

193
They can smell the fear.

194
Hey.

195
How's Ben?

196
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat.
He said no.

197
I asked him if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.

198
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.

199
So he's sweeping.

200
Hey, buddy. Hey.

201
So, um, any word from Susan?

202
Ooh, yeah, she said she's having
so much fun with Emily.

203
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

204
Uh, by the by,
did it ever occur to you that...

205
...I don't know, maybe they might
be having a little too much fun?

206
What's too much fun?

207
You know, the kind of fun you
and Susan had when we were married.

208
Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.

209
- Am I?
- Yes.

210
Am I?

211
I can't speak for Emily...

212
...but Susan is in a loving,
committed relationship.

213
Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.

214
All right, just imagine for a moment...

215
...that Susan meets someone,
and they really hit it off.

216
Say they're coming back
from the theater...

217
...and they stop at a pub
for a couple of drinks.

218
They're laughing, you know.

219
Someone innocently touches
someone else.

220
There's electricity.

221
It's new. It's exciting.

222
Are you telling me
there isn't even the slightest possibility...

223
...of something happening?

224
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

225
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it.

226
None of the other kids believed me,
I swear to God, that duck pushed me.

227
Wow. This place is fabulous.

228
Yeah, let me show you around.
This is the downstairs living room.

229
There's two living rooms?

230
God, growing up here, this place
must have been a real babe magnet.

231
Yeah, well, it would have been,
but, uh, my parents just moved here.

232
Well, you should know this place
is a real babe magnet.

233
Want to make out?

234
You know, here's an idea.
Why don't I put the food in the fridge...

235
...and we can eat it later?

236
- That sounds like a plan.
- Heh.

237
Um, is there a place
that I could go freshen up?

238
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall
and, uh, second door to your left.

239
- Oh, hi, darling.
- Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?

240
- Oh, we cut the trip short.
- France sucks.

241
Um, this may be a little weird,
but I've got a date here.

242
Say no more.

243
We'll just grab some food, take it
with us upstairs and be out of your hair.

244
Oh, that'd be great.
So you didn't even get to Italy?

245
Yep. Sucks.

246
Hi, you.

247
Oh, my God.

248
I know. I can do more than cook.

249
Uh...

250
I like her. She seems smart.

251
Rachel, my parents.

252
So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.

253
Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

254
What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.

255
Okay, I work in fashion.

256
See, and this is a real dress, actually.

257
They're wearing it in Milan.

258
So part of my job is to wear the clothes
and then I see how people respond.

259
And then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's, so...

260
And obviously, in this case...

261
...I am going to report back:

262
"U.S.A. Not ready."

263
- Maybe in L.A.
- Yes.

264
- There you go.
- So have you kids eaten yet?

265
Well, ahem, we were going to do that after.
I mean, um...

266
- Next.
- Well, we're starving.

267
Why don't we just all
go get something to eat?

268
Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby
just lying around the house.

269
- So we'll go eat.
- Yeah.

270
You'll wear that.

271
We'll be eating and, of course,
you'll be wearing that.

272
Dude, I am sorry about what I said.

273
Nope, nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name.

274
- It's not that bad.
- Yes, it is.

275
From now on, I have no first name.

276
So you're just Bing?

277
I have no name.

278
So, what are we supposed to call you?

279
Okay, uh, for now, temporarily,
you can call me...

280
...Clint.

281
No way are you cool enough
to pull off "Clint."

282
Okay, so, what name am I
cool enough to pull off?

283
Um, Gene.

284
It's Clint. It's Clint.

285
- See you later, Gene.
- Bye, Gene.

286
It's Clint. Clint!

287
What's up with Gene?

288
- You wore your nightie to dinner?
- Oh, yeah.

289
And the best part though, was when
the waiter spilled water down my back.

290
I jumped up and my boob popped out.

291
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

292
Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.

293
So I just picked up
a message from Emily.

294
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.

295
- So?
- So?

296
Poetry?

297
Susan's gay.

298
They're being gay together.

299
- Emily's straight.
- Oh, wake up.

300
Wow.

301
Carol really messed you up.

302
Excuse me?

303
She turned you into this untrusting,
crazy, jealous sycophant.

304
All right, so I don't know what "sycophant"
means, but the rest is right.

305
I don't know what you're talking about.
I am not a crazy, jealous person.

306
Huh.

307
- What?
- She's totally right.

308
When we were together,
you got all freaked out about Mark...

309
...and there was nothing going on.
- This makes sense.

310
It does not.

311
Sure it does. In high school,
you weren't jealous at all...

312
...even though all your girlfriends
were cheating on you.

313
All right, so up until '92, '93,
he was very trusting.

314
Then '94 hit, Carol left him,
and bam. Paranoid City.

315
Yeah.

316
Absolutely, absolutely.

317
This is so much fun.

318
This is not fun.

319
Look, all we're trying to say is...

320
...don't let what happened with Carol
ruin what you've got with Emily.

321
The '92 Ross wouldn't.

322
I still think I was right
about that whole Mark thing, though.

323
Wha...? Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.

324
Drum roll.

325
Okay. Okay.

326
All right.

327
Help. Am I a Mark or a John?

328
Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.

329
But you might make a good Barney.

330
All right, look, I am serious.

331
Tomorrow at 3:30,
I'm going to the courthouse.

332
You're actually going through with this?

333
Hey, look, this name has been
holding me back my entire life.

334
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

335
So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

336
You've got problems because of you,
not your name.

337
This has got to stop.
Chandler is a great name.

338
In fact...

339
Yes.

340
I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

341
But... So I'm gonna name
the baby Chandler.

342
Really?

343
Yeah, but you have to
keep the name too.

344
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

345
- You want to hug it out?
- Yeah.

346
- Yay, yay. Oh, yay!
- Yay.

347
Okay, I'm gonna go tell
Frank and Alice right now.

348
Okay.

349
- Bye, Pheebs.
- Okay, bye.

350
- Ha, ha.
- Oh.

351
Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.

352
- Nice luggage.
- I was going to say.

353
- Hey.
- Hi.

354
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you too.

355
Thanks for everything, I had a great time.

356
Oh, so did I.

357
No tongue.

﻿1
Morning's here

2
The morning's here

3
Sunshine is here

4
The sky is clear

5
The morning's here

6
Hey!

7
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

8
Oh, come on!

9
Morning's here!

10
Morning's here

11
The morning's here

12
Sunshine is here

13
I hate this apartment!

14
I hate the color of these walls!
I hate that this place still smells like bird!

15
I hate that singing guy!

16
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

17
Morning's here, morning is...

18
Stop it!

19
I will kill you.

20
I hate that my room is so small.

21
I have all the space I need.
Just do what I did.

22
Monica, you don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

23
You know what?
I am tired of your bellyaching.

24
I've worked really hard at making this
a nice place for us to live.

25
I know. I'm so sorry.

26
I'm sorry, okay?

27
This is a great apartment.

28
Shut up. This place is a hole.

29
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

30
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

31
He does that?

32
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Ha, ha.

33
Well, I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

34
- Oh, I know.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35
You know what?

36
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

37
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...

38
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

39
I mean, I love you too. A lot.

40
But that guy!

41
I love that guy!

42
- I love both of you.
- Ah, heh.

43
I wish I didn't have to go.

44
Then don't.

45
Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.

46
- Just one more day.
- Oh, Ross.

47
- One more day.
- Please don't do this to me again.

48
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

49
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

50
I wish I could.

51
Oh, no, don't... Don't...
Don't start packing.

52
Come on.

53
I don't think you understand packing.

54
I don't want to leave it
till the last minute.

55
Last time I packed in a rush,
I left my knickers here.

56
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

57
You didn't!

58
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

59
Hello.

60
Ho, ho, ho.

61
- Excuse me?
- Your pants.

62
Oh, yeah! You like them?

63
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

64
These are so comfortable.

65
Uh, Pheebs, those are,
uh, Santa pants.

66
- What?
- Santa pants.

67
Santa Claus' pants.

68
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.

69
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

70
These names are good,
and these are bad.

71
Oh.

72
- Hey!
- Hey.

73
Hey, Pheebs.

74
So, how are the elves?

75
I don't know.
How are the, uh, you know?

76
Your clothes aren't funny.

77
Hey, guys,
what should I wear to a Knicks game?

78
Uh, a T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

79
You have tickets?

80
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

81
Apparently, they're good seats.

82
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

83
Do you guys want these?

84
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we do!

85
Well, you got them!

86
- All right!
- Just give us our apartment back.

87
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.

88
Are you serious?

89
Come on. We know what these are worth.

90
Do you think we're stupid?

91
Not stupid. You're meaner
than I thought.

92
- What do you say?
- Forget it.

93
Okay? I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

94
Your "bachelor pad"?

95
Have you even had a girl here?

96
No.

97
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning time.

98
Yeah, you do.

99
Come on!

100
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

101
Good one.

102
Come on. Season tickets.

103
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

104
Forget it.
I'm not giving up the apartment.

105
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

106
...to the Number 1 salesman every year.
All right? My dad never won.

107
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

108
- Hey guys!
- Hey.

109
Oh, my God.

110
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

111
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.

112
You do know that Wham broke up?

113
Ah! Ha, ha.

114
I like it. And Emily likes it.
And that's what counts.

115
So, uh, how are you guys doing?

116
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

117
Where's Emily?

118
Ugh, she's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

119
- Didn't she, like, just get here?
- Yeah! Yeah.

120
Easy, tiger.

121
I just hate this so much.

122
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

123
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

124
- So, what'll you do?
- There's nothing to do.

125
She lives there. I live here.

126
She'd have to move here.

127
She should move here.

128
What?

129
- I can ask her to live with me.
- Are you serious?

130
- Why not? I mean, why not?
- You've only known her six weeks!

131
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

132
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

133
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.

134
I mean, I love her, you know?

135
And I love the milk!

136
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

137
Joey, you say things now.

138
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

139
She's great!

140
But this is too soon.
You're only gonna scare her.

141
- I don't wanna do that.
- No.

142
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

143
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

144
I'm not going to do it.

145
- Thanks guys.
- No problem.

146
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

147
It's too hard. Too hard!

148
All right, boys.
Last chance for the tickets.

149
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

150
No, thank you.

151
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

152
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

153
I want those seats as much as you.
But we can't live in the small apartment...

154
...after we've lived here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

155
Yes.

156
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

157
No, I didn't read yours!

158
We can go to the game tonight!

159
The only way I'll consider this...

160
...is if they offer more
than just season seats.

161
- It's the Knicks!
- Screw the Knicks.

162
Whoa!

163
I didn't mean that. I just meant...

164
...that the apartment is worth
so much more.

165
Huh.

166
And the Knicks rule all.

167
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

168
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?

169
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

170
All right, look.

171
What if you could keep the apartment
and the tickets?

172
Done!

173
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.

174
Ooh, we could get nothing.

175
- Or you can end up with everything.
- Oh, I like that.

176
What do you say?

177
- No!
- Just do it!

178
Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!

179
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.

180
Because you're my best friend.

181
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.

182
I'm in.

183
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?

184
Okay. Well, we should
let Phoebe decide...

185
...because she's the only one
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

186
Okay. Ha, ha. Um...

187
Ooh, ooh. Oh, I have a game!

188
- This is great!
- Okay. What's the game?

189
Um, well, it doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

190
No, it doesn't have a name. Um...

191
Okay, Monica.

192
What is your favorite thing
about trees?

193
- They're green?
- Good! Good, five points!

194
All right, Joey...

195
Same question.

196
Uh...

197
- Oh! Heh. They're tall.
- Ooh, three points.

198
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.

199
That's not even a game.

200
Shut up. We're winning!

201
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.

202
High card wins.
What do you say?

203
- Let's do it!
- Oh, I have cards!

204
- Oh, good.
- Yeah. Here.

205
No, these are the trick deck.

206
Okay. Here, yes.

207
- Ahem.
- Okay.

208
Okay, you guys, uh, you pick first.

209
- Okay.
- Okay?

210
- Four.
- That's a low one!

211
Okay.

212
Phoebe, you look. I can't do it.

213
- What makes you think I can?
- That's okay.

214
Ace!

215
Why are you hugging?

216
Because we won our apartment back!

217
What? Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!

218
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!

219
I don't know.

220
Ooh! Oh.

221
Look it! Aah!

222
- All right, come on, pick again!
- Okay, give me.

223
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!

225
Aah! I know queen is high!

226
Not as high as...

227
It worked! King!

228
We pick again!
We pick again!

229
- Why?
- I don't know.

230
- Tickets, please.
- Ugh!

231
- That's courtside, baby!
- Yeah, ha, ha.

232
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.

233
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.

234
No, they didn't.

235
Hey.

236
Packed while you were gone.

237
I left some knickers under your pillow.

238
Move in with me.

239
What?

240
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
and people will say it's too soon...

241
...but just think.
Think how great it would be.

242
Oh...

243
I don't know.

244
Uh, oh, leaving London.

245
- My whole family lives there...
- I know.

246
- My job.
- You'll get a job here.

247
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.

248
That could be you.

249
Yeah, but it's my whole life.

250
You come to England.

251
I can't. I would. I really would.
But my son is here.

252
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?

253
Oh, I don't think so.

254
It would be different if it was
way into the future...

255
...and we were getting married
or something.

256
What?

257
Uh, no, right.
I shouldn't have said "married."

258
Uh, please don't go freaky on me.

259
I didn't mean it.
I didn't say it. I take it back.

260
No. Don't.

261
Why don't we?

262
Why don't we what?

263
Get married.

264
You are mad!

265
No, I'm not! It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.

266
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.

267
- We've known each other six weeks!
- Yeah, I know.

268
So what? Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?

269
Look. I was with Carol for
four years before we got married...

270
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.

271
I mean, this...

272
This makes sense for us.

273
Come on. Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

274
I mean, last night
I got my ear pierced. Me!

275
This feels right.

276
Doesn't it?

277
My parents are gonna be really mad.

278
Is that...? Are you saying "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?

279
Yes.

280
- Yes!
- Yes?

281
- We're getting married!
- Oh, my God!

282
- Yes! Ha, ha.
- We're getting married!

283
Come here, come here.

284
Ow!

285
Emily, will you marry me?

286
Yes.

287
Oh, it's a bit small.

288
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.

289
It was.

290
- Those were, like, the best seats ever.
- Oh, yeah.

291
Hey, should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?

292
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.

293
Oh, God.

294
Hey, you want a beer?

295
- Whoa!
- I know!

296
Open up! Open up! Open up!

297
We'll discuss it in the morning.

298
What the hell is going on?

299
We took our apartment back!

300
I had nothing to do with it.

301
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.

302
Oh, oh!

303
We are switching back right now.

304
No, we're not. We're not leaving!

305
You'll have to. You both have jobs.

306
As soon as you do, we're switching back!
There's nothing you can do to stop us.

307
Right, Joe?

308
I don't know.

309
What?

310
I don't want to move again, with...

311
I don't care! This is our apartment
and they stole...

312
You stole!

313
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square. Twice!

314
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!

315
All right.

316
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.

317
Oh, no more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!

318
- Let us keep the apartment and...
- As a thank you...

319
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.

320
- Totally worth it.
- That was one good minute.

321
- Good night.
- Good night.

322
- Men are such idiots.
- I know.

323
Can you believe something that stupid
actually got us our apartment back?

324
It's funny. If you had just done that
after the last contest...

325
...no one would have
had to move at all. Ha, ha.

326
- Let's pretend that's not true.
- Yeah.

327
Okay. Scarf's done.

328
- Come on. Come on, come on!
- Okay.

329
- Hey!
- Hey.

330
What's going on?

331
Ross has some big thing
to tell everyone.

332
Uh...

333
Well, okay. It's, uh... Ahem.

334
Emily and I, we decided to, uh...

335
...to get married.

336
- What?
- Oh, my God.

337
Oh, are you pregnant too?

338
No.

339
When did...? How did you...?

340
We just decided to go for it.

341
We know it's a bit hasty, but, uh...

342
...it just feels so right.

343
Um, I was just telling the guys...

344
Yeah, I heard.

345
I think it's great! Aah!

346
I'm so happy for you!

347
Well, yeah! Congratulations!

348
- I can't believe you're getting married!
- Yeah.

349
Monica and Rachel made out.

350
Morning's here

351
The morning's here

352
Sunshine is here

353
The sky is clear

354
The morning's here

355
- Hey, you're back!
- Hey!

356
- Get into gear
- Breakfast is near

357
The dark of night has disappeared

358
- I'll see you tomorrow morning!
- Okay!

﻿1
Wow. That ripped.

2
That ripped real nice.

3
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

4
You know? Turn and slide.

5
No, you don't turn and slide.

6
You throw it out.

7
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot
every time I get dressed.

8
Well, we're not throwing it out.
I built this thing with my own hands.

9
All right.

10
How about we sell it?

11
All right.

12
But you're gonna have to tell them.

13
You mind if we stick you in a different
cabinet? They seem all right with it.

14
Monica, it's Chip.
- Yes.

15
- Who's Chip?
- Shh.

16
It was good running into you today.

17
So, uh, here's my number. 555-9323.
Give me a call. Later.

18
Chip is Chip Matthews.

19
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

20
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

21
Monica, you're so lucky.
He's, like, the most popular guy in school.

22
I know.

23
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

24
Okay.

25
Okay. Goodbye.

26
Oh, my God.
We just had the best conversation.

27
- I was just leaving.
- Good.

28
Because I've got a product report
to read.

29
It's, like, eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

30
Why? Did you write it?

31
Whoa.

32
Look at that.

33
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

34
Well, uh, actually...

35
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

36
Well, um...

37
Why don't you give him a call?

38
Okay.

39
- Are you sure you want to hear this?
- Oh, I'm sure.

40
Chip. Hi, it's Rachel.

41
Rachel Green.

42
Yeah. Um, you left me a message?

43
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

44
Monica Geller?

45
Oh.

46
Oh, that's right.

47
He called to ask out Monica.

48
That's got to be embarrassing.

49
Dumb drunken bitch

50
Thank you. Thanks. Ha, ha.

51
Now here's a question.

52
Where'd you guys get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

53
Uh-uh. First you tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in all the land.

54
I'm reading your ad.

55
- Looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

56
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...

57
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

58
Oh, my God. You guys are selling
the entertainment center?

59
- Why? I love that thing.
- You want it?

60
- Oh, no.
- No.

61
Uh, Gepetto?

62
Five thousand dollars?

63
Are you insane?

64
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks.

65
All right, look, I'm changing it to $50
or your best offer.

66
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

67
No.

68
Oh.

69
What do you do?

70
I can't believe you don't know
what I do for a living.

71
- I actually don't know.
- Yeah, something to do with numbers?

72
Oh, my God, no. Shoo, kitty. No.

73
No, no. Shoo. Come on, you. Come on.

74
Crazy.

75
- Oh, my God.
- What?

76
Nothing. Nothing.

77
What? What's wrong?

78
I just...

79
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

80
You mean, the mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

81
No. No, no. She was a human lady.

82
This is the spirit of my mom, Lily.
The one that killed herself.

83
Are you sure she's in the cat?

84
Or have you been taking your grandma's
glaucoma medicine again?

85
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

86
I'm sure. First of all,
okay, there's the feeling.

87
Okay, and for another, how about the fact
that she went into my guitar case...

88
...which is lined with orange felt.

89
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

90
Cats like fish.

91
Hi, Mommy.

92
Oh. I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.

93
- Dude, Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of...
- Let it go.

94
Hey.

95
Um, when were you gonna tell me
that you're going out with Chip Matthews?

96
Now?

97
- Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
- No. It's not okay.

98
I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

99
What, that thing at the prom?

100
Monica, I couldn't find him for two hours.
He was having sex with Amy Welsh.

101
Come on, that was back in high school.
How could that still bother you?

102
I mean, why of all people
do you have to go out with Chip?

103
Look, you and I went to different schools.

104
Okay, that doesn't help because
we went to the same high school.

105
You went to one
where you were popular.

106
And you got to ride off
on Chip's motorcycle...

107
...and wear his letterman jacket.

108
I went to one where I wore a band uniform
that you had to have specially made.

109
They had to have that specially made?

110
It was a project
for one of the Home Ec. Classes.

111
Oh, my God.
They told us that was for the mascot.

112
Back then I thought
that I'd never, ever get the chance...

113
...to go out with a Chip Matthews.

114
And now he's called me up
and asked me out.

115
And the fat girl inside of me
really wants to go. I owe her this.

116
I never let her eat.

117
- Oh, you go out with him.
- Oh, really?

118
Yeah.

119
If it's possible,
could you leave him somewhere...

120
...and go have sex with another guy?

121
I'll try.

122
So you guys having any luck
getting rid of the entertainment center?

123
There were a couple calls last night...

124
...but, uh, I don't think any of them
are gonna work out.

125
Yes, Joey has a very careful
screening process.

126
Apparently not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

127
Stop it. Stop it.

128
She keeps squirming
and trying to get away.

129
Just like when she was alive.

130
So, Pheebs, how long is your mom
gonna be with us?

131
Well, I'm not sure.

132
I mean, I guess until she, you know,
gets used to the fact that there's...

133
...you know, a new mom.

134
You know, I think she's worried
that she's gonna be replaced.

135
Well, that's not gonna happen, is it? No.

136
Okay, I have to return a call
in the other room.

137
Why can't you use the phone in here?

138
Well, I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

139
I just spelled the wrong word.

140
So, guys, am I crazy or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

141
- Ross, don't start.
- Come on.

142
You can't tell me you actually believe
that there's a woman inside that cat?

143
I believe it.

144
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

145
No, you...

146
You know what?

147
You're not gonna suck me into this.

148
Oh, sure I am.
Because you always have to be right.

149
I do not always have... Okay, okay.

150
Jurassic Park could happen.

151
Wow. That's, uh... That's pretty nice.

152
"Pretty nice"?

153
You'll have to pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

154
We don't have 50 bucks.
But would you be willing to trade for it?

155
We got a canoe.

156
You know,
I really don't think we need a canoe.

157
You gotta take the canoe.

158
All right, just...

159
Just take the entertainment center.

160
And then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

161
We're not throwing it away.
I built that canoe.

162
Good for you.

163
You guys, you're never gonna believe
what I just found on a telephone pole.

164
Looks kind of familiar?

165
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name Julio.

166
You guys, there's a little girl
in SoHo looking for this cat.

167
- I mean, you know what that means?
- Yeah, 200-dollar reward split five ways.

168
Do we have to tell her?

169
- Yes, we have to tell her.
- Oh, but it's made her so happy.

170
Little girl misses her cat.

171
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.

172
Okay, ha, ha, you know what?
I have to go have dinner with my son.

173
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

174
Yeah.

175
Thank you.

176
Ugh. I hate it when Ross is right.

177
- He is right, isn't he?
- You know what?

178
This might be one of the times
when he's wrong.

179
- You think?
- Oh, no, he's right.

180
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

181
Uh, Pheebs, ahem...

182
- About your mom, heh.
- Yeah?

183
How's that going?

184
So great.
Oh, we took a nap together today.

185
My mom fell asleep on my tummy
and purred.

186
That's so sweet.

187
I'm gonna get some coffee.

188
Huh? What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

189
- Pheebs...
- I just feel so...

190
- All right.
- I'm coming already.

191
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

192
- Hello, Chip.
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

193
I'm great. I'm great.

194
Got a great job at Bloomingdale's.
I have wonderful friends.

195
And even though I'm not
seeing anyone right now...

196
...I've really never felt better
about myself.

197
So, uh, Monica ready yet?

198
She'll be out in a second.

199
So, Chip, how's, um, Amy Welsh?

200
Amy Welsh?
Wow, I haven't seen her since...

201
So, Monica about ready?

202
This is the unit for you, my friend.

203
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage compartments.

204
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

205
What?

206
Oh, yeah, I got in there myself once.

207
My roommate bet me 5 bucks
that I couldn't.

208
And then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

209
Ha, ha. Yeah.

210
It was funny till I started feeling
like I was in a coffin.

211
No, you... You can't fit in that thing.
That's not deep enough.

212
Oh, yeah?

213
If I can't...

214
...I'll knock 5 bucks off the price
of the unit.

215
- All right, you have yourself a deal.
- Okay.

216
See? I told you.

217
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

218
Hey, a nickel.

219
Here we are.

220
Oh, my God, you still have the Chipper.

221
The what?

222
That's what we used to call
your, uh, motorcycle in high school.

223
You know, a motorcycle's a chopper.

224
And you're Chip.

225
Never mind.

226
No, I think it's cute.

227
Wow.

228
A lipper from the Chipper.

229
So are you still in touch
with anyone from high school?

230
Um, there's Rachel...

231
...and that's it. How about you?

232
Oh, yeah, I still hang
with Simens and Zana.

233
You know, and I see Spindler a lot,
and Levine, Kelly.

234
And I run into Goldie
from time to time...

235
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

236
...J.T., Beardsley.

237
Is that all?

238
Ah, you know, after high school,
you just kind of lose touch.

239
Oh, yeah, I ran into Richard Dorfman.

240
- Oh, how is he?
- Not so good.

241
Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Ha-ha-ha.

242
- Isn't he an architect now?
- Yeah, they still wear underwear.

243
Oh, my God.

244
What?

245
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

246
What happened?

247
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs.

248
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in there?

249
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

250
Well, this guy came by
to look at the unit...

251
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

252
So you got in voluntarily?

253
I was trying to make a sale.

254
Oh, man. If I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

255
Bend over?

256
And then Zana just let one rip.

257
Look, not that I don't enjoy talking about
people who we went to high school with...

258
- ...because I do.
- Ha, ha.

259
But, um, maybe we can talk
about something else.

260
Like you.
I don't even know where you work.

261
- You know where I work.
- I do?

262
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

263
- You still work at the Multiplex?
- Like I'd give up that job. Ha, ha.

264
Free popcorn and candy
any time I want?

265
- I can get you free posters for your room.
- Thanks, I'm set.

266
Do you live with your parents?

267
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

268
Wow, they really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

269
Yeah, your microwave, the stereo.

270
Oh, man, he took the five of spades.

271
Oh, no, no, here it is.

272
Oh, my God. What happened?

273
Oh. Um, Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed.

274
So how was your date?

275
Well, you know how I always wanted
to go out with Chip in high school?

276
Well, tonight, I actually went out
with Chip Matthews in high school.

277
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

278
No, it's okay. Not only did I get
to go out with Chip Matthews...

279
...I got to dump Chip Matthews.

280
- Oh, that's so great.
- I know.

281
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
So, uh,
what did the insurance company say?

283
Oh, they said, uh:

284
"You don't have insurance here,
so stop calling us."

285
You didn't tell her?

286
Okay, fine.

287
- Pheebs?
- Yeah. Hi.

288
Hi. Listen, uh...

289
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

290
All right?
There are flyers all over the place.

291
I'm sorry, sweetie.

292
Hey, we can take her
back with you if you want.

293
Oh. Mm-hm.

294
But, you know, she chose to find me.

295
I mean, I have to respect her decision,
right?

296
- That's a good call.
- That's right.

297
No, no. Hey, enough is enough.

298
Look, I'm sorry
that you feel guilty or whatever...

299
...about spending time with your new mom.
But this is not your old mom.

300
This is a cat. Okay?

301
Julio the cat.

302
Not Mom. Cat.

303
It's okay.

304
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

305
None.

306
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like
when one of them comes back. Do you?

307
I believe this is my mother.

308
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

309
Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.

310
I'm sorry.

311
Okay.

312
I don't know what to say. Heh.

313
You could say you're sorry to her mom.

314
I think she would like that.

315
Come here. Here, come here, come here.

316
Mrs. Buffay?

317
Sorry about what I said.

318
Um, it was insensitive of me to say...

319
...that you were just a cat.

320
When, clearly, you are also
the reincarnated spirit...

321
...of my friend's mother.

322
Thank you.

323
- We both forgive you.
- Heh.

324
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

325
Yeah. Okay, listen.

326
Um, Mom, I hope you know
that you still mean a lot to me.

327
And you're welcome
to come back any time.

328
Pheebs?

329
If she could come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

330
Come on, Mom,
I'm gonna take you home.

331
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

332
Oh, uh, you know, I got an extra futon.

333
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.

﻿1
Are you kidding me?

2
Joey?

3
Joey? Joey, Joey, Joey,
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey!

4
Joey. Joey. Joey.

5
Joey, Joey!

6
Yeah.

7
Oh. Oh, did I wake you?

8
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?

9
So, uh, what do you do when
you're not working here?

10
- You don't need to fill these silences.
- Okay, thanks.

11
Chandler, that's your fourth cup of coffee.

12
I'm drinking lots because I'm exhausted
because Joey started snoring.

13
He's in a different room. He's that loud?

14
Oh, you should hear me.

15
It's not something to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.

16
I told you, I'm not going to any clinic.

17
I don't have a problem.
You're the one with the problem.

18
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

19
- They don't have those.
- Yeah, they do.

20
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!

21
There, you just had your first class.

22
I used to go out with this guy
that was a light sleeper.

23
And whenever I'd snore,
he'd roll me over...

24
Oh, yeah.

25
He'd roll me over,
and I'd stop snoring.

26
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!

27
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

28
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

29
Oh, the Olympics!

30
- Have you picked a date?
- Huh? Oh.

31
No. Not yet.

32
I still can not believe you're engaged.

33
Just because it's happening so fast.
Not because you're a loser.

34
Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?

35
Mm, she's upstairs not doing the dishes.

36
And I'll tell you,
I'm not doing them this time.

37
I don't care if those dishes
sit until they're covered...

38
I'll do them when I get home.

39
Yeah. Oh, hey.

40
Um, Emily found this
wedding dress in London...

41
- Already?
- Yeah, but it didn't fit.

42
Luckily, there's a store here
with one left in her size.

43
But I'm the groom...

44
- I'll pick it up for you.
- Thank you.

45
She's got you running errands,
picking up wedding dresses...

46
Ha-ha-ha. Wah-pah!

47
What's "wah-pah"?

48
You know. Whipped.

49
Wah-pah!

50
That's not whipped. Whipped is:

51
That's what I did.

52
Wah-pah!

53
You can't do anything!

54
Hey, Mon.

55
- I was just doing these dishes. Oh...
- Hey.

56
- Hi.
- Do you, uh, have a minute?

57
Yeah, I was just about to
take a break anyway.

58
So listen, uh...

59
...I know you and I haven't
had a chance to talk...

60
...since, uh, Emily and I
decided to get married.

61
And I was just wondering
how you were.

62
Ahem. Oh.

63
If you were getting married,
heh, I would feel kind of...

64
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

65
It def... Uh, it definitely took me
by surprise. But, you know...

66
...uh, I'm okay.

67
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
I just wanted to check.

69
Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.
Oh, ha, ha.

70
- You're great.
- Hmm.

71
And I know someday this will
happen for you too.

72
- You just hang in there.
- Ahem.

73
Uh, heh.

74
"Hang in there"?

75
Oh, no, I didn't mean...

76
You haven't heard of a serious
relationship called "me and Joshua"?

77
Oh. I thought you had
just been on four dates.

78
I didn't realize that had
become anything.

79
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it has become.

80
Yeah. Oh, no,
those were four great dates.

81
- Oh. Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

82
I mean, and the connection!
I mean, you know.

83
Emotionally, mentally. You know?

84
Physically.

85
- Wow. That's incredible.
- I know, isn't it?

86
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.

87
And it's kind of like it's a tie.

88
I gotta get back to my dishes.

89
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, yeah.

90
You know what would
make me happy?

91
Oh, yeah, no, what's that?

92
If the four of us could all,
you know, hang out together.

93
Emily's coming into
town this weekend.

94
Why don't, uh, we all
have dinner Sunday night?

95
- That would be great!
- Yeah?

96
- All right. It's a date!
- Right. Yeah.

97
"Hang in there." You hang in there.

98
- Did you say something?
- No, just singing.

99
Oh, my God!

100
Oh, look at this one!

101
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah. Oof.

102
About half of these will
end up getting divorced.

103
May I help you ladies?

104
Yes, um, I'm here to pick up
a dress on hold.

105
What's the name?

106
- Emily Waltham.
- Oh, yes, I have it right here.

107
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?

108
Okay.

109
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

110
I am, aren't I?

111
Miss Waltham?

112
- Yes?
- We're closing.

113
All right.

114
And could I get my ring back?

115
All right, buddy. Time to roll over.

116
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

117
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!

118
And a pajama store!

119
Does she use the cups?

120
Yes, I believe she does.

121
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!

122
Hmm.

123
Thank you. Heh.

124
Aw.

125
Thank you very much.

126
Oh, thank you for coming.

127
- Uh, just a second.
- No, no! Let me in!

128
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

129
- Can you hold on a minute?
- No!

130
You have to let me in right now!

131
- Are you alone?
- Yes!

132
All right.

133
This sucks.

134
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.

135
I'm so tired.

136
It's 6:00.

137
- Hi.
- Hey.

138
I hear you and Joshua
are going out with Ross and Emily.

139
And I think... I think that's really cool.

140
Yeah, I think you're handling
that really well.

141
"Handling it"?

142
What do you mean?
There's nothing to handle.

143
Maybe I'd have a problem with this
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

144
- They're not gonna get married anyway.
- What?

145
Come on. They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!

146
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?

147
Somewhere, one of them is gonna
realize what they've done...

148
...and call the thing off.

149
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.

150
You know, I don't dance at weddings.

151
- Why not?
- Weddings are a great place to meet women.

152
When I dance, I look like this.

153
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

154
So, what are you guys doing
four weeks from today?

155
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

156
I am...

157
...free.

158
Great, because we're getting
married in a month.

159
- What?
- Yup.

160
- In a month?
- Yeah.

161
- You mean 30 days?
- Yeah.

162
- From now?
- Yeah.

163
- That's great!
- Yeah, ha, ha.

164
Emily always wanted to get married
in this place her parents got married...

165
...but it's gonna be torn down, so...

166
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...

167
...and it just feels right, you know?

168
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!

169
This isn't mine.

170
- Ahem
- Hey, Rachel.

171
Hi.

172
- What's up?
- Oh, heh.

173
Your voice sounded
all squeaky on the phone.

174
Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see you.

175
See you and hug you.

176
Ha, ha. See you, heh.

177
- Great.
- Yeah!

178
Sit.

179
You okay?

180
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.

181
Want to know why?

182
Do I?

183
Because I am really happy about us.

184
I think we are so on the right track.

185
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.

186
- You know?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

187
- We're... We're clicking.
- Yeah.

188
If there was just one little area...

189
...where I think we need to work on,
I would think...

190
...it's that we're
just not crazy enough.

191
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.

192
Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.

193
I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?

194
But, uh...

195
We ju... I mean, like crazy! You know?

196
Okay. All right.

197
This is going to sound,
you know, a little, um, hasty.

198
But, uh, just go with me.

199
What if we got married?

200
Aah? Heh.

201
- What?
- Oh, I know. It's so totally like:

202
"Whoa, can we do this?" You know?
I mean...

203
But it just feels right.
Don't you think? It does.

204
I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?

205
Wow. Uh...

206
Rachel, um...

207
...you're...

208
...a real...

209
...special lady.

210
But my divorce isn't final yet...

211
...and we've been on four dates.

212
So I'm thinking no...

213
...but...

214
...thanks.

215
You idiot!

216
- Your name, please?
- Joey Tribbiani.

217
Mm-hm. Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?

218
Uh, sir?

219
Yes, he did.

220
All right. We'll call you
in a few minutes.

221
Whoa. Hey.

222
Check out that girl.
She is really hot.

223
Yeah, she is.

224
Wow.

225
How you doing?

226
- What?
- You're coming on to the entire room.

227
- I'm Chandler. Hi.
- I'm Marjorie. Hi.

228
- Do you mind if I sit?
- No, please.

229
So, uh, what are you in for?

230
I talk in my sleep.

231
What a coincidence.
I listen in my sleep.

232
So why don't you
give me your number?

233
- Are you ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

234
I got it! Mine! Aah!

235
- Congratulations!
- Thank you! Ha-ha-ha.

236
- Okay, my turn, my turn!
- Okay!

237
Okay, ready?

238
Okay.

239
That was a terrible throw!

240
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.

241
Look at me. My big concern
is what's real?

242
Oh, my God.

243
We're really sad, aren't we?

244
Yeah, I think we are.

245
This isn't even my dress.

246
At least you didn't rent yours from
a store called "It's Not Too Late."

247
- I'm changing out of this.
- Me too.

248
- In, like, a half an hour?
- Me too.

249
- All right, now throw it straight this time.
- Okay.

250
- I'm getting married next!
- Yay!

251
I hate my regular clothes now.

252
You know? I look down and I know...

253
...this isn't gonna be the most
special day of my life.

254
Yeah. I mean,
it was kind of fun for a while...

255
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?

256
I guess.

257
Oh, my God!

258
Oh, you're such a cheater!

259
Hello, little ones.

260
- Hey.
- Hey.

261
- So is Joey going to stop snoring?
- Yep!

262
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.

263
Joey wanted to ask her out,
but, uh, you know, she picked me.

264
How'd that happen?

265
Because I'm cooler.

266
No, seriously.

267
She's the kind of girl...
Joey was unconscious.

268
Hey, you guys! What's happening?

269
Oh, my God.

270
- What is that?
- Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.

271
And it's going to help me not to snore.

272
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

273
You don't have to
wear it unless you are.

274
I know I don't have to.

275
It tastes good.

276
Plus, you look cool.

277
Well, I just called Joshua.

278
Oh, how'd it go?

279
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...

280
...some crazy girl
who is dying to get married.

281
- And I'm going through a hard time.
- What'd he say?

282
Well, uh, his answering machine
was very understanding.

283
I feel blue. Ugh.

284
- Aw.
- Sweety.

285
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.

286
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
I don't think I even care.

287
I don't think he's
the one I'm sad about.

288
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.

289
But as it turns out...

290
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.

291
Yeah, maybe.

292
And I'm just trying to figure out why.

293
Any luck?

294
Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I
have always been...

295
...on-again, off-again,
on-again, off-again?

296
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...

297
...we would be on-again.

298
Again.

299
You know what? I think we all did.

300
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
Hey.

302
- Ahem, hey.
- So.

303
I got us reservations for Sunday night.

304
How about Ernie's at 9:00?

305
Yeah, well, you, uh,
better make it for three.

306
See, I don't know if we're
going to be hungry at 3:00.

307
Three people.

308
Joshua's not going to be there.

309
- What happened?
- Um, well, I think he broke up with me.

310
No. Why?

311
Apparently, he scares easy.

312
Rachel, I'm sorry.

313
Eh, it's okay.

314
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.

315
Come here.

316
Oh, hey,
don't you have to go pick up Emily?

317
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

318
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

319
I got my girls.

320
Okay.

321
Ugh.

322
Hey, you know what might
cheer you up?

323
What?

324
I got to tell you...

325
...this really does put me
in a better mood.

326
Ah, I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.

327
Maybe someday there will be.

328
Oh, God, that's Chandler coming by
to borrow candles for his big date.

329
No, Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!

330
No, yeah!
The groom cannot see the bride.

331
I'm not going to marry Chandler.

332
Not after this!

333
Okay guys, just relax.

334
I do!

335
- I gotta go.
- Wait, Joshua!

336
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

337
Food's here. Fair enough.

338
Fifteen-minute warning.

339
Late.

340
Dude, I am trying to sleep!

﻿1
It seems like all of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
Phoebe's making people.

4
- Everybody's doing stuff.
- We just sit here.

5
If I died, the only way
people would know I was here...

6
...would be by the ass print
on this chair.

7
Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge.

8
We could climb Mount Everest.

9
No, no. Not something stupid.
Something huge.

10
No, no, no.
I saw an ad for this video.

11
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that.

12
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

13
It's just steep.

14
Yeah.

15
We're going to Everest. Okay?
It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.

16
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
- What's up?
- We're gonna climb Mount Everest.

18
- Yeah, baby.
- Really?

19
I looked into that.

20
Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die. And...

21
And you would die.

22
Oh, well.

23
We could get that Everest video.

24
Yeah, we could do that without,
you know, risking our lives at all.

25
While we're down at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard.

26
Oh. You know what?
I just remembered.

27
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

28
Oh, well.

29
So you guys will stay here
and hang out with me?

30
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
But I'll tell you, one of these days...

32
...we're gonna get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again.

33
Yeah, we are.

34
So, what did we decide?
Does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

35
Oh, God.
Nobody likes him.

36
And he's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

37
Yeah, invite him.

38
Hey, did I do these neat enough?

39
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Yeah?

40
If anyone asks,
we'll say that Ben addressed them.

41
Oh. So you invited Rachel then?

42
Sure, why not?

43
- Really?
- Yeah.

44
Well, I don't think I'd be comfortable
having any of my old lovers there.

45
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you think we shouldn't invite her?

46
Oh, no, no, Ross,
you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

47
It's just that, well, I thought
it might be a bit awkward for you.

48
But it's absolutely your decision.

49
- More tea?
- Yeah, sure.

50
- Earl Grey?
- Huh?

51
Fine, yeah,
invite whoever you want.

52
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

53
And I just want a million dollars.

54
Rachel?

55
- Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God.
- Hi.

56
Okay. Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

57
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

58
...and Joey.

59
- Do you remember my brother, Ross?
- Sure.

60
- Hey. Oh, God.
- Hi.

61
You know, back in high school...

62
...I had a, um, major crush on you.

63
- I knew.
- You did? Oh, okay.

64
I always figured you just thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

65
- I did.
- Oh.

66
Listen, do you think...?

67
And try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor here.

68
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime maybe?

69
Yeah.

70
Maybe.

71
Okay.

72
Okay, maybe I will.

73
See, I see, uh...

74
...big passion in your future.

75
- Really?
- I do.

76
Oh, Ross, you're so great.
Aw...

77
It's never gonna happen.

78
Okay, I have a question.

79
Well, uh, actually,
it's not so much a question...

80
...as more of a general wondering...

81
...ment.

82
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
Um, well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to, um...

84
- Oh...
- Yes. Yes. That's...

85
- Look at that little kitty.
- That's right.

86
- What?
- That little kitty.

87
Top of the world looking

88
Down on creation

89
And the only explanation I can find

90
Listen, missy, if you want this cart,
you're gonna have to take me with it.

91
Yes.

92
- Did you see that?
- You were incredible.

93
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

94
Thank you. I could not
have done this without you.

95
Okay, um... Uh...

96
More clothes in the dryer?

97
- Oh.
- Oh!

98
I'm fine. I'm fine.

99
You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

100
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie...

101
...before I found out about you.

102
I was doing great
before I found out about you.

103
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

104
Well, the point is
I don't need this right now.

105
Okay? It's too late.

106
I'm with somebody else.
I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

107
All right, fine.
Go ahead and do that, all right, Ross?

108
I don't need your stupid ship.

109
- Good.
- Good.

110
Oh!

111
Oh.

112
Do you realize this is the first time
I'm doing something I care about?

113
This is the first time I'm doing
something I'm actually good at.

114
If you don't get that...

115
I get that. I get that bigtime.
And I'm happy for you...

116
...but I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

117
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

118
Is this about Mark?

119
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

120
Oh, my God.

121
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

122
No. You're making this too hard.

123
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

124
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, maybe we should just take a break.

125
You're right. Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

126
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

127
No.

128
A break from us.

129
- Do I know why we're rushing?
- You know the girlfriend I told you about?

130
It turns out that she, uh, wants
to get back together with me.

131
Oh, I found it!

132
- That's so great for you guys.
- Yeah.

133
- Good luck with your girlfriend.
- Oh, thank you... Ah, hey.

134
Rachel!

135
Hi. Oh...

136
- You got my message?
- You are right on time.

137
So, what do you say?
Can I be your girlfriend again?

138
Yes, you can very much.

139
Ah!

140
- I want you to leave. Get out.
- No. No.

141
I wanna stay.
I wanna talk about this.

142
All right. How was she?

143
Oh-oh.

144
- What?
- Was she good?

145
Don't answer that.

146
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

147
She was...

148
- Awful.
- She was not good, not good.

149
Nothing compared to you.

150
She was different.

151
- Ooh!
- Oh-oh.

152
Good different?

153
Nobody likes change.

154
Oh! Just stop.

155
The way you owned up to everything...

156
...it just showed me how much
you've grown, you know?

157
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

158
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

159
Mm-hm.

160
Oh...

161
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

162
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

163
We were on a break!

164
You seem to really like her.

165
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
We agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.

166
You know? No commitment.

167
Ross, that girl just spent
the entire evening talking to your friends...

168
...asking to hear stories about you...

169
...looking through Monica's photo albums.

170
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

171
You think? Heh.

172
You've got like 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

173
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

174
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

175
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

176
Oh, this is so amazing.

177
I can't believe my brother's
getting married, and in London.

178
It's so romantic.

179
Hey, pretty smart.

180
Tissue paper.

181
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

182
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

183
Oh, look, isn't this adorable?

184
Ross let Ben address mine.

185
- Hello.
- Hey.

186
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
Hey, did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

188
No.

189
Don't worry, man, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

190
I'm so jealous you're all going.

191
I can't believe I never knew
you can't fly in your third trimester.

192
- I never knew that.
- I didn't, either.

193
I knew that.

194
So didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

195
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Hey.

196
We're hanging out.

197
What's this?
Is this Ross' wedding invitation?

198
Maybe that's the one
we should have actually hidden.

199
Oh, no. No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

200
I'm happy for him.

201
I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...

202
I'll work on it.

203
I'm sorry, honey.

204
Mm.

205
Rach, you're going to come though,
aren't you?

206
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...

207
This isn't one of those
"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

208
Because I already bought my ticket...

209
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

210
- Just say you'll think about it, okay?
- No, I'll think about it. Yeah.

211
- Who's this from?
- That's Ross'.

212
Oh.

213
Oh, my God.

214
He remembered.

215
Remembered what?

216
It was like months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

217
I saw this pin, and I told him
it was just like one my grandmother had...

218
...when I was a little girl. Oh.

219
I can't believe he remembered.

220
This must have cost him a fortune.

221
I can't believe he did this.

222
Remember back in college
when he fell in love with Carol...

223
...and bought her
that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

224
What did you just say?

225
Oh, my God.

226
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

227
Oh, my God.

228
- We were in school together.
- We haven't seen each other since then.

229
Well, I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

230
Julie!

231
Julie! Isn't that great?

232
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

233
Oh, that is so sweet.

234
No... Heh.

235
No... Okay.
No, you hang up.

236
No, you...
Okay. Okay.

237
One, two, three.

238
You didn't hang up either.

239
- She didn't hang up.
- She didn't hang up either.

240
Okay, no.

241
No, you hang up.

242
You. You. Y...

243
Ross, hi.

244
It's Rachel.

245
I'm just calling to say
that, um, everything's fine.

246
And I'm really happy for you...

247
...and your cat.

248
So obviously, I am over you.

249
I am over you.

250
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

251
Rach, I got a message from you.

252
Oh, my God, no.
Hang up the phone. Give me the phone.

253
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

254
You're over me?

255
Oh, God.

256
- What...? You're, uh?
- Oh, God.

257
You're over me?

258
- Oh, my God.
- When were you...

259
...under me?

260
Basically, ahem...

261
...lately, I've, uh...

262
Ahem. I've sort of had feelings for you.

263
Okay, I need to lie down.

264
He broke up with Julie.

265
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

266
- Really?
- Really.

267
It's always been you, Rach.

268
Oh, God.

269
Oh...

270
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

271
Oh, that's okay.

272
- You're worth the wait.
- Oh.

273
And I don't just mean tonight.

274
I never dreamed
That I'd meet somebody like you

275
I never dreamed
That I'd lose somebody like you

276
No, I don't want to fall in love

277
Oh, God!

278
Oh. Honey.

279
Oh, that's okay.

280
Oh, no, you just rolled over
the juice box.

281
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

282
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

283
I'm sorry.

284
Was I not supposed to?

285
You're the one who ended it.

286
Yeah, because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

287
You still love me?

288
No.

289
What does this mean? What do you...?
I mean, do you want to get back together?

290
No. Maybe.

291
- I don't... I don't know.
- What?

292
I just... I feel...

293
I can't believe I even thought of getting back
together with you. We are so over.

294
Fine by me!

295
And, hey, just so you know,
it's not that common...

296
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

297
I knew it!

298
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?

299
Oh, my God.

300
- This is us getting ready for the prom.
- Oh!

301
You know what?
We don't have to watch this.

302
- Yeah, we do.
- Come on.

303
Fun.

304
Get a shot of Monica.

305
Wait, how do you zoom out?

306
There she is.

307
Shut up.
The camera adds 10 pounds.

308
Huh, so how many cameras
are actually on you?

309
Dad, turn it off.

310
- It is off.
- Yeah.

311
Right, Ross?

312
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

313
I can't go to my own prom without a date.
I can't. It's too late.

314
If you're not going,
then I don't wanna go either.

315
I have a wonderful idea.

316
You should take Rachel to the prom.

317
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

318
- I want to see.
- Fine, I'm not going to watch, all right?

319
Come on, kid. Let's go.

320
Are you handsome.

321
Let's show them.

322
- Okay, Dad.
- Rachel, ready or not.

323
Here comes your knight in shining...

324
Oh, no.

325
- Bye. Don't wait up.
- Okay, Chip, let's go.

326
Oh, dear.

327
Jack, how do I turn this off?

328
I can't believe you did that.

329
Yeah, well...

330
See? He's her lobster.

331
No.

332
- You're really not going?
- Yeah.

333
It's just going to be too hard.

334
You know, I mean...

335
...it's Ross.

336
How can I watch him get married?

337
You know?
It's just for the best, you know? It is.

338
Plus somebody's
got to stay here with Phoebe.

339
She's going to be pretty big by then...

340
...and she'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

341
Drive her to the hospital
in case she goes into labor.

342
You don't have a car.

343
- And your license expired.
- I know.

344
Yeah. See, there's so much to do,
and I have so little time to do it in.

345
Check this out.

346
It says there's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

347
"It's almost as good as being there."

348
It's better. You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

349
Well, you could,
but probably just the one time.

350
I bet we could get videos
of all the sights...

351
...get a VCR in our hotel room,
we'd never even have to go outside.

352
If we do that,
we've got to rent Die Hard.

353
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.

﻿1
That was the 10th time I've peed
since I've been here.

2
It's also, like, the 10th time
you've told us. Ha, ha.

3
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry,
it must be hard to hear.

4
I'll tell you, it's easier
having babies playing...

5
..."Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk"
on your bladder.

6
I am so sick of being pregnant.

7
The only happiness I get
is from a cup of coffee...

8
...which of course is decaf
because, oh, I'm pregnant. Heh.

9
Pheebs, you want a cookie?

10
Thank you so much.

11
So, uh, Pheebs, honey,
how are those mood swings coming?

12
I haven't really had any yet.

13
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

14
All right. Here's the ring.

15
Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.

16
So, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party?

17
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18
Before you start handing out rings
and planning bachelor parties...

19
...don't you have to decide
who your best man's gonna be?

20
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward,
it's awkward.

21
I sort of already asked Chandler.

22
What? He got to do it
at your first wedding.

23
Joey, I figured you'd understand.
I've known him a lot longer.

24
Come on, Ross. I don't have any brothers.
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

25
You can be the best man
when I get married.

26
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

27
Wait, wait.

28
So you get to be my best man twice,
and I don't get to be yours at all?

29
Oh, no. Yeah, of course,
you can be my best man.

30
What about me? You just said I could.

31
I'm not even getting married!

32
Okay, this is a question
for science-fiction writers.

33
I can't believe you're not picking me.

34
- Hey, how could it not be me?
- I'm not even...

35
- I'm not even...
- All right, you know what? That's it.

36
From now on,
Joey I want you to be my best man.

37
Yes. Shame about you, though.

38
- Stop it.
- What?

39
One of the babies is kicking.

40
- I thought that was a good thing.
- It's not kicking me.

41
It's kicking one of the other babies.

42
Oh. Don't make me come in there!

43
- Hey.
- Hey.

44
Do you guys have, like,
a big bowl I can borrow?

45
Yeah, there's one
right under the cabinet.

46
- Thanks.
- Why do you need it?

47
Oh, we're having a party tomorrow night.
Later.

48
Hey, hey.
Are you planning on inviting us?

49
No. No, no. Later.

50
Hey, get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

51
Hormones.

52
What Phoebe meant was...

53
...how come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

54
Oh. It's Ross' bachelor party.

55
- So?
- Are you bachelors?

56
- No.
- Are you strippers?

57
- No.
- Then you're not invited.

58
All right, fine. You're not invited
to the party that we're gonna have either.

59
Oh, what party?

60
Well, um...

61
The baby shower for Phoebe.

62
Baby shower?

63
Wow. That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do. Later.

64
I can't believe I'm going to have a party!

65
Ha, ha. That's so great. A party!

66
Yay! Ha, ha.

67
- I don't know why.
- Oh.

68
This is what I got going
for the party so far liquor-wise.

69
- Get a lot of liquor.
- Great. Great.

70
Okay, now, uh, in terms of the invite list,
obviously I got you, me and Chandler.

71
And I'm invite Gunther because,
well, we've been talking pretty loud.

72
I'll be there.

73
Oh, listen. I know it's your party...

74
...but I'd really like to limit the number
of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

75
Yeah. Tell you what.
Let's not invite any anthropologists, okay?

76
Just the dinosaur dudes.

77
Okay, we'll need a six-pack of Zima.

78
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

79
Oh, just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

80
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top
the last one.

81
I don't think it's gonna be that difficult,
considering this one won't take place...

82
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut. Heh.

83
Oh, I'm Ross, I'm Ross.

84
I'm too good for the Hut.
I'm too good for the Hut.

85
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben.
Uh, everything so far sounds great, Joey.

86
Just remember,
keep it on the mellow side, okay?

87
Just a couple guys
hanging out playing poker.

88
- No strippers or anything, okay?
- You got it.

89
- Okay, see you later.
- Yeah.

90
Ha, ha. Have fun planning
your mellow party.

91
There's gonna be strippers there.

92
He didn't say anything
about no strippers.

93
- He just said, "No strippers."
- Oh. I chose not to hear that.

94
Look what I got, look what I got,
look what I got.

95
Oh.

96
Can you believe they made these
for little people?

97
Aw. Little Village People.

98
Aw, okay. Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

99
Oh, that is so sweet.

100
Phoebe's gonna love
dressing them in these.

101
Huh. Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be
the one who gets to dress them.

102
I guess she's not gonna get
to keep the babies.

103
Oh, my God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower.

104
Wait a minute. Unless we give her all gifts
that she can use...

105
...after she's done being pregnant.
Like, um, regular coffee. Tequila.

106
Oh, and somebody can get her those
leather pants she's always wanted.

107
Oh, she's gonna love that.

108
What the hell is this?

109
You actually thought
it'd make me feel better?

110
To give me something
I can't even use for another two months?

111
This sucks! Oh!

112
All right, what's my next present?

113
Hey, listen, man, about the stripper...

114
- Yeah?
- Good call.

115
A little announcement.
A little announcement.

116
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

117
What's my last name?

118
Central Perk?

119
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

120
Oh, hey, Gunther.
Don't forget your shirt.

121
Hey. Hey, what are those?

122
Little party favors. Check it out.

123
Wow, yeah.

124
Oh, oh, oh!

125
Aw.

126
Okay, little announcement.

127
Just want everybody to know
the position of my best man is still open.

128
And, uh, you know,
so is the position of the bride.

129
Great.

130
Smooth, man.
Yeah. You got some chili on your neck.

131
Well, I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great.

132
Okay? And hey, I'll see you guys
Monday morning.

133
- Thanks, Joey.
- Oh, hey. Don't forget your shirt.

134
Oh, thanks.

135
Ahem. Okay. Hey, museum geeks.
Party's over.

136
Okay, wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

137
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

138
Come on, boys, come on out.
Here you go.

139
Oh. Look at the birdies.

140
- Are those yours?
- Yeah.

141
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

142
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And I got the duck totally trained too.

143
Watch this. Stare at the wall.

144
Hardly move.

145
Be white.

146
You are really good at that.

147
- Oh.
- So I had fun tonight.

148
You throw one hell of a party.

149
Thanks, thanks.
Yeah, it was great meeting you.

150
And listen, if any of my friends ever get
married or have a birthday or a Tuesday...

151
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay. Ha, ha.

152
So, I guess, um, good night.

153
Oh, unless you, uh...
Unless you want to hang around.

154
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.

155
Hey...

156
Stripper.

157
The stripper stole the ring!

158
Chandler, get up, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

159
- What?
- The ring is gone!

160
Oh. Okay, just, like, give me a minute
to wake up for this.

161
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man ever.

162
Dude, this isn't funny.
What am I gonna do?

163
I go to sleep last night,
everything's cool.

164
I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

165
- You slept with the stripper?
- Of course!

166
Hi, guys.

167
Hi, Phoebe.

168
Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know,
seemed a tad edgy yesterday...

169
...at my shower.

170
You know, it's just the hormones.
You know?

171
- No, we... Hormones. Yeah.
- Hormones.

172
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you.
It was just... It was so sweet.

173
- Oh, okay.
- So sweet.

174
- Yeah.
- Wow, you seem to be doing much better.

175
- That's great. How are things going?
- Good.

176
No, but... Okay, it feels like everything's
been about me lately.

177
So, what's happening with you?

178
Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking
about me not going to Ross' wedding.

179
- Oh.
- It just might be too hard...

180
...given the history and all that.

181
Wow, this reminds me of the time
when I was, um, living on the street.

182
And this guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

183
Well, how is this like that?

184
Well, let's see. It's not really like that.

185
Because, you see,
that was an actual problem.

186
And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch
of high-school crap...

187
...that nobody really gives... Yeah.

188
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought...

189
All right, here come the waterworks.

190
Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

191
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

192
And I called 911 and they yelled at me.

193
If this isn't an emergency, then what is?

194
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

195
I just wanted to thank you for last night.
What a great party.

196
And the guys from work had a blast.

197
You know, one of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

198
Yeah, and another one had never been
to a party before, so...

199
So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?

200
- Man, that is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

201
Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one
of those babies up for myself.

202
Where might one get one of those?

203
That ring, when my grandmother
first came to this country...

204
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

205
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

206
Oh, absolutely.
It's been in my family for generations.

207
And every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

208
So you might say it's a magic ring.

209
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

210
My ring? My wedding ring?

211
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

212
How? How could this happen?

213
Well, I think it all started when you said,
"Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."

214
All right, all right. Fine.
I'm gonna call the cops.

215
Dude, I screwed up.
You don't have to turn me in.

216
- Not on you, on the stripper.
- Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.

217
They said they're gonna look into it
right after they solve all the murders...

218
Okay, we'll call the company
that sent her.

219
I did that too.

220
They wouldn't give me
her name or number.

221
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

222
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."

223
So, what, Joey? What are you telling me?
That there's nothing we can do?

224
- How could this happen?
- Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.

225
Well, what if we just, uh, called her...

226
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

227
Oh, that sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

228
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

229
Mm. It's so good.

230
Oh, thanks. That's sweet.

231
- Good.
- So glad you like it.

232
- Oh.
- What?

233
What? She made the tea.

234
No, I think I just had a contraction.

235
- You what?
- My God.

236
Yeah, I thought I felt one
a couple minutes ago.

237
- And now I know that definitely was one.
- Well, you can't have the baby here!

238
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

239
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

240
You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil
some water and just rip up some sheets.

241
Ow, it's all right.
It's probably false labor.

242
They said that, that can happen
near the end. So just...

243
- Somebody get the book.
- Rachel, get the book.

244
The book. Okay. Okay. Here.

245
- The Bible?
- I don't know!

246
All right. Okay, okay. This is great.

247
Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.

248
And when she comes in, hopefully
she won't recognize you because...

249
Well, why would she?

250
Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.

251
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

252
Diverse.

253
Anybody call for security?

254
You be cool.

255
Okay. Which one of you guys
is Gunther Central Perk?

256
Hey, Joey.

257
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's
wedding ring! Where is it? Where is it?

258
Way to be cool, man.

259
- What's he talking about?
- Oh!

260
There was a ring in a box
on my nightstand.

261
After you left, it was gone.

262
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?

263
Yeah.

264
We know you took it!
So just save yourself the time and confess.

265
Okay, Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

266
I don't need to steal some stupid ring.

267
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.

268
Any of you guys make that?

269
Marry me.

270
I don't get it. It was in my room all night.
If she didn't take it...

271
...and I didn't take it and you didn't take it.
Then who did?

272
Shh. We're trying to think.

273
I still don't get how you know
when it's false labor.

274
Well, do you see any babies?

275
- How do you feel?
- Okay, I guess. I mean...

276
I don't know.

277
I guess I know it's going
to be over soon so...

278
But isn't that a good thing?

279
- I mean, you said you were sick of this.
- I know.

280
It's just usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

281
...then you get to do the mom thing.

282
I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around
in my leather pants, drinking tequila.

283
Some moms do that.

284
Yeah, that's even sadder.

285
Look, I know what I got myself into,
you know?

286
It's just that now that they're in me,
it's like...

287
It's like I know them, you know, and...

288
It just not gonna be easy when, you know,
these little babies have to go away.

289
Oh. I know, sweetie.

290
But it's not like
you're not gonna have anything.

291
I mean, you're gonna have
nieces and nephews.

292
In some ways, that's even better.

293
- Yeah, okay.
- No, really.

294
Really, Pheebs.

295
I mean, you're not gonna be the one
worrying about saving for college.

296
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

297
You know?
Or deciding to put them on Ritalin...

298
...when they just won't calm down.

299
You know?

300
You're gonna be the one they come to
when they run away from home.

301
And the one they talk to about sex.

302
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

303
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

304
I am pretty cool.

305
Oh.

306
Yeah, and you know what else?
Oh, my God, are they going to love you.

307
- They are going to love me.
- Oh!

308
- Thanks, you guys. Again.
- Aw.

309
Oh, sweetie.

310
- Thanks. Oh!
- What? Oh, God.

311
Just kidding.

312
- Ah!
- Oh, my God.

313
Got you again. You're so easy.

314
- If anything should happen to him...
- Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure.

315
So? Things can go wrong. You don't know.
What if he doesn't make it?

316
- He will, Joe.
- Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

317
He's such a good duck.

318
I'm so worried about him.

319
- Somebody lose a ring?
- Aah!

320
Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Aah!

321
How's the duck?

322
He's doing just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

323
- Oh.
- Great.

324
Oh, hey, listen, Ross,
thanks for being so cool about this.

325
- No, that's all right.
- No, it's not.

326
I mean, you made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

327
- Hey, come on. It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

328
You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?

329
You know what?
Ross, you were right from the start.

330
- He should be your best man.
- No, you should.

331
- Look, don't argue with me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

332
I get to choose my best man.

333
I want both you guys.

334
Really?

335
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

336
I mean, you two are my...

337
I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...

338
Well, thanks, man.

339
I got to go check something, okay?

340
- What a baby.
- Total wuss.

﻿1
You guys, hurry up.
The flight leaves in four hours.

2
There could be traffic.
The plane could leave early.

3
When we get to London,
there could be a line at customs. Come on.

4
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

6
- Who are you saying "check" to?
- Myself.

7
For remembering to pack the thing.

8
You know, you do a good thing,
you get a check.

9
My mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.

10
Hey, my mom used to put her head
in the oven, so...

11
Actually, she only did it the one time.
But it was pretty weird.

12
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
Hey. Are you ready yet?

14
- Yep. You got the tickets?
- Oh, got them right here. Check.

15
It's all London, baby. Here we go.

16
You got your passport?

17
Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser.
You don't wanna lose that.

18
- Oh.
- There it is.

19
Okay, if you need the vacuum,
it's in my closet on the left side.

20
The garbage bags
are next to the refrigerator.

21
But Rachel's gonna be here too.
Can't I just ask her?

22
Heh. Yeah, okay. Give that a try.

23
- All right, let's do it.
- Woohoo.

24
- Yeah. Cheerio.
- London, baby.

25
- Because that's not gonna get annoying.
- London, baby!

26
- Oh, you know what? I was wrong.
- Ha, ha.

27
Well, we're all here.
I guess we should get going.

28
Oh, I wanna come over there
and give you a hug...

29
...and wish you luck on your wedding,
but I can't get up.

30
- Oh, I'll come hug you.
- Great, can you bring me the newspaper?

31
Yeah.

32
- Have a great wedding. Oh.
- Thanks.

33
- Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too.
- Hey.

34
And you might as well bring me my book.
It's on the counter in your apartment.

35
Oh.

36
- So we're off.
- Have fun.

37
- Thanks.
- Oh.

38
Oh. I can't believe
you're not gonna be there.

39
Oh, I know.

40
- So come. Why don't you come?
- What?

41
To London. Come to London. Please?
It would mean so much to me.

42
Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.

43
- Why can't you take a couple of days off?
- Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.

44
This is my wedding.

45
All right, you know what? Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

46
Fine, you'll watch it on video
when we get back.

47
Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo,
Phoobala, Phobayboo.

48
You. Ha, ha.

49
All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.

50
- Bye.
- Bye, Pheebs.

51
Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.

52
- Bye.
- Safe flight.

53
London, baby.

54
- Oh, God.
- Oh. Do you need a hug?

55
You don't have to bring me anything.

56
All right, Chandler, do something.

57
- Come on, do something.
- I am. I'm ignoring you.

58
Okay, I'm gonna be
the on-camera guy. All right.

59
First stop, Westminster Abbey.

60
- Oh, what the hell is that?
- That's London, baby.

61
All right, the hotel's here.

62
Wait. No, we wanna go...

63
No.

64
I know.

65
I'm gonna have to go into the map.

66
Okay, if you see a little version
of me in there, kill it.

67
I got it.

68
Here we go.

69
Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have
to walk this way the entire time, are we?

70
Shh.

71
Oh, man, you made me lose it.

72
And that was all before 10:00.

73
The caterer rang to say it's gonna be
chicken kiev instead of tarragon.

74
The florist phoned
to say there aren't any tulips.

75
Oh, and then the cellist
has carpal tunnel syndrome...

76
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?

77
- Well, up yours too.
- What?

78
- No, no. That's "time-out."
- Sorry.

79
Sweetie, you gotta relax.
Everything's gonna be great, okay?

80
Come on, come on.

81
- Chicken kiev?
Mm-hm.

82
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

83
I know, but something like salmon
would just...

84
It would be so much more elegant
than chicken.

85
And you wouldn't have to worry
about the salmonella.

86
Oh.

87
I can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

88
Yes. This place is beautiful.
Emily's parents got married here.

89
I still can't believe
they're tearing it down.

90
It really is the most lovely building
you'll ever see.

91
I mean, it's over...

92
Oh, my God.

93
It's nice.

94
Oh. Oh, my God.

95
How can this be happening?
What are we gonna do?

96
Everything's gonna be all right.

97
- How is it gonna be all right?
- Uh-huh, I see that.

98
Okay, I talked to the guy
and found out what happened.

99
- What?
- They tore it down a few days early.

100
All right.

101
Westminster Abbey.

102
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

103
Hey.

104
Okay.

105
What do you think of the abbey,
Chandler?

106
Oh, I think it's great.
They're thinking of changing the name.

107
- Really? To what?
- To "Put the Camera Away."

108
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

109
- Honey, don't get up. What do you need?
- Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

110
Come on. I'm here to take care of you.
What do you need? Anything.

111
Okay, I have a wedgie.

112
Okay, that is all you.

113
So, what do you want for lunch?

114
Oh, I don't know.

115
- I guess we have to eat.
- Yeah, I do.

116
What's the matter?

117
I'm just bummed
the way I left things with Ross.

118
I wish I didn't lie to him
about having to work.

119
He seemed so mad at me.

120
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself.
If someone I was still in love with was...

121
- Still in love with?
- Yeah.

122
I'm not in love with Ross.

123
Oh.

124
No, no. Good.

125
Yeah, me neither.

126
Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

127
...and that would be
really uncomfortable.

128
Not because I'm still in love with him.
Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.

129
You know, clearly I have feelings for him,
but feelings don't mean love.

130
You know, I mean,
do I still have loving feelings for Ross?

131
Yeah.

132
I have continuing feelings of love.

133
But that doesn't mean
that I'm still in love with him.

134
You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings
for him, but I do love him.

135
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

136
Why didn't you tell me?

137
- We thought you knew.
- We?

138
Yeah, we all know.
We talk about it all the time.

139
You all know? Does Ross know?

140
Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.

141
Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.

142
Because we thought you knew.
It's so obvious.

143
God, it would be like, you know,
telling Monica:

144
"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."

145
Hi.

146
So, what are you fine gentlemen
in the market for?

147
- We've got scarves, souvenir postcards.
- Check this out, huh?

148
Oh, yeah.

149
That's the stuff. What do you think?

150
Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that
"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

151
Well, I like it. Here you go.

152
You're not really gonna buy that. Don't you
think you've embarrassed me enough?

153
Oh, I embarrass you?

154
How can I answer that
when I'm pretending I don't know you?

155
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in.
All Londoners wear them.

156
Oh, really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

157
They're all tourists.

158
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that
in public, you know...

159
...you're gonna spend the rest
of the afternoon all by yourself.

160
Oh, yeah?

161
If you're gonna make me choose
between you and the hat, I choose the hat.

162
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

163
Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?

164
I'm out of here.
I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.

165
- Hello?
- Hey.

166
I just spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

167
He thinks we'll be able
to find a new place.

168
- We don't have to.
- What, you found a place?

169
No, but Monica and I were talking...

170
...and I was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

171
...and she suggested
that we just put the wedding off for a bit.

172
- She said what?
- She said if I'm not happy...

173
...getting married somewhere we can find
in a day, well, we should just postpone it.

174
Postpone it? Heh.

175
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how
much our parents spent on this wedding?

176
Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny little brain comprehends...

177
...that people took time
out of their lives...

178
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here? Huh?

179
This isn't right.

180
I realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.

181
But they'll come back
when we can do it right.

182
Well, I can't ask people to do that.
Would you ask people to do that?

183
Don't you point your pants at me.

184
We have no choice.

185
Anywhere that's half-decent
will have been booked months ago.

186
Ross, don't you understand?
This is our wedding.

187
The only thing I understand
is postponing it is not an option.

188
This is when we're getting married.

189
- What are you saying, it's now or never?
- No, I'm saying it's now.

190
- Or?
- There's no "or" in mine.

191
What is wrong with these pants?

192
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.

193
And if you don't understand
how important this is to me...

194
...perhaps we shouldn't
be getting married at all.

195
Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...

196
- Hey.
- Hi.

197
So did shopping help you feel any better
about Ross?

198
Manhattan does not have enough stores.

199
Well, I think I can help you get over him.

200
- You can?
- Yeah.

201
I just need you to bring me
some photos of Ross...

202
...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...

203
...and a glass of tepid water.

204
Ooh. Is this one of those things where you
throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...

205
...and hang it from a north-facing tree?

206
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.

207
The pictures are for you.
The chocolate and water's for me.

208
I just didn't feel like getting up.

209
Okay. I'm gonna show you
a picture of Ross, okay...

210
...and you're going to remember
all the bad things about him, all right?

211
- Really focus on his flaws.
- I can do that.

212
Certainly did that
while we were going out. Heh.

213
Okay. Mm.

214
Before we get started, I just wanna say,
for the record, I love Ross.

215
I think he's such a great guy.

216
Okay. Now close your eyes.

217
- And imagine that you're with Ross.
- Mm-hm.

218
- Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him.
- Mm-hm.

219
You're running your hands
all over his body.

220
And then you run your hands
through his hair...

221
...but, oh, ew, gross,
it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.

222
Ah?

223
I don't know.

224
I don't know,
his hair never bothered me that much.

225
And you know, it was always more crunchy
than it was greasy.

226
Okay. This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

227
Um, ahem.
Let's try some aversion therapy.

228
- Okay. All right.
- Okay? All right.

229
- Look at the picture.
- Okay.

230
All right, and, um...

231
Ow!

232
- Okay. How do you feel now?
- Well, I like you less.

233
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
- Oh. Sorry.
- No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.

235
I shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

236
That really wasn't cool.

237
And if it makes you feel any better,
I've had a really lousy day.

238
Me too.

239
- Yeah?
- No!

240
I had the best day ever.

241
Dude, check this out.

242
- Hey.
- Shh, shh, shh.

243
Say hi to my friend
and tell him you like my hat.

244
- Okay, so, what's your friend's name?
- Oh. Chandler.

245
Hi, Chandler.

246
That's... That's...

247
- Oh, my God.
- That's Fergie, baby!

248
Joey says you don't really like his hat,
but I think it's kind of dashing.

249
When did you...? How...?

250
I was trying to figure out
how to get to Buckingham Palace.

251
So I'm in my map and...

252
Hey.

253
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
I understand you had a little talk
with Emily.

255
Ha, ha. Yes, I did.

256
And you are welcome.

257
Am I?

258
And was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

259
Um...

260
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Wait up.

261
Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

262
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?

263
- She said that?
- Yeah.

264
- Why?
- I don't know.

265
I told her it was stupid to put off the
wedding just because the hall was gone...

266
...and she, like, flipped out.

267
Oh, my God.
You're even dumber than I am.

268
Excuse me?

269
Ross, how long
have you been planning this wedding?

270
I don't know. A month?

271
Emily has probably been planning it
since she was 5.

272
Ever since the first time she took
a pillowcase and hung it off her head.

273
That's what we did.

274
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

275
In the perfect place.

276
With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.

277
With the little people on top.

278
But the most important part...

279
...is that we had the perfect guy...

280
...who understood just how important
all that other stuff was.

281
I had no idea.

282
That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys
were just doing The Flying Nun.

283
Sometimes we were.

284
Come on.

285
You gotta help me figure out what to do.

286
- Okay?
- All right.

287
Come on.

288
- Whoa. Pretty intense, huh?
- Yeah.

289
I hope Ross didn't think we went in there
because we were uncomfortable out here.

290
I hope he did.

291
- Hello?
- Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.

292
Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.

293
I just saw someone that looks just like you
on the subway.

294
I was gonna go over and say hi, but then
I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.

295
That just cost me 4 bucks.

296
I just called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

297
They're having a great time
with Aunt Phoebe.

298
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.

299
So do you miss me?

300
Kind of,
but I've just been having way too much fun.

301
Oh, so you're not homesick yet?

302
No, I don't think so.

303
All right, well, the seven of us miss you.

304
- Who's seven?
- Well, you know, me, Rachel...

305
...the birds, the babies.

306
Aw, the babies miss me?

307
- Ooh, pizza guy's here.
- What? You ordered pizza without me?

308
Yeah, but we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

309
Two pizzas?

310
- Yeah. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later.
- Wait, wait. Where did you get it from?

311
Where everybody knows your name

312
And they're always glad you came

313
You wanna be where you can see
The troubles are all the same

314
You wanna be
Where everybody knows your name

315
- Monica, why have you brought me here?
- You'll see.

316
I tell you,
this wedding is not gonna happen.

317
Oh, Ross.

318
Okay? But imagine a lot more lights, okay,
and, you know, fewer bricks...

319
...and flowers and candles.

320
Okay, and the musicians,
they can go over here, okay?

321
And the chairs,
they can face this way and...

322
You go.

323
But if you don't love this,
then we'll do it any other place...

324
...any other time.

325
Really, it's fine. Whatever you want.

326
It's perfect.

327
- And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...
- Well, then we'll get wet.

328
Aw.

329
I don't even have a date.

330
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

331
Do you remember where the duck food is?

332
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

333
Because I'm going to London.

334
What? What do you mean,
you're going to London?

335
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.

336
Now, honey, you take care, and you don't
have those babies till I get back. Mwah.

337
Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.

338
I know, I know, I know he does,
but I have to tell him how I feel.

339
He deserves to have all of the information.
Then he can make an informed decision.

340
That's not why you're going.
You're going because you hope he'll say:

341
"Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget about that British chippie."

342
Do you think he will?

343
No, because he's in love
with the British chippie.

344
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna
mess with his head and ruin his wedding.

345
You know? It's too late.
You missed your chance.

346
I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.

347
But it's over.

348
You know what? No.
It's not over until someone says "I do."

349
I do. I do! I do!

350
Yeah, like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter.

﻿1
Previously on Friends:

2
- I can't believe you won't be there.
- I know.

3
Why can't you take a couple of days off?

4
- Because I can't.
- This is my wedding.

5
- I can't wait to see it.
- Her parents got married there.

6
It's the most beautiful place.
It's right over...

7
Oh, my God!

8
The only thing I understand is
postponing is not an option.

9
This wedding is not gonna happen.

10
If you don't love this, then we'll do it
any other place or time. It's fine.

11
It's perfect.

12
- I'm going to London.
- What?

13
It's not over until someone says, "I do."

14
I do! I do! I do!

15
Rachel, no!

16
The Waltham residence.

17
Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?

18
This is the housekeeper.

19
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

20
First one identifies oneself...

21
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

22
Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.

23
I was wondering, please...

24
...if it's not too much trouble, please...

25
...um, might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

26
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

27
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

28
No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.

29
Could you just give me their number?

30
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

31
Somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding,
and I have to warn them.

32
So give me that number
or I'll come over there...

33
...and I'll kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

34
Hello? Hello? Oh!

35
Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

36
Hi, sweetheart.

37
Mom, Dad.

38
Oh, sorry, we're late.

39
My fault. I insisted on riding the tube.

40
Judy, the kids!

41
That's what they call the subway.

42
Oh!

43
I thought...

44
Dad, we got it.

45
Oh! Here comes my dad and stepmom.

46
Mr. And Mrs. Geller.

47
This is Steven...

48
...and Andrea Waltham.

49
How do you do? Very nice to meet you.

50
- Ha, ha!
- Eh, darling, the Gellers.

51
Darling, it's the Gellers.

52
She's self-involved.
I should never have married her.

53
- Sorry, what?
- It's the Gellers.

54
- Where?
- That's one and that's another one.

55
Lovely to meet you.

56
Nice of you to pay
for half the wedding.

57
Oh, the hell with tradition!
We're happy to do it.

58
Oh, we know how expensive
weddings can be.

59
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

60
Ahem, ha, ha.

61
A joke that's funny in all countries.

62
Sir?

63
- What's in it?
- Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

64
That's not food.

65
No, I don't want it.

66
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

67
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

68
I can't remember
what Phoebe looks like!

69
Joey, it's been three days.

70
Oh.

71
Okay, you're just a little homesick.

72
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

73
You're different here too.

74
You're mean in England!

75
What the hell?

76
What's up, Dad?

77
This bill for my half. It's insane.

78
Why is it so much?
The reception's at their house.

79
Flowers, liquor. Re-carpet first floor?

80
New guest bath, landscaping.

81
I'm paying to remodel this house.

82
I'll give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

83
Dad. Please.

84
I don't want anything to upset Emily.

85
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

86
Here. Let me go talk to him.

87
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

88
Ooh, Jack.

89
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

90
And I'll go get drunk.

91
Oh! Oh! Oh!

92
- Hi.
- Hello.

93
Hello.

94
Um, when is your next flight to London?

95
- There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
- Oh!

96
And I do have one seat left.

97
Oh, thank you, thank you.

98
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

99
Ugh. I don't have enough left
on my credit card.

100
You can split it with another card.

101
Okay, how about five?

102
Oh, thank you.

103
I need to see your passport.

104
I don't have it, but I can tell you
where it is on my nightstand.

105
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

106
And I have a 20.

107
Face it, my father is not gonna pay
for the built-in barbecue.

108
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

109
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

110
Ah! Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

111
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

112
Will you say something, Steven?

113
Don't take that tone with me.

114
All right, you can.

115
- Hi, Pheebs.
- Oh, thank God!

116
Oh, you changed your mind. Ugh!

117
You probably don't want
to talk about it.

118
You're doing the right thing.

119
- Bye, Pheebs.
- Where are you going?

120
What are you doing? No, wait.

121
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

122
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

123
My big toast is tomorrow.

124
This is kind of my little toast,
or Melba toast, if you will.

125
Okay.

126
Ahem. I knew Ross when he was, uh,
going out with his first girlfriend.

127
Oh, heh.

128
I thought things would work out
until he over-inflated her.

129
Oh, dear God!

130
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

131
Oh! Hi, Mrs. Waltham.

132
I need to speak with, um,
one of the best men or Ross' sister.

133
- Who is this?
- Oh, Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

134
If you're Ross' friend,
why aren't you here?

135
Um, I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

136
Oh.

137
Am I on the radio?

138
No. Um...

139
...can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

140
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

141
Oh!

142
We're excited that, uh, Ross and Emily
are getting married at Montgomery Hall.

143
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

144
Oh, come on, Monty Hall!

145
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!

146
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

147
Hey. Best man number two,
Joey Tribbiani. Ha, ha.

148
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

149
But, uh...

150
...congratulations to the happy couple.

151
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

152
Home.

153
New York City.

154
Where everybody knows my name.

155
Uh, anyway...

156
...uh, I love you guys.

157
But not as much as I love America.

158
Can we please go home now?

159
Are you going home?

160
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

161
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

162
I was laughing.

163
Out loud?

164
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

165
So how are you doing?

166
My mom's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married!

167
I'm happy. I won't let anything spoil that.

168
Mm-hm.

169
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

170
Oh, thanks. We like him. Ha, ha.

171
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

172
There's no way in hell I'm paying for it.

173
Look, we're down to just one point.

174
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

175
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

176
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

177
The guy was hammered.
There's no way you look like Ross' mother.

178
- Then why would he say it?
- Because he's crazy!

179
Earlier, he thanked me for my very
moving performance in Titanic.

180
My mother's right. I'll never get married.

181
Ha! You know what, that is...

182
Who wouldn't want you?

183
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

184
I'm getting married today!

185
Whoo! Heh.

186
Morning.

187
I'm getting married today!

188
- Yeah, you are.
- Woo-hoo!

189
Do you think he knew I was here?

190
I've never done that with you before. Heh.

191
Nope. Ha, ha.

192
So, uh, how are you?

193
You okay?

194
Yeah, yeah.

195
- You?
- Oh, yes, yes.

196
Uh-huh.

197
You?

198
We did you.

199
Hmm.

200
Well...

201
- I better get going.
- Oh, absolutely. Ha, ha.

202
Could you not look?

203
I don't want to look.

204
- Uh, uh, excuse me.
- Yeah.

205
If you're planning on doing that
the entire flight...

206
...please tell me now
so that I can take a sedative.

207
Or maybe slip you one.

208
It's just, I'm, uh, kind of excited.

209
I'm, um, going to London
to, uh, tell this guy that I love him.

210
- Hello.
- Where the hell have you been?

211
Hey.

212
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid. She is...

213
I don't want to hear it!

214
Aw, Pheebs, you know you're still
my number one girl.

215
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

216
Oh, great!

217
No, she's coming to tell Ross
that she loves him.

218
But he loves Emily.

219
I know that!

220
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

221
Okay.

222
I've done my part, okay?

223
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

224
Right.

225
So tell me about this girl.

226
Hey. Have you seen Monica?

227
I'm not seeing Monica.

228
- What?
- What?

229
Look, we gotta find her.

230
Phoebe called. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

231
- Oh, my God.
- I know. We gotta find Monica.

232
- Know where she is?
- No, okay?

233
What's with the third degree?
Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?

234
Then I realized all this stuff
I had been doing...

235
...proposing to Joshua,
lying about why I couldn't come...

236
...was all just a way of...
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

237
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

238
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

239
Pardon me?

240
You're about to ruin
the happiest day of his life.

241
I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

242
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

243
- But he has to know how I feel.
- But why?

244
He loves this Emily.
No good can come of this.

245
Ugh! I think you're wrong.

246
Oh, no!

247
By the way, it seems to be clear
you were on a break.

248
Oh, my God!

249
It's like a fairyland.

250
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

251
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

252
- Ha! I just hope...
- You can let some go by.

253
Psst. Monica.

254
Start looking out for Rachel.

255
I'll cover the door.
You watch that big hole.

256
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

257
Why would I care where Chandler is? Heh.

258
You know, uh...

259
...sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

260
- Okay.
- Heh.

261
I do.

262
I do.

263
Oh, it's the second one.

264
Right?

265
Hello, Joey.

266
Hey, Felicity.

267
Um, I thought about you all day.

268
- Yeah?
- Ha, ha.

269
Talk New York to me again.

270
- Forget about it.
- Heh.

271
How you doing?

272
- Mm!
- Ha-ha-ha.

273
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

274
You have to meet me in the middle.

275
My foot will meet
the middle of your ass.

276
- What's going on?
- Oh, everything's under control.

277
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you're saying?

278
That's it!

279
Parents! Parents! Back away!

280
This is our wedding day!

281
From now on, everyone gets along.

282
And if I hear one more word...

283
...no grandchildren!

284
That's right!

285
Okay, okay.

286
Sorry, old boy.

287
Sorry. Sorry.

288
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

289
What was that about?

290
It was this disagreement over...

291
My God! You look beautiful.

292
Oh!

293
Oh! You can't see me
before the wedding. It's bad luck.

294
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

295
My God, heh, Rachel!

296
You're here. I can't believe it.

297
- Ha.
- Uh...

298
Why are you here?

299
I just came to...

300
I just needed to tell you...

301
...congratulations.

302
Waltham Interiors.

303
Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.

304
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

305
There's a girl on the phone for you.

306
Oh, great!

307
Hello?

308
It's Phoebe.

309
Did you stop Rachel?

310
But she just hugged him. That's it.

311
- Nothing got ruined?
- No.

312
Oh, that's so great!

313
Oh! So, what's going on now?

314
Uh...

315
...I'm walking down the aisle.

316
Still walking.

317
Now I'm at the front with Ross.

318
It's Phoebe!

319
He looks pretty mad.

320
Uh, I better go.

321
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

322
- What we did last night was...
- Stupid. Hmm.

323
- Totally crazy, stupid.
- Ha, ha.

324
What were we thinking? Heh.

325
I'm coming over tonight though, right?

326
Oh, yeah, definitely.

327
Friends, family...

328
...we are gathered to celebrate...

329
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

330
May the happiness of today...

331
...be with them always.

332
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

333
- I, Emily.
- I, Emily.

334
- Take thee, Ross.
- Take thee, Ross.

335
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

336
...till death parts us.

337
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

338
...until death parts us.

339
Now, Ross.

340
Repeat after me.

341
I, Ross.

342
Take thee, Emily.

343
Take thee, Rachel...

344
Emily!

345
Ha. Emily.

346
Uh...

347
Shall I go on?

﻿1
Hey. We are so in luck.

2
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff from the basement.

3
Wait right there.

4
Oh, no, no. I'm paddling away.

5
Huh?

6
Wow. Really?
We got all this rusty crap for free?

7
Uh-huh.
This and a bunch of bubble wrap...

8
...and some of it is not even popped.

9
Could we be more white trash?

10
How desperate am I?

11
Oh, good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

12
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party for her.

13
- How come?
- Because I need the money.

14
And I thought it'd be a great way to get rid
of that last little smidgen of self-respect.

15
Come on, I think this is a good thing.

16
I don't think Mom would've hired you...

17
...if she didn't think you were good
at what you do.

18
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

19
Hey, um, do you guys have any juice?

20
Just pickle.

21
Hey, uh, Rach. Funny story.

22
I bumped into Joanna
on the street yesterday.

23
My boss, Joanna?
Wow, that must have been awkward.

24
Well, no. Actually, she asked me
if I wanted to get a drink.

25
You, uh, didn't say yes to that, did you?

26
Ha, ha. No. No.

27
Hello, Rachel.

28
Well, not at first.

29
What is she doing here?

30
I don't understand.

31
Last time you went out with her,
you said she was a dud.

32
I think I judged her too quickly.

33
And this time, we were able
to take the relationship to the next level.

34
Well, last time, I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

35
It's not like this is an everyday occurrence
for me.

36
I mean, usually I'm pretty much
in there by myself.

37
Chandler.

38
Promise me you will end it.

39
- Okay. I promise I'll end it.
- Thank you.

40
But I hope you know
what I'm giving up for you.

41
Because she's not just the boss
in your office.

42
You know what I mean?

43
Yeah.

44
Oh, sorry. I knew what he meant.

45
How's the hired help?

46
Doing great. Quiches are coming along.

47
What's this? Blue nail polish?

48
Yeah, I thought it was cute.

49
Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

50
Let me ask you a question.

51
Why did you hire me?

52
Oh, well, Richard raved
about the food at his party...

53
...of course, you were sleeping with him.

54
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was very nice.

55
I assume you weren't sleeping
with anyone there.

56
Though,
at least that would be something.

57
Oh, my God. Did you hear that?

58
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

59
Okay, I didn't hear that.

60
Yeah. She didn't hire me out of pity.

61
It wasn't so she could pick on me
in front of her friends.

62
She actually thinks I'm good.

63
Wow. And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian.
Ha, ha.

64
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

65
Uh...

66
Do you, uh, currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

67
No, no, but, uh, try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

68
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.

69
Let me ask you one question.

70
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

71
...and you just nod along...

72
...even though you're not really sure
what they're talking about?

73
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

74
- I hear you. Yeah it is.
- I totally agree.

75
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

76
No.

77
It was like the Algonquin kids' table.

78
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

79
You haven't said anything
for about two and a half minutes.

80
Are you at all interested?

81
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
Come on.

82
- That's weird.
- What?

83
Your nails.

84
Oh, I know. I never wear fake ones.

85
I just did it so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

86
No, I meant it's weird that
you only have nine now.

87
Oh, my God.

88
Wait a minute.

89
I had them when I put...

90
Oh, my God. It's in the quiche.

91
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, don't panic.

92
I'm gonna go to the store,
get you another set of nails.

93
No one is gonna know,
and you're gonna look great.

94
Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat...
That's the problem.

95
Honey, don't bite your nails.

96
Okay, uh, please don't freak out.

97
Um, but there's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

98
And there's no way to know which one.

99
And whoever finds it wins the prize.

100
Ha, ha. I'm not freaking out.

101
Why are you laughing?

102
It's nothing. It's just that now
your father owes me $5.

103
Ha, ha. What, you bet I'd lose a nail?

104
Oh, no, don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

105
- Frozen lasagnas?
- Mm.

106
You bet that I'd screw up?

107
So all that stuff about hiring me
because I was good was...

108
No, that was all true.

109
This was just in case you
pulled a Monica.

110
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

111
Honey, come on. Have a sense of humor.

112
You're never able to laugh at yourself.

113
That's right. Ha, ha.

114
My mom doesn't have any faith in me.
Oh, that's hilarious.

115
I don't get it.

116
No. I have faith.

117
No. You have lasagnas.

118
Oh, the ruined quiches are ready.

119
It just doesn't feel
like we're breaking up.

120
No, we are. I'm sad.

121
Okay.

122
Yes?

123
Uh, can you wait till tomorrow? All right.

124
Unbelievable.

125
Thanks.

126
No, no. That was my boss. I have to go.

127
Okay.

128
What are you doing?

129
- I'm getting dressed.
- Why?

130
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage at me.

131
Wait. I want to show you something.

132
What is it?

133
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.

134
Put your hands together.

135
You're not the boss of me.

136
Yeah, you are.

137
Hmm. Saucy.

138
I'll be back in two minutes.

139
You're, uh...?
You're going to leave me like this?

140
Knowing you're here waiting for me,
I think that's kind of exciting, don't you?

141
Okay, but if you don't come back soon...

142
...there's pretty much nothing
I can do about it.

143
- Oh.
- Hi. I brought you back a macaroon.

144
Oh, great. I'll keep it in my butt
with your nose.

145
That's weird. She locked the door.

146
You know why?
She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.

147
I saw her working on it this morning.

148
Okay, swear you won't tell.

149
But when Mark left,
he gave me a key to Joanna's office.

150
- You want to see the list?
- Yeah.

151
Hi.

152
How are you?

153
Hello, Joanna...

154
-'s office.

155
I'm sorry. I may be a little longer.

156
- How little?
- A couple hours. I feel awful.

157
Look, this isn't funny.
You get back here now.

158
- I can't.
- Why not?

159
I'm in my boss' car.

160
- What?
- Uh-oh, tunnel.

161
What?

162
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?

163
Okay, here's the situation. Ahem.

164
The keys to the cuffs
are on the back of the door.

165
Could you be a doll...

166
...and grab them and scoot on over here
and unlock me?

167
And on a totally separate subject,
that is a lovely pantsuit.

168
You promised you would
break up with her.

169
I did break up with her.
She just took it really, really well.

170
And the fact that you were jeopardizing
my career never entered your mind?

171
It did enter my mind.

172
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

173
You know what, Chandler?

174
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out them.

175
No, no, no.
I can't get myself right out of them.

176
You must have me confused
with the Amazing Chandler.

177
Come on, you have to unlock me.

178
She could be gone for hours,
and I'm cold and...

179
Ugh! Chandler. All right. This is it.

180
You never see Joanna again.

181
Never.

182
- You never come into this office again.
- Fine.

183
- You give me back my Walkman.
- I...

184
I never borrowed your Walkman.

185
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one.

186
You got it. Here we go.
Come on. This is great.

187
- Aw.
- Does it hurt?

188
No, I just always see guys doing this
when they get handcuffs taken off.

189
Hello, sweet pants.

190
Wait a minute.
What are you gonna tell Joanna?

191
About what?

192
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna
know I let you out and I'm gonna get fired.

193
I'll make something up.
I'm good at lying.

194
I actually did borrow your Walkman.

195
No, there's nothing to make up.
She's gonna know I have a key to her office.

196
I've gotta get you locked
back the way you were.

197
Oh, I don't think so.

198
Well, this is much better.

199
So here's somebody interesting, Joey.

200
What do you know about Van Gogh?

201
- Uh, he cut off his ear.
- And?

202
I'm out.

203
He painted that.

204
Wow. That's pretty nice.

205
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

206
- What else you got in there?
- Let's see, uh...

207
- Where does the Pope live?
- In the woods.

208
Wait, wait, that's the joke answer.

209
Actually, it's Vatican City.

210
Now, uh, what do you know about,
uh, vulcanized rubber?

211
Spock's birth control.

212
You need these books.

213
- Hey.
- Hi.

214
This used to be your room?

215
Wow. Oh, you must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

216
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

217
I can't believe I actually thought
she could change.

218
Look, who cares what your mom thinks?

219
So you pulled a Monica.

220
Oh, good. I'm glad that's catching on.

221
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

222
You know, go down there
and prove your mother wrong.

223
You finish the job you were hired to do
and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

224
What?

225
Okay, um, if a kid gets straight A's,
his parents would say:

226
"Yeah, you pulled a Monica." Ha, ha.

227
Oh, or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
"Yeah, no, he pulled a Monica."

228
Or someone hits a home run,
and the announcer says:

229
"Yeah, that one's out of here."

230
Because some things don't change.

231
All right. I'll go down there.

232
But I'm not gonna serve the lasagna.
I'm gonna serve something that I make.

233
Wait.

234
Ooh.

235
Oh! Wow.

236
Wow, my breasts are really strong.

237
Chandler.

238
Chandler, please. I have to get you
locked up back the way you were.

239
I'm so going to lose my job.

240
She's very private about her office.

241
Now I know why.

242
Hey, look.
You're in trouble either way, okay?

243
If she comes and sees me
locked to this instead of the chair...

244
...she's gonna know you were in here.
So you might as well just let me go.

245
- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
- Still wouldn't be clean.

246
All I want is my freedom.

247
- Foot rubs for a month.
- Freedom.

248
I'll take all your photos
and put them into albums.

249
Freedom. I want my freedom.

250
Why won't you hear me?
Sophie, help me.

251
- Help me.
- Sophie, sit.

252
God, would you just calm down?

253
I'm going to say this for the last time.

254
Would you please just...?

255
Wow, there's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

256
In a minute.

257
So, what do you say, Joey?

258
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

259
That works out to just 50 bucks a book.

260
Twelve hundred dollars?

261
You think I have $1200?

262
I'm home in the middle of the day...

263
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

264
I guess there's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

265
Well, uh, what can you swing?

266
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

267
You don't have anything?

268
You want to see what I got? Okay.

269
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

270
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

271
...a rock...

272
...and an army man.

273
Okay, I get the picture.
Uh, thanks for your time.

274
And a fifty.

275
Huh. These must be Chandler's pants.

276
For 50 bucks you can get one book.

277
What will it be? A? B? C?

278
I think I'm gonna stick with the V.

279
I want to see how this bad boy turns out.
Heh.

280
I, uh, will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts.

281
- No.
- Oh.

282
I, uh... Oh, I'll squeeze you
fresh orange juice every morning.

283
- With extra pulp?
- Yeah.

284
No.

285
I've got it.

286
You don't have it.

287
I have so got it.

288
There's gonna be rumors about this.
There's no way to stop it.

289
Sophie knows,
Monica and Phoebe know.

290
- How do Monica and Phoebe know?
- Oh, I called them.

291
When they ask me what I saw...

292
...I can be very generous...

293
...or very stingy.

294
- Go on.
- I can make you a legend.

295
I can make you this generation's
Milton Berle.

296
- And Milton Berle has...
- Oh. Not compared to you.

297
- Well?
- They're not even touching the lasagna.

298
- Really?
- Oh, they love your casserole.

299
Yes.

300
It's hard to believe, just a little while ago,
this was nothing but ingredients.

301
Everyone seems to like your dish.

302
And you?

303
I thought it was...

304
...quite tasty.

305
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it...

306
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you...

307
A bitch?

308
Well, I was going for "wrong,"
but we can use your word.

309
Yes, well, I was wrong.

310
And I have to say...

311
...you really impressed me today.

312
Wow.

313
Um, you might even say
that she pulled a Monica.

314
She doesn't know we switched it.

315
And the next time you cater for me...

316
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

317
Well, that really means a lot.

318
Oh, Mom, don't bite your nails.

319
- Hello.
- Hey.

320
Hello, Chandler.

321
I love you.

322
Hey, what's going on?

323
Oh.

324
No, he doesn't.

325
Two hours, that lasted.

326
So did you break up with Joanna?

327
I think so.

328
Well, it's a good thing you got out when
you did, before she blew up like Vesuvius.

329
- The volcano?
- Yeah.

330
And speaking of volcanoes, man,
are they a violent, igneous-rock formation.

331
What?

332
Oh, yeah. Lava spewing, hot ash.

333
Of course, some are dormant.

334
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

335
Oh, we can talk about something else.

336
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

337
The vas deferens?

338
The Vietnam War?

339
Oh, did anybody see that documentary
on the Korean War?

340
Oh, yeah.

341
Oh, God,
Korea's such a beautiful country.

342
- With such a sad history.
- Yeah.

343
Could there be more Kims?

344
- Who's out there?
- It's me. Good morning.

345
Rachel, could you come in here a moment?

346
Yeah, sure. Um, they didn't have
poppy-seed bagels...

347
...so I have sesame ones... Oh, my word.

348
I...

349
I seem to have had
a slight office mishap.

350
Could you get the key
off the back of the door?

351
Yeah, sure. I...

352
I'm so sorry.

353
Tell your friend Chandler
that we're definitely broken up this time.

354
Okay.

﻿1
Hey, new wallet?

2
It was time.

3
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

4
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

5
I know,
but the garbage was full.

6
Have you ever taken out the trash?

7
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

8
- Third door on the left.
- Right!

9
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

10
What are you doing?

11
Um... Oh! Oh!

12
I'm sorry.

13
It's a little old but...

14
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

15
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

16
Aw, of course not.
You're a little princess.

17
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

18
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

19
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

20
You think you can come here...

21
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

22
Think of someone else for a change.

23
Okay, I'm sorry.

24
God, if you're going to cry about it!

25
- Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?
- Yes.

26
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

27
I'll teach him a lesson.

28
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

29
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

30
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

31
My God.

32
Is this a gym card?

33
Oh, yeah, gym member.

34
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

35
...the last 1200 times.

36
So why don't you quit?

37
You don't think I've tried?

38
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

39
They make you go
all the way down there.

40
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

41
And then they bring out Maria.

42
- Who is Maria?
- Oh, Maria!

43
You can't say no to her.

44
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

45
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

46
- No.
- You're strong enough to face her?

47
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

48
Tribbiani.

49
Hold on. I'll get the plunger.

50
Hey. You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

51
So you'll go and apologize to her...

52
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

53
And tell him what?

54
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

55
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

56
I have actually not heard of that.

57
Your friends are violating it.

58
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

59
I'm telling the landlord...

60
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

61
Your friends are out of here, pal.

62
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

63
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

64
What's the matter?

65
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

66
Every time I see him,
I want to...

67
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

68
So do them for free.

69
No, it is forbidden.

70
No, no. Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

71
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

72
They make you take one?

73
No, I made myself take one.

74
No fooling around with clients...

75
...and, um, always be prepared.

76
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

77
Why not give him to someone else?

78
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

79
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

80
You got a pedicure.

81
Your feet are all dressed up.

82
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

83
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

84
I don't know what
you're talking about. Heh.

85
How do you explain the toe ring?

86
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

87
My hero! What happened?

88
Well, I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

89
And he better apologize.
See you!

90
Wait a minute.

91
- What did he say?
- Uh...

92
He wouldn't apologize, because
you're living here illegally.

93
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

94
- You got us evicted?
- I told you not to go down there.

95
He made Rachel cry!

96
Rachel always cries!

97
That's not true!

98
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

99
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

100
All right, I'll try.

101
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

102
- Go!
- All right, all right.

103
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

104
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember what
we talked about. You got to be strong.

105
Yes, yes!

106
Now one more time.

107
Don't you want a washboard stomach...

108
...and rock-hard pecs?

109
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

110
- Good. That's good.
- Okay.

111
I want to quit the gym.

112
You want to quit?

113
I want to quit the gym.

114
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

115
I want to quit the gym.

116
Dave in the Membership Office
handles quitters.

117
Excuse me. Are you a member?

118
Me?

119
- No.
- Sorry. Members only.

120
I want to quit the gym!

121
It's okay, man. Be strong.

122
So are you a member of any gym?

123
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

124
Okay, no problem.

125
Could you come here?

126
Hi, I'm Maria.

127
Hi, M...

128
Wow. You have really pretty feet.

129
These old things? Ha.

130
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

131
You mean...

132
By sciatic, you mean...

133
...the towel-covered portion?

134
Yeah.

135
Sure, I can do that.

136
Because, um, the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

137
...real nice and tight.

138
Yeah. So, um, tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

139
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

140
Oh.

141
Ow!

142
- Did you just bite me?
- No!

143
What?

144
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

145
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

146
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

147
- You have pets?
- No. No, no, no.

148
Those are, uh, nicknames.

149
I'm the chick,
and Chandler's the duck.

150
Huh. I would've thought
it was the other way around.

151
Come on. Let the girls stay.

152
I'll do whatever you want.

153
Really? You'd do anything?

154
Yeah, absolutely.

155
- I got something.
- What is it?

156
Can you be my dancing partner?

157
That's not prison lingo, is it?

158
- His dancing partner?
- Yeah.

159
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

160
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

161
Why not practice with a girl?

162
He's too shy.

163
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

164
Yeah, right.

165
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

166
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

167
- Hey.
- So did you quit?

168
No. I almost did.

169
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

170
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

171
And that's funny, why?

172
Oh, ahem...

173
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and...

174
Well, that's it.

175
We're doomed.

176
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

177
What'll we do?

178
You could actually go to the gym.

179
Or...

180
Or we could go to the bank...

181
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

182
You're a genius.

183
Oh, man! But then
we won't be bank buddies.

184
Now there's two reasons.

185
Hey.

186
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

187
I bit him.

188
- Where?
- On the tushy.

189
And that's not against your oath?

190
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

191
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

192
Next time, try to distract yourself.

193
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

194
...and I don't want to get too...

195
...excited.

196
I try and think of other things.
Like, uh, sandwiches...

197
...and, uh, baseball...

198
...and, uh, Chandler.

199
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

200
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

201
Okay, uh, well...

202
...just follow my lead.

203
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

204
Like get really drunk?

205
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

206
I'm sorry.

207
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

208
...my breasts are coming out my back.

209
Ah, forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

210
My mom was right.

211
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

212
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

213
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

214
Marge will never go for me.

215
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

216
You just need more practice.

217
Come on. Let's try it again.

218
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

219
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a... Whee-hee!

220
- Hey!
- Yeah.

221
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

222
Ha-ha-ha. You guys owe me bigtime.

223
What was that?

224
- What?
- You just did a little dancy thing.

225
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

226
- You did a little hop.
- You are so enjoying this.

227
No, I'm not.

228
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourrée.

229
You know the words!

230
You are so into this!

231
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

232
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

233
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

234
It's like a sport, it's manly.

235
- Show me some "manly" moves.
- All right.

236
I don't know how to lead.

237
- Hello.
- Hi.

238
We'd like to close our accounts.

239
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

240
- No, no.
- No, we'd just like to close them.

241
Okay...

242
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

243
Would you come over here, please?

244
Hi, I'm Karen.

245
I want to quit the bank!

246
Okay. Baseball.

247
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.

248
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.

249
Oh, no, wait! No.

250
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches. Um...

251
Okay, on a plate.

252
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
No! No!

253
Chandler.

254
Okay, Chandler. Ooh, that's working!

255
Chandler's knees.

256
Chandler's ankles.

257
Chandler's ankle hair.

258
Oh, no!

259
Okay, you're all set. Heh.

260
Oh, wow! That was amazing!

261
- Was that really just an hour?
- Yeah.

262
In really long hour-world.

263
What?

264
Ugh! Okay...

265
I have an enormous crush on you.

266
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

267
...even though you give me
the feelings.

268
Wow. I had no idea.

269
But, uh...

270
I can always find another masseuse.

271
Really?

272
Yeah, really.

273
What?

274
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

275
Quiet down.

276
Mr. Simon's been waiting...
Oh, my God!

277
Why wasn't I offered that?

278
I'd definitely pay more for that.

279
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

280
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

281
...because Rick is, um, my husband.

282
Oh, really?

283
You'd better tell his other wife.

284
She called three times
asking where he is.

285
Yes, I will tell her.

286
- So you didn't leave the bank?
- No.

287
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

288
What will you ever use that for?

289
To pay for the gym.

290
Hey!

291
So I had a great day.

292
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

293
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

294
What?

295
- You got fired?
- Oh, my gosh!

296
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

297
Sweetie.

298
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

299
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

300
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

301
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

302
Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?

303
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

304
Ready for our last practice?

305
We're not getting that spin right,
because my place is small.

306
- Want to use our place?
- No, I had another idea.

307
We did it!

308
That was incredible!

309
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

310
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani. Heh.

311
Oh, my God! Look at the time.

312
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

313
Oh! Okay...

314
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

315
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

316
Aw, thanks, but no.

317
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

318
Okay, heh...

319
- Go get them, Treeger.
- Right.

320
Hey, uh...

321
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

322
- Really?
- Yeah.

323
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

324
No, I'm good.

325
You've got great experience.

326
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

327
They thought I was a whore.

328
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

329
Great. Thank you very much.

﻿1
Hello!

2
What's this?

3
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

4
There it is.
Just a phone number...

5
...a really hot girl gave me.

6
No big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number but...

7
Whoa!

8
Whoops! Heh. Almost lost this baby!

9
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,
and I go and drop it.

10
Thank you.

11
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

12
- When's your birthday?
- May 5th. Why?

13
I'm making a list of birthdays.

14
- Mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

15
Oh! She's pretty!

16
Pretty, uh, pretty girl. The pretty...
She's pretty.

17
- Go ask her out.
- Ha, ha.

18
- What's the worst that could happen?
- I could die.

19
Yeah, it's tough being single.

20
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

21
Ross, you guys went out once.

22
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

23
I tell people secrets.

24
It makes them like me.

25
Hey.

26
Phoebe.

27
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

28
But I'm unemployed.

29
My music is all I really have now.

30
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

31
All right, I'll do it.

32
I'll go get shot down.

33
Any advice?

34
Just be yourself...

35
...but not too much.

36
Wish me luck.

37
Good luck!

38
Wish it!

39
Hi. I was just sitting over there and...

40
Uh, my name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

41
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.

42
- Kathy with a K or a C?
- With a K.

43
Hey!

44
Wow, you are really good at this!

45
I'm out on a limb here!

46
I'm sorry. You're right.

47
But I should tell you
I'm waiting for a date.

48
And there he is now!

49
- Hey!
- Hey!

50
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

51
- I see you guys already met.
- Yeah.

52
I was trying to demonstrate...

53
...how I could get my
very large feet...

54
...into my even bigger mouth.

55
Didn't I tell you?

56
Always showing off.

57
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

58
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

59
Oh! Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

60
Smelly cat, smelly cat

61
What are they feeding you?

62
This chick sounds good.

63
Smelly cat

64
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

65
- Hi.
- Hi.

66
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to fight over the remote.

67
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

68
That's why I got up too.

69
You're kidding? I love him!

70
Sorry about this afternoon.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have...

71
Oh, please. Heh.

72
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

73
We were partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us.

74
- All of them had us making out.
- Ha-ha-ha.

75
That's good, because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

76
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Is it on?

77
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

78
Hey!

79
Oh, my God!

80
Oh! It's on!

81
Here we go, little fella.

82
What about the duck?

83
- The duck can swim.
- Of course.

84
My sticky shoes

85
My sticky, sticky shoes

86
Why you stick on me?

87
Baby

88
Thanks for the lights, honey.

89
Way to go!

90
Your cold makes you sound great.

91
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

92
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

93
- Aw.
- I love them.

94
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

95
- Have fun.
- Okay.

96
It's nice that
the medical community...

97
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

98
- You know, I like Kathy.
- Yeah?

99
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

100
She is.

101
She's smart and funny.

102
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about...

103
What?

104
You love her.

105
No, I don't.

106
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.

107
- Come on, just lay off him.
- Thank you.

108
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

109
All right.

110
Ooh, Kathy!

111
Kathy, I love you!

112
I need to write some depressing stuff
for my new bluesy voice.

113
But nothing sad has
ever happened to me.

114
How about your mom dying?

115
Or living on the streets
when you were 14?

116
Uh-huh.

117
I could write about when
my hair did that woo-hoo thing.

118
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

120
- Rachel's not here.
- Oh.

121
How's it going with her?

122
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

123
The kids will play together,
and when they're asleep...

124
...Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

125
...do a little playing ourselves.

126
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

127
Josh, these are my friends.

128
And that's Ross.

129
- Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

130
Dudes.

131
You played in college?

132
Aw, I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

133
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

134
No, wait. You organized their
game schedules on your Commodore 64.

135
It's getting late. I got to get
to the game, so I'll... head.

136
I'll miss you.

137
Dope!

138
Wow! Cute one.

139
- Very cute.
- I know. Isn't he great?

140
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

141
There's nothing boring about him.

142
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

143
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

144
Like on a class trip or something.

145
You know what else is
great about him?

146
Ugh, what's the word for an adult...

147
...who has no dinosaur toys
in their bedroom?

148
Oh...

149
What was that?

150
Monica knows.

151
It's this dumb thing Ross made up
to fool our parents.

152
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually giving it.

153
I cried the night you made that up.

154
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

155
I'm going to go get ready...

156
...for my date tonight...

157
...so I'll just head.

158
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

159
Hey...

160
You guys should come hear me. Ooh!

161
Hear me. Ooh!

162
My sticky shoes

163
Ew! Ew!

164
I lost my sexy phlegm!

165
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi, Ben.

166
- You look great!
- Thanks.

167
Yeah, okay...

168
Hey, Tommy!

169
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

170
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

171
My cell phone number
is on the counter.

172
Help yourself to the fridge.

173
I appreciate this.
I've been trying to date...

174
...this guy for a month.

175
I...

176
Uh, I'd appreciate it
if you'd drink your wine...

177
...after the kids are asleep.

178
Oh, uh...

179
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

180
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

181
Kathy! Kathy!

182
Hi, Kathy! Kathy!

183
Kathy!

184
Fetch! Fetch it!

185
Kathy! Kathy!

186
Kathy!

187
Hey. Chandler, what are you doing here?

188
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

189
- Hey!
- Okay.

190
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

191
Her date tipped me $10!

192
What are you doing?

193
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

194
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

195
You'll catch pneumonia!

196
You were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

197
- What?
- Are you serious?

198
How's that possible?
You barely know her.

199
I don't know. I just...

200
I can't get her out of my head.

201
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

202
I'm a horrible person.

203
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

204
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

205
You mean you stole it!

206
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

207
Hey.

208
We were just talking about you.

209
Really?

210
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

211
...with your head in the toilet.

212
Right in there!

213
Ninety-nine...

214
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

215
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

216
- Hey!
- Hey!

217
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

218
Oh, um... You know what? I already ate.

219
- It's 4:30.
- I had a big meal on Monday.

220
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

221
I see what's going on here.

222
- You do?
- Yeah.

223
You don't like Kathy.

224
You got me.

225
You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.

226
I made an effort to like Janice.

227
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?

228
- Yeah, right.
- Good. And hey, my treat.

229
Because you're not eating, right?

230
Right.

231
Ross isn't here.

232
Oh. Stop it!

233
I'll see you at the party?

234
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

235
Yeah!

236
I am so going to marry that guy.

237
- Ugh!
- What?

238
I think he's stealing from me.

239
Why?

240
Because he's stealing from me!

241
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi.

242
And soup.

243
I saw Josh. He looked yummy
in your leather jacket.

244
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

245
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really noodle water.

246
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

247
What are you doing?

248
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

249
I miss my sexy voice.

250
Sorry, Phoebe.

251
It's okay.

252
- How's the soup?
- Mm.

253
Oh! Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

254
- Is she great, or what?
- Ha, ha.

255
Huh? What do you think?

256
She's not really my type.

257
Not your type? She's gorgeous.

258
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

259
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

260
...my father in fishnet stockings.

261
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

262
I have a friend you'd like.
We could double date.

263
No, thanks.

264
I've got some ugly friends
who are available too.

265
I'm going to grab a beer.

266
I'll be right back.

267
- What was that?
- What?

268
Kathy's being really nice
and you walked away.

269
What do you want from me?

270
I want you to like her.

271
If that's too damn difficult,
then at least you could pretend.

272
I am pretending.

273
Then do it better.

274
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?

275
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.

276
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.

277
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

278
...in love with her,
that every minute...

279
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck
that you met her first!

280
That's pretty good.

281
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

282
Hey. Uh, Amanda just dropped me off.

283
That's one of the things
I love about her.

284
She's old enough to drive.

285
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

286
No. Sorry.

287
Where's Amanda?

288
Get me some cough drops.

289
I'm thinking you could bring her...

290
...and go to your old room
and not make out.

291
Cough drop, please?

292
At least she's not
going out with me...

293
...to get into R-rated movies.

294
Why don't you marry her?

295
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

296
Amanda and I...

297
You have nothing!

298
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

299
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

300
Oh, that is so sad.

301
What are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

302
...- is-stealing-from me?

303
So he stole a few bucks.
Big deal!

304
He got me something with it.

305
That's mine!

306
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

307
And give me my cough drops!

308
- Fine.
- Sorry.

309
- Here.
- Thank you.

310
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

311
You know...

312
Parading goats are parading

313
Parading down the street

314
Parading goats are parading

315
Leaving little treats

316
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

317
I like it.

318
- Gunther, kiss me.
- What?

319
Do it, Deputy! Do something!

320
Hey!

321
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

322
Can I sleep on your couch?

323
And I'm still waiting

324
For my papier-mâché man

325
Thank you, my babies.

326
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

327
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

328
- No.
- We kissed.

329
I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

330
I've been feeling guilty.

331
Okay

332
So, um...

333
...are we cool?

334
Okay.

335
I knew you would understand.

﻿1
- Thanks for the tasty dinner.
- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

2
What are you guys looking at?

3
Ross and the most
beautiful girl in the world.

4
Yeah, come to Papa!

5
I know!

6
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

7
...but did you see the ass on her?

8
What did you?
When did you?

9
How did you?
How did you get a girl like that?

10
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

11
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

12
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

13
But that's, like, the easiest era.

14
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured...

15
But, uh, I made her dinner.

16
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

17
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

18
Fine by me. Hope she wins.

19
Hey!

20
You have any wrapping paper?

21
Is it for my birthday present?

22
It was your birthday months ago.

23
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

24
I have a call in about that.

25
Oh. Okay.

26
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

27
Oh! The Velveteen Rabbit!

28
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real...

29
Don't touch it, because
your fingers have destructive oils.

30
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

31
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

32
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

33
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

34
Honey, that's so sweet.

35
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

36
It doesn't say that.

37
Does it?

38
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

39
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

40
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

41
It's got to be better than that book.

42
Ooh! Like a crossbow!

43
Once again, I am sorry.

44
Thank you. Bye.

45
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

46
Oh, my God! What happened?

47
Sixty guests.

48
Why'd you have to turn it down?

49
I don't have the money or equipment...

50
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

51
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

52
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

53
Moni-ca.

54
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

55
- Do you want to be a caterer?
- I don't know.

56
There you go! That's the spirit!

57
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

58
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

59
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

60
Neither have you.

61
Yes, but I'm doing this.

62
That would be great! Thank you.

63
- Hey!
- Hey!

64
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

65
Why?

66
You can pee here.

67
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, I can, of course.
Excuse me.

68
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

69
What are you getting
for her birthday?

70
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

71
Yes!

72
Yes! You have to get her
something really nice.

73
- I know!
- And not one of your coupons...

74
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

75
Ooh! A crossword! Can I help?

76
No!

77
Last week I got all
but three answers...

78
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

79
Fine.

80
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

81
- Hey!
- How'd it go?

82
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

83
Everyone loved the food.

84
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

85
The dead guy from today's best friend.

86
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

87
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

88
Thanks.
Check out my new catering stuff.

89
Look! I'm an omelet station!

90
- Omelet? Made to order?
- Ha!

91
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

92
Oh...

93
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

94
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

95
I used it to buy all this stuff.

96
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

97
Oh! Okay.
Sorry I acted like a bank.

98
Um, would you like to come in?

99
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

100
According to recent findings.

101
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

102
Uh, Mitzi is?

103
My hamster.

104
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

105
Have a seat.

106
Where?

107
Uh, oh! Do you, uh...?

108
Do you have any, um,
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

109
- What?
- Well, I do.

110
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

111
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

112
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

113
Okay, um...
Don't take this the wrong way...

114
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

115
- Is everything in the car?
- Did you settle the bill?

116
No. I hate this part.

117
Ooh! Oh! Look what we almost left!

118
- That's not mine.
- Oh.

119
Ooh. Look what we almost took!

120
Excuse me, Ms. Burkart?

121
Well, we're all cleaned up.

122
Oh. Good. Thank you.

123
Um, ahem...

124
And, well, there's
this small matter of the, um...

125
- Dear?
- The matter of...

126
...payment.

127
Jack used to handle the finances.

128
You know what we should all do?

129
Go see a musical.

130
Sure.

131
You know which one?

132
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

133
Do you know the name of that one?

134
I don't know, um, Grease?

135
No.

136
Rent?

137
Yes! Rent!

138
So when do you want to go?

139
What? I'm sorry. I can't, I'm busy.

140
Hey...

141
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. Ugh!

142
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

143
What did you get her?

144
A pen.

145
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?

146
- Ha, ha. You can't give her that.
- Why not?

147
She's not 11!

148
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

149
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

150
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

151
Sure, it is.

152
She needs a pen for work.

153
She's writing. She turns it over.
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"

154
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

155
She didn't have one.

156
For three years?

157
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

158
I can't shop anymore.

159
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

160
Thanks, man.

161
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

162
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

163
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

164
- Oh! You have to get our money.
- She couldn't stop crying.

165
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

166
I know, it's tough.

167
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

168
- What?
- Pay the caterer!

169
I've had a lot of jobs.

170
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

171
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

172
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

173
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

174
Okay.

175
So you think she's faking?

176
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

177
She sounded pretty upset to me.

178
You're a grand old flag

179
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave

180
She seems fine now.

181
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

182
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

183
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

184
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

185
And instead of the end of
the day, it's the end of time...

186
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

187
- Here.
- Wow. Thanks.

188
So, uh, what happened?

189
Nothing. I had to get out of there.

190
Next time, you take her
to your place.

191
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

192
- What kind of smell?
- I don't know. Soap?

193
- Listen, you like this girl, right?
- Yeah.

194
- You want to see her again?
- Yeah.

195
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

196
Yeah, okay. You're right.

197
I mean, uh, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

198
Yeah.

199
- It's endearing, really.
- All right!

200
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

201
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

202
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

203
Any luck?

204
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy."

205
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

206
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

207
...and you get her
something worse than that...

208
...like a regular pen.

209
She's really going
to love this, you know?

210
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

211
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

212
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

213
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

214
Oh, "pathetic"!

215
Hey! I've been looking
all over for you.

216
- Where?
- Our place. The hall.

217
I got something.

218
It's a book.

219
A book?

220
Is it a book that's also a safe?

221
It's a book that's just a book.

222
It's The Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.

223
So, uh, just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

224
You got it.

225
Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.

226
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

227
No, it came out to an even twenty.

228
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

229
Jeepers Creepers

230
Where'd you get those peepers?

231
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?

232
You didn't get the money?

233
Maybe I can try at intermission?

234
You know what? Let's just go.

235
No! Hey!
We're not leaving till we get paid!

236
I don't know who she thinks she is.

237
Enough is enough!

238
Hey, widow?

239
Widow? Excuse me? Excuse me!

240
Thanks. Um, clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

241
Um, but we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

242
...because you ate that service.

243
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

244
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

245
All right. I'll get my bag.

246
Good.

247
I'm going to leave some cards here.

248
Please think of us
for your next event.

249
You want to come inside?

250
Yes.

251
Yes, I do.

252
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

253
- Guess who.
- Uh...

254
Department of Sanitation?

255
- It's me.
- Ha, oh!

256
Aw!

257
What?

258
- Oh, Cheryl!
- Oh, Ross!

259
Oh! Oh!

260
Oh! God!

261
Aah! Oh, my God!

262
No! No!

263
It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

264
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

265
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

266
It's just a rat.

267
I did it! Aah!

268
I finished it! I did it all by myself!

269
And there's nobody to hug.

270
Move!

271
Hey! Hey, you guys!

272
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

273
Yay! So good!

274
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

275
How did it go?

276
The widow wouldn't pay, so
Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

277
I'm a hard-ass.

278
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

279
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

280
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

281
We should be partners.

282
We should be catering partners.

283
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

284
- Okay.
- I cook and you take care of the money.

285
Oh! It'll be like
I have a wife in the '50s!

286
- Hey.
- Hey!

287
How did she like the gift?

288
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

289
Yeah? That's great.

290
I got to tell you...

291
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

292
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

293
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
Hey. Happy birthday.

295
Thank you.

296
You know, uh,
Chandler got you a gift too.

297
No, he didn't.

298
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter. Ho, ho!

299
Happy birthday.

300
I'm sorry.

301
You really didn't have to.

302
- Wow!
- See...

303
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

304
Really? No, this is great!

305
- Thank you, Chandler.
- Oh. Yeah.

306
Aw. Heh.

307
Want to go to bed?

308
I'll be in, in a minute.

309
Oh, uh... Don't forget your coupon.

310
Good night.

311
Um, thank you for the gift.

312
Oh, uh, I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

313
...you don't always
know the exact time.

314
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

315
Uh, the book?

316
The Velveteen Rabbit?

317
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

318
What do you mean?

319
When Joey gave it to me he said:

320
"This is because I know you like rabbits,
and I know you like cheese."

321
Thanks. I love it.

322
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

323
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

324
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

325
Oh, yeah. He's my...

326
He's my best friend.

327
- Well...
- Good night.

328
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

329
Hi, uh, you don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

330
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

331
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

332
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

333
So, uh, would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

334
No?

﻿1
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
It was like torture.

3
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
It keeps getting worse.

5
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

6
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
And now I have seen her naked.

9
At least with her clothes on...

10
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
Smooth!

13
Wow...

14
Could you see up his robe?

15
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

16
- Here you go.
- I'll call you.

17
Great.

18
Hey, hey. Who was that?

19
Casey. We're going out tonight.

20
Going out? Wow.

21
It didn't work out with Kathy? Bummer.

22
No, things are fine.

23
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

24
- What?
- Yeah.

25
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

26
Wait...

27
- You're going out with Kathy.
- Yeah.

28
Why are you upset?

29
Well, I'm upset...

30
...for you.

31
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

32
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

33
Look, Joey.

34
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

35
But Casey...

36
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

37
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

38
...and gets you.

39
You got all that
from the back of her head?

40
It's time to settle down.

41
Make a choice. Pick a lane.

42
Who's Elaine?

43
Little Tony Tarzan

44
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

45
I don't know the next verse.

46
You could just go:

47
Greatest of ease

48
Ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma...

49
Then go right into it.

50
I like that.

51
How do you know about
"ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?

52
You know, I used to play.

53
That's right. The keyboards?

54
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

55
That's when I really found my sound.

56
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

57
Oh, my God.

58
- I completely forgot about your sound.
- Yeah.

59
He'd lock himself in the basement.

60
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound."

61
I want to hear "the sound."

62
No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.

63
Well, it's really personal stuff.

64
Play that funky music, white boy.

65
- Yeah, come on.
- No, you guys.

66
My keyboards are all the way...
Yeah, okay.

67
Okay, guys.

68
All right. Bring it on, you.

69
Here we go.

70
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

71
It's important that you understand...

72
...it's about communicating...

73
...very private emotions.

74
You know...

75
You should think of my work...

76
...as wordless sound poems.

77
- That's what...
- My God, play.

78
Well, you know, that was...

79
...terrific.

80
Really...

81
...bitchin'.

82
Wow. It was so wow.

83
Really?

84
Yeah. I mean, you should
play in public.

85
Wow, thanks, you guys. That's...

86
I want to play you another piece.

87
Oh.

88
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

89
This is so nice. I mean, I am so...

90
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

91
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

92
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it.

93
It was so moving.

94
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

95
You mean, music?

96
I know what you think.

97
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

98
Come in.

99
Hey.

100
Oh, God. Is that Baywatch?

101
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

102
So is Joey around?

103
No, he's not back yet.

104
Come in, have a seat. Bow or stern?

105
I don't have a preference. You?

106
I like it in the stern.

107
Of the boat.

108
Hello.

109
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

110
- What happened?
- We broke down.

111
I have to get transmission fluid.

112
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

113
- Why can't you tell her?
- I think my time is about to...

114
Joey? Joey?

115
Yeah?

116
I thought your time ran out.

117
Me too, but I guess I do have...

118
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

119
I guess it's just you and me, then.

120
Oh.

121
- Okay.
- Yeah, I think it is.

122
So what'd you do today?

123
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

124
- Looks great.
- And then it got canceled.

125
I could cut it.

126
Really?

127
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

128
Dog grooming?

129
Don't make my tail too poofy.

130
You have really great hair.

131
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

132
Joey also has great hair.

133
Yes, Joey has great hair.

134
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

135
What are you doing?

136
Checking if it's even.

137
Okay.

138
Looks good.

139
The phone! The phone's making sounds.

140
- Hello.
- Hey, dude, it's me.

141
Hey, it's Joey.

142
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

143
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

144
- What?
- It fell out.

145
I just figured we hit a dog.

146
Okay.

147
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

148
It's Joey.

149
Hey...

150
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

151
Yeah, no, stop apologizing. It's okay.

152
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

153
- I should probably go.
- Yeah.

154
Yes. Yeah...

155
I forgot my purse.

156
Oh...

157
I really did. I forgot my purse.

158
- This is bad. It's bad.
- Horrible.

159
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

160
The kiss was good.

161
- But that's bad.
- Here's what we do.

162
- We forget it.
- What?

163
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

164
Can you really do that?

165
I have to. He's my best friend.

166
And you're seeing him.

167
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

168
But with you...

169
No, don't. Don't, see?

170
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

171
I'm sorry.

172
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

173
I think we have to.

174
Okay.

175
- Bye.
- Bye.

176
Are you still out there?

177
No.

178
Electrifying

179
Infinite time

180
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

181
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go.

182
Thank you very much.

183
Hey, aren't you up next?

184
- I'm not playing tonight.
- Why not?

185
I can't follow Ross.

186
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

187
...who had to follow the Beatles. No.

188
Phoebe. Ross sucks.

189
The place has emptied because of him.

190
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

191
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time.

192
Okay. Phoebe...

193
You suck too.

194
Yeah, Phoebe.

195
You're awful.

196
You guys.

197
You suck too.

198
Man. I can't believe
I locked myself out again.

199
Hang on, buddy.

200
My God. What happened?

201
- Did you do all this? Why?
- I sure did.

202
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

203
You're amazing.

204
No, this is amazing.

205
A TV appears from nowhere.

206
The dream.

207
How did you afford all this?

208
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

209
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

210
I don't know.

211
No, you are.

212
You do this, you give me advice...

213
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

214
I'll do that.

215
With Casey?

216
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

217
- Or Casey.
- No, Kathy.

218
Could be Casey.

219
No, Kathy.

220
Consider Casey.

221
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

222
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

223
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

224
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

226
Thanks.

227
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

228
...and, you know, my talent.

229
Is that true?

230
- Well, kind of, yeah.
- Pheebs...

231
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

232
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

233
See, but...

234
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

235
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

236
If it bothers you this much...

237
...then I won't play anymore.

238
No, don't do that.

239
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

240
Yeah, okay.

241
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

242
Joey has the best boyfriend ever.

243
I kissed Kathy.

244
What? Are you serious?

245
- Does Joey know?
- No.

246
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

247
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

248
Which we all appreciate.

249
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

250
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

251
Don't say that. That's not true, is it?

252
- Yeah.
- He loves you.

253
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?

254
I said something to Phoebe.

255
And I thought it was a really good idea.

256
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, my God.

257
What am I going to do?

258
You'll have to tell him.

259
Why do I have to?

260
- Because you do.
- Yeah, I know.

261
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

262
- Hey.
- Hey.

263
Sambuca Margarita?

264
It that a real thing?

265
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.

266
Listen, Joe. I need to...

267
I need to talk to you.

268
What's up?

269
It's about Kathy.

270
I like her.

271
I like her a lot, actually.

272
You do?

273
Yeah.

274
Your timing couldn't be better.

275
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

276
What?

277
- Yeah, she broke up with me.
- When?

278
Just now, after acting class.

279
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

280
Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?

281
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

282
Yes, but I don't have to.

283
No, it's okay.

284
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

285
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

286
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

287
You might have your work
cut out for you.

288
When I talked to her, I got the feeling
she's into some other guy.

289
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

290
I think I know who the other guy is.

291
Who?

292
It's me.

293
I'm the other guy.

294
What?

295
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

296
...and one thing led to another, and...

297
And what? Did you sleep with her?

298
No, I just kissed her.

299
What? That's even worse.

300
- How is that worse?
- It's the same.

301
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her.

302
Who cares?

303
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you.

304
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

305
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line.

306
It's a dot to you.

307
Yes.

308
Yes, right. And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

309
Is that why you bought all this?

310
You know what?

311
I will not watch your TV.

312
I won't listen to your stereo.

313
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker
I won't eat. Know why?

314
Because...

315
It's all tainted with your betrayal.

316
This apartment is empty to me.
I'm not happy about you, either.

317
And just so you know...

318
...I made that bread for you.

319
Oh, my God. He's totally lost it.

320
What?

321
Phoebe. This cannot get any worse.

322
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

323
Thank you. Thanks.

324
I lost it.

325
I won't play anymore.

326
Would you... Can you finish my set?

327
After that? Yeah.

328
No, I mean, if I can help.

329
Like I could lose it.

330
- What?
- I played bad on purpose, guys.

331
- Oh.
- Oh.

332
You were playing bad this whole time.

333
Just that last song.

﻿1
Hello?

2
It's me. I know
you can't stand to be in the same room.

3
I just thought I'd try and apologize
over the phone...

4
Hello?

5
Look, I never
should've kissed your girlfriend, and I'm...

6
Stop calling!

7
Hey, hey, hey. This is 92.3 WXRK K-Rock...

8
...calling with our $1000 daily challenge.

9
All right.

10
What is the name of...

11
...your roommate who is very, very sorry
and would do anything...?

12
Ugh, turkey.

13
Ugh, giving thanks. Ugh.

14
Look, everyone,
it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.

15
Are things with Joey any better?

16
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him...

17
...trying to get him to talk to me.

18
Oh, wow. Eight hours.

19
So you could probably really use one
of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?

20
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that can be stolen from your office?

21
You shouldn't.

22
Speaking of Christmas...

23
...since Monica and I are starting
a new business and have like no money...

24
...this year maybe we could do Secret Santa
and then we each only buy one gift.

25
And there's the added mystery of,
you know, who gets who.

26
Who gets "whom."

27
I don't know why I do that.

28
Oh, I'm gonna take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

29
We haven't eaten yet.

30
I know, but all that work you're doing
to get it ready, and I just...

31
Hey, did either of you pick Rachel
for your Secret Santa?

32
- Because I wanna trade for her.
- I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.

33
Ooh.

34
Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her
so badly?

35
Because she exchanges
every gift she gets.

36
It's, like, impossible
to get her something she likes.

37
Come on, let's trade.

38
That's not true.
I got her that backpack and she loved it.

39
I remember how much she was crying
the day that big dog ran off with...

40
There was no big dog.

41
This sucks, because I already got her
this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.

42
- Her initials.
- Oh.

43
Maybe you can give it to somebody else.
Oh. Like Ross Geller.

44
Oh, you know what, though?
It's a girlie briefcase.

45
Who cares? He works in a museum.

46
Hey, what time is it?
The big game's about to start.

47
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

48
Thanks.

49
What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!

50
- God, what happened?
- Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.

51
People are trying to sleep in here.

52
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.

53
- Open it up. Let me see.
- Oh, I can't. It really kills.

54
Well, maybe you should put
some ice on it.

55
- Ooh, it looks bad.
- Maybe we should take you to a doctor.

56
No, my eye doctor is Richard.

57
I can't go to him
when I don't have a boyfriend.

58
He's really picky about his patients.

59
Okay, you've gotta go.
What's his office number?

60
Oh, like I remember his office number.

61
Speed dial 7.

62
Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye, and...

63
Is Richard Burke in today?

64
He's out of town.
Does she wanna see the on-call doctor?

65
- Yes.
- Yes. She's very excited about that.

66
It's so cool.

67
Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef
and I get to make all the decisions.

68
Hey, hey, I thought she told you
to follow the recipe exactly.

69
Okay, get out of my kitchen.

70
All right, okay. I think I'm making
some progress with Joey.

71
When I went into the apartment,
he went to his bedroom...

72
...but he only slammed the door once.

73
I mean, yeah,
he gave me the finger while doing it.

74
All right, I gotta call my mom and ask her
a left-handed cooking question.

75
So listen,
I picked Monica for Secret Santa...

76
...but I'm getting her something
for Hanukkah.

77
You wanna switch?

78
Oh, you know what?
I was trying to trade for, uh, ahem, well, you.

79
Really? Wow, that's so nice.
What are you gonna get me?

80
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking
something girlie for your office.

81
Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe
will switch with me.

82
Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

83
Oh, that's not true.
I got her lots of stuff she never took back.

84
Like?

85
Like that gold necklace
I got her last year.

86
When was the last time
you saw her wear it?

87
Well, she wore it all Christmas day
and then, uh...

88
Big dog?

89
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
What are you doing?

91
Sending back this stuff Chandler bought
out of guilt.

92
- Everything? Even the TV?
- No, I'm gonna put that in my room.

93
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.

94
But don't you think
you could hear the guy out?

95
When you and Rachel were together...

96
...if Chandler had kissed her,
would you hear him out?

97
That's a good point.

98
So how long you gonna punish him?

99
Five years.

100
You've sentenced him?

101
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

102
- But, Joey, the guy's your best friend.
- No, was my best friend.

103
I don't know why
you're pushing for him so hard.

104
With him out of the way as my best friend,
there's a spot open.

105
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

106
Wow. I'm honored.

107
You know what I'm gonna do
as my first act as your best friend?

108
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

109
All right.

110
Oh, but if you weren't my best friend...

111
Ah.

112
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?

113
I walk in the room,
and he won't even talk to me.

114
He just mumbles something in Italian.

115
And I know he only knows
the bad words.

116
Hey, Gunther, have you seen Chandler?

117
I thought you were Chandler.

118
But, um, one of you is over there.

119
Oh.

120
Hey, Joe.

121
I'll be right with you, okay?

122
Thanks for coming in.

123
Oh, my God.
How cute is the on-call doctor?

124
Oh. So cute that I'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

125
Dr. Burke will see you now.

126
Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke.
Dr. Burke's out of town.

127
The on-call doctor will see me now.

128
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

129
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

130
Ready?

131
Hey, I'm sorry. That...

132
- Where you going?
- My folks'.

133
Oh. Uh...

134
When you coming back?

135
I don't know.

136
I might stay there for a few days
while I look for an apartment.

137
What?

138
Yeah, you know, at first I thought
we could talk about this, work it out.

139
But seeing you two together, I don't...

140
Hey, look, what do you want me to say?
Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?

141
It's not about her. Okay?

142
But seeing you two together
just reminds me of what you did.

143
And I don't wanna live with someone
who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.

144
- So I'll see you.
- Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.

145
- I just... I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

146
And that's why I'm leaving.

147
Look, if you're not gonna stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

148
Okay? They have had a very difficult year,
what with the robbery and all.

149
When that guy was robbing us...

150
...and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for six hours...

151
...do you know what I was doing?

152
I was thinking about how I let you down.

153
- Wow.
- Yeah.

154
If I'd have known what kind of friend you
were gonna be, I wouldn't have worried.

155
- See you around.
- All right, wait, come on.

156
Just wait one second.
There has to be something that I can do.

157
If we still had that unit...

158
...I would get in there for six hours
and think about how I let you down.

159
What?

160
We got a box.

161
I remember the last time I saw you.

162
It was the morning I left for college.

163
You were just standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

164
Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.

165
Gotta tell you, you look great now.

166
- You look great too.
- You're an excellent patient.

167
So how does it look?

168
You've got a little scratch on your cornea.
You're gonna have to wear a patch.

169
Like a pirate?

170
If that helps you.

171
Ahem. So how long have you been working
with your dad?

172
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

173
I moved back here a couple months ago.

174
Ah.

175
- Big family dinner tonight?
- Uh...

176
No way.

177
I was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

178
- Oh.
- But we broke up.

179
Oh?

180
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

181
Oh.

182
So you made her
walk the plank, aye, matey?

183
You're not wearing the patch yet.

184
I know.

185
- He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
- I know. It's sick.

186
- Why is it sick?
- Because it's Richard's son.

187
It's like inviting a Greek tragedy
over for dinner.

188
I mean, come on,
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

189
Yeah, I could see where I'd be
your best shot, but no.

190
- Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.
- Yeah.

191
- What's twisted?
- Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.

192
Ew.

193
Ew, ew, ew.

194
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.

195
Is he okay in there?

196
He's fine.

197
You know, if things work out
between you and Richard's son...

198
...you'll be able to tell your kids
that you slept with their grandfather.

199
Fine, judge all you want to.

200
But married a lesbian, left a man at the altar,
fell in love with a gay ice dancer...

201
...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire,
live in a box.

202
So, now, ahem,
what exactly is the point of the box?

203
Chandler?

204
The meaning of the box is threefold.

205
One, it gives me the time
to think about what I did.

206
Two, it proves how much I care
about my friendship with Joey.

207
And three...

208
...it hurts.

209
- Oh, hey, hey, uh...
- Hmm?

210
Remember that necklace
I gave you last year?

211
Can I see it?

212
Why?

213
I just wanna check something.

214
Okay.

215
Now we'll see.

216
Air hole! Air hole!

217
Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.

218
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.

219
Huh.

220
Well, maybe, it, uh...

221
...it changed.

222
Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.

223
Isn't it better that I exchange it
for something that I enjoy...

224
...and I can get a lot of use out of?

225
What did you get?

226
Credit.

227
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

228
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.

229
Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.

230
- This is Phoebe.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

231
- And Joey.
- Hey.

232
- Joey.
- My brother, Ross.

233
- Hey.
- And Rachel.

234
- Hi.
- Ahem.

235
- That's Chandler.
- How do you do?

236
- What's...?
- Um, well, he's, um...

237
He's doing some thinking.

238
He's got it.

239
- Yes!
- Yeah!

240
- What happened?
- You kissed my girlfriend.

241
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

242
"Like them" like them...

243
...or "I'd like to get store credit
for that amount" like them?

244
All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.

245
- Where can I wash up?
- Here.

246
Let me show you.

247
The towels are hanging next to the sink.
And you can use the fancy soap. Ha, ha.

248
Thank you.

249
Fancy soap?
I thought we were saving that for the Pope.

250
See? He's nice, right?

251
Do you really wanna be in a relationship
where you can actually use the phrase...

252
..."That's not how your dad
used to do it"?

253
Wow, everything looks great.
Where should I sit?

254
Saved you a seat.

255
Sick, sick, sick.

256
Oh, I'll get it.

257
Gotcha.

258
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.

259
- Sorry.
- I don't think you should be talking at all.

260
I think you got too much thinking to do
to be talking and making jokes.

261
Okay, okay, you got it.

262
- Ross, could you pass me the yams?
- Sure.

263
Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

264
Will you stop?
What is the matter with you?

265
Heh, heh. We've got company.

266
There's nothing the matter with me.

267
See, I'm not completely devoid
of sentiment.

268
See, I have feelings.

269
Okay, fine.

270
You can't tell, but I'm trying
to break the tension by mooning you guys.

271
All right, look.

272
If this is just a big joke to you,
then forget about it, all right?

273
This means something to me.

274
If it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

275
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.

276
You're right. I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

277
I want you to be my friend again.
I swear I won't say another word tonight.

278
- So you're gonna take this thing seriously?
- Absolutely.

279
That sounds like another word to me.

280
Are you gonna take this seriously?

281
Okay.

282
Don't say that I have no sentiment.

283
This is a movie stub from our first date.

284
This is an eggshell from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

285
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

286
...were together.

287
Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter.

288
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

289
Though...

290
...you're not supposed to take these.

291
It's like a million years old.

292
We actually...
We have people looking for that.

293
Oh, this always happens.

294
Here, let me, um...

295
Thank you.

296
You have very beautiful...

297
...eye.

298
My friends all think this is weird.

299
I thought it was gonna be weird.
I almost called to cancel, but it really isn't.

300
I know. I mean, it's like me and your dad,
that's a totally separate thing.

301
Oh, I totally agree.

302
I mean, we're just two people
who find each other...

303
...very attractive.

304
Right?

305
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

306
No, no, really. Oh, was that not okay?

307
No, no, no, that was good.

308
That was, uh... That was a good kiss.

309
- Oh, my God. It didn't remind you of my...?
- Oh, don't say it.

310
- But it did, didn't it?
- Yes!

311
Oh, man.

312
I know.

313
I got it.

314
Oh.

315
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
- I want you to know how sorry I am...
- It's okay.

317
Chandler's the one I'm mad at, so...

318
Well, I'm still sorry.

319
- Is he here?
- In the box.

320
Chandler?

321
Oh, he can't talk right now.

322
Why not? What's going on?

323
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

324
- By being in a box?
- Joey had reasons.

325
They were threefold.

326
Oh. Well, uh...

327
...you not being able to talk
might actually make this easier.

328
Listen, um...

329
Listen.

330
I don't wanna be someone
who comes between two best friends.

331
I just... I can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

332
And I don't wanna be the cause of that.

333
So I don't think
we can see each other anymore.

334
I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago.

335
I'm gonna stay there for a while.

336
I think this could have been something
really amazing.

337
But, you know,
this is probably for the best.

338
You know?

339
I'm gonna miss you.

340
Goodbye, Chandler.

341
Open the box.

342
- What?
- He can still catch her.

343
Hey, come on. Get out of there.
Get out of there.

344
- So...?
- Yeah, we're gonna be fine. Get out.

345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

346
You did some real good thinking in there.

347
I mean, this is...

348
Now go. You could still catch her.

349
And merry Christmas
from your Secret Santa.

350
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.

351
Oh, he sees her.

352
Aw, and he's catching up to her.

353
Oh, she sees him.

354
- Oh, they're hugging.
- Aw.

355
He's taking her purse.

356
Uh, that's not them.
I'm gonna go call the police.

357
- Oh, there they are.
- Where?

358
- Ah!
- Oh.

359
Aw.

360
All right, get a room.

﻿1
- Okay.
- Come on, no peeking.

2
Our eyes are closed, and we're about
to cross the street. Very good.

3
Okay. Open up.

4
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van.

5
Yeah, it's for our catering business.

6
- Oh.
- I think I know that girl.

7
- We're not gonna keep it this way, though.
- No?

8
We're gonna paint over the sword
and replace it with a baguette.

9
Oh.

10
Um, also, we don't know what to do
with this.

11
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.

12
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

13
- Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
- Yeah.

14
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic
for the Chelsea Reporter.

15
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity
to influence...

16
...dozens of people.

17
What about our catering business?

18
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.

19
Plus, I get to take all of you out
for free dinners.

20
- Hey.
- Oh.

21
Well, in that case:

22
- That was me hopping on board.
- Oh.

23
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross.
Quick question for you.

24
Are you ready to party?

25
I don't know, I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

26
But there's this thing about bumblebees
on the Discovery Channel.

27
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?

28
No.

29
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?

30
Kathy's with her parents,
I have nothing to do.

31
Tomorrow we are partying
with Gandalf, dude.

32
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.

33
Wow, okay. Dude alert.

34
And who is this guy?

35
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.

36
I'm gonna call
and get off work tomorrow.

37
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.

38
This is gonna be so cool.
Dude, we never party anymore.

39
Whoo!

40
All right, were you guys
smoking something in the back of our van?

41
What do you mean, we never have fun?
You have fun with me.

42
Remember the time we saw those strippers
and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

43
Joey, you are gonna love this guy.
Gandalf is like the party wizard.

44
- Well, why do you call him Gandalf?
- Gandalf the wizard.

45
Hello? Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

46
No, I had sex in high school.

47
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

48
There's an opening for an assistant buyer
in Junior Miss...

49
Okay, but that would be a step down
for me.

50
No, actually, I meant for me.

51
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

52
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess
you can't stay my assistant forever.

53
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

54
I'm so glad
you don't have a problem with this.

55
If you did,
I wouldn't have considered applying.

56
Really? In that case...

57
And that's why I'm so glad
there's no problem.

58
Yeah, it's fine. I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

59
Oh, that's great.

60
- You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
- Really?

61
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

62
- Really?
- No. Ha, ha.

63
Yeah.

64
- I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha.
- No. Ha, ha.

65
I'm sure with your qualifications,
you won't need to sleep with some guy.

66
Oh. Ha, ha.

67
Although, uh,
I might need some convincing.

68
- Um... Oh.
- Kidding. Ha, ha.

69
- God, I feel wild today.
- Aah!

70
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.

71
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

72
Look, you don't understand.
Gandalf is amazing.

73
You never know what's gonna happen.

74
You go out for a couple of beers and
end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

75
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.

76
Hey. Okay.

77
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

78
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.

79
All right, I'll see you guys.

80
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

81
I have an audition,
but I'll hook up with you later.

82
- Where you gonna be around noon?
- Heh.

83
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

84
Okay.

85
Hello?

86
It's Gandalf.

87
So are you in town?

88
Oh, well...

89
Well, maybe next time, then.

90
What happened?

91
He's not gonna make it.
He's stuck in Chicago.

92
Oh, man.

93
Chicago's so lucky.

94
Stupid, useless Canadian money.

95
You have a very impressive résumé,
Ms. Green.

96
I especially like what I see here
about implementing a new filing system.

97
Thank you.

98
Filing system? Oh, you mean those little
colored labels you put on all the folders?

99
It certainly did brighten up
the inside of the filing cabinets.

100
Well, they, uh... They did more than that.

101
I notice that you've been entrusted
with a lot of important responsibilities.

102
Yes. Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

103
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible
at getting my morning bagel.

104
It's amazing how she gets it right
almost every time.

105
Of course,
I have more responsibilities than that.

106
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.

107
That's, uh, very good.

108
Now, a big part of this job...

109
...is cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

110
- Yes, I realize...
- Rachel shouldn't have any problem.

111
Her only problem might be getting a little
too friendly, if you know what I mean.

112
I love working with designers.

113
With them, under them,
what's the difference, eh, Rach?

114
Hey. My first review is out.

115
Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter.

116
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

117
- All right, look, I'm on the back page.
- Ooh. Oh!

118
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, but I would have to order two meals.

119
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

120
Wow, you really laid into this place.

121
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word
to make friends.

122
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy
who could fix up the van for catering.

123
- Oh. You want me to go with you?
- No, no, it's okay.

124
But are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

125
- Haven't we made this decision?
- Yeah, all right.

126
- Bye.
- Bye.

127
Who is it?

128
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

129
Oh, my God.

130
- I wanna talk to you about your review.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

131
Call me on the phone.

132
What, so you can hang up on me?

133
I'm never gonna let you up,
so you may as well just go away.

134
Just give me a chance to...

135
Do you need to get in? Here you go.

136
- No, Phoebe!
- Oh, hey, Monica.

137
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

138
I couldn't eat it.

139
I have five friends who couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

140
Well, our service is not
"grossly incompetent."

141
The waiter carried the breadsticks
in his pants.

142
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

143
...which we do not.

144
All right, that I'll retract.

145
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

146
Your marinara sauce
tastes like tomato juice.

147
You should serve it with vodka
and a piece of celery.

148
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

149
Oh, my God.

150
You own an Italian restaurant
and you think that tastes good?

151
Where are you even from?

152
Lebanon.

153
Hand me those tomatoes.

154
I'm gonna show you what it should
taste like. Come on, hand them to me.

155
How long is this gonna take?
I got another critic I gotta go yell at.

156
Ahem. Uh, Joanna,
I wanna talk about that interview.

157
I thought it went very well.

158
No, it didn't.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

159
Now, just to brief you...

160
...I may cry.

161
But they are not tears of sadness
or of anger...

162
...but just of me having this discussion
with you.

163
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.

164
There's nobody here.

165
Sophie, get in here.

166
You see?
Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.

167
She's not making me uncomfortable.

168
Congratulations, you've just crossed
the line into completely useless. Get out.

169
Do you want me to quit?

170
What? What would make you think that?

171
Well, all of those things you said
in the interview.

172
If you believe any of them,
I must not be a very good assistant.

173
You know what?

174
I am just going to pack up my desk...

175
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

176
Well, I guess there's no use me
sticking around till the end of the day.

177
Wait, wait, wait.

178
You can put your sad little muffin
back in its drawer.

179
If you must know the truth,
I didn't wanna lose a good assistant.

180
What?

181
That's why I said all those things
about your flirting and your drinking.

182
My drinking?

183
Oh. I must have said that after you left.

184
Said what, exactly?

185
That you enjoy the occasional drink...

186
...- ing binge.

187
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.

188
- You are just a horrible person.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

189
Now, if you're gonna get
all sensitive about it.

190
I don't want to lose you.

191
What if I create a position for you?

192
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

193
- Say more things like that.
- Um...

194
You can have your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

195
- I'd need an expense account.
- Done.

196
- And an assistant.
- Sophie, get in here.

197
Now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?
Starting from...

198
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

199
I thought you'd be partying
with Gandoldorf.

200
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

201
- So you've been sitting here all morning?
- No.

202
I balanced my checkbook.

203
Yeah, and I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

204
I can't believe he didn't come.

205
So what if he didn't come?
We can still go out and party ourselves.

206
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf,
we'd be out all night.

207
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

208
Well, we could do that.

209
There was other stuff too.

210
We'll do it all, and better.

211
Look, after tonight,
Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.

212
Come on.

213
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

214
- It's not like we don't know how to party.
- Yeah. All right. Let's go.

215
And maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

216
- Yeah!
- All right!

217
Ah!

218
Hey, hey, hey. When were we on a boat?

219
Remember that really cold morning...

220
...when you woke up
and those dogs were licking your face?

221
- Yeah.
- Those were seals, man.

222
Hey, how do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer...?

223
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me...

224
...but I made him some sauce,
and he offered me the job as head chef.

225
Oh, my God.

226
You just ruined the thing I was practicing
the whole way home, but I'm so happy.

227
Can you believe it?
I finally get to run my own kitchen.

228
Oh, you've waited so long.

229
- Ha, ha, oh.
- Oh.

230
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you.

231
How do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

232
I don't know. It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

233
- You got the job!
- Yes!

234
Oh! You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

235
Oh. It's gonna be so great.
I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.

236
I'm gonna have an office
with walls and everything.

237
- I'm gonna have walls.
- Aw.

238
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

239
The wedding reception.

240
Oh.

241
Um, Phoebe,
I kind of need to talk to you about that.

242
Um...

243
Well, I think it might be time for me
to take a step back from the catering.

244
- But we've only had one job.
- Tsk.

245
I know, but now we have this second one,
and it just feels like it's snowballing.

246
Yeah, what are you saying?

247
I got offered the head-chef job
at Allesandro's.

248
- What?
- It's okay, you don't really need me.

249
You're the cook.

250
Without you,
it's just me driving up to people's houses...

251
...with empty trays and asking for money.

252
All right.

253
But, um, well, I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

254
- And you can keep the van.
- For what?

255
I can't believe this.
I gotta get out of here.

256
Phoebe, wait a minute.

257
I'm an assistant buyer!

258
All right, we'll get a little coffee,
get energized, then we'll head back out.

259
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay.

260
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.

261
We hit a couple of clubs,
talked to some strangers...

262
...then after this, we'll go down
to the docks and see about that boat thing.

263
I'm kind of beat.

264
Actually...

265
...me too.

266
Are you serious?

267
Yeah.

268
Thank God. I'm exhausted.

269
So you guys want coffees?

270
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

271
Yeah, me too.

272
Actually, could I get some hot water
with a little lemon?

273
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

274
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying,
my ears are ringing so bad.

275
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair
of socks, you know?

276
I used them as mittens.

277
I didn't wanna touch a thing
in that last place.

278
Oh.

279
How sad are we?

280
Yeah, I know.

281
You know what? We're not sad.

282
We're not sad,
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?

283
I'm 29 years old, damn it.

284
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair,
watch television...

285
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

286
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

287
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

288
Yeah.

289
And so what if I like to go home,
throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?

290
We're 29. We're not women.

291
Oh. There you are.

292
Hey, I'm glad that you decided
to hear me out.

293
Okay, I'm hearing.

294
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

295
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of
businesses that you can do with your van.

296
Okay, um...

297
- You could be a flower delivery person.
- What?

298
Or a bakery delivery person.

299
Pizza?

300
Monica.

301
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff
in this area...

302
...but I'm getting the feeling
you don't wanna deliver.

303
- No.
- Okay.

304
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

305
...you probably don't wanna
pick up stuff either.

306
No.

307
You know what?

308
- Let's do the catering business.
- Really? Are you sure?

309
Yeah. You know,
I made a commitment to you.

310
- Know what? It'd be fun.
- Oh, it will be fun.

311
- Oh. Yay!
- Aw.

312
Okay. Ooh, let's plan
the wedding reception. Okay.

313
Wow.

314
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

315
You know what?
I want you to take the chefjob.

316
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
That's what you really want.

318
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason
you're unhappy.

319
That would make me unhappy.

320
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

321
Thank you.

322
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

323
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

324
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

325
Heard what?

326
Joanna passed away last night.

327
Oh, my God. How?

328
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

329
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

330
- I know.
- Oh, God.

331
Oh, God.

332
I didn't realize that you were so close.

333
Yes. So close.

334
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

335
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

336
...before it happened?

337
No, nothing.

338
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later...

339
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

340
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

341
I'm sorry. I have to go.

342
Good morning.

343
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

344
I sure did.

345
I'm so excited about having Monica
come on board with us.

346
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

347
It is like losing a member of the family.

348
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

349
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

350
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

351
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

352
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

353
So without much further ado...

354
...I present to you our new head chef.

355
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

356
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

357
...we can have the recipe...

358
Are you going to kill me?

﻿1
Friends, family,
we're gathered to celebrate here today...

2
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

3
Now Ross, repeat after me.

4
I, Ross.

5
I, Ross.

6
Take thee, Emily.

7
Take thee, Rachel.

8
Emily.

9
Heh. Emily.

10
Uh, shall I go on?

11
He said "Rachel," right?

12
Do you think I should go up there?

13
Yes. Yes. Do go on.

14
I think we'd better start again.

15
Ross, repeat after me.

16
I, Ross.

17
Take thee, Emily.

18
Ha, ha. Like there'd be anybody else.

19
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

20
...till death parts us.

21
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...

22
...until death parts us.

23
Really, I do. Emily.

24
Do you have the rings?

25
Emily, place this ring on Ross' finger...

26
...as a symbol of your bond everlasting.

27
Ross, place this ring...

28
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...

29
...of the love that encircles you forever.

30
Happy to.

31
They have made their declarations...

32
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.

33
You may kiss the bride.

34
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.

35
Just keep smiling.

36
Okay...

37
Well, that went well. Yeah.

38
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.

39
Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

40
You spoiled everything.
It's like a nightmare.

41
All my friends and family are out there.
How can I face them?

42
How could you do this to me?

43
Hey, no matter what happens
with Ross and Emily...

44
...we still get cake, right?

45
That's all right.
No, no. You take your time, sweetie.

46
I'll be out here. Ha, ha.

47
She's just fixing her makeup.

48
I hate you.

49
And I love you.

50
Boy, a bad time
to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?

51
That's true. Thanks, Dad.

52
People should be dancing, huh?

53
Hey, this is a party. Come on.

54
Joey. Dance.

55
Yes, Waltham Interiors.

56
Hello, this is Ross Geller's
personal physician, Dr. Phalange.

57
Who?

58
Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.

59
Um, now, without it, uh,
in the brain of Ross...

60
...uh, women's names are interchangeable.

61
Through no fault of his own.

62
Oh, my God. Phoebe.

63
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.

64
Oh, no. You have it too.

65
Hello?

66
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
Wow, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

68
...but I know we had plans
to meet up tonight and...

69
Ugh. I'm just kind of worried
about what it might do to our friendship.

70
I know.

71
- Ugh. How could we have let this happen?
- Seven times.

72
You know, look. We were away.

73
- In a foreign, romantic country.
- Right.

74
I blame London.

75
Bad London.

76
So look, um...

77
...while we're still in London,
I mean, we can keep doing it, right?

78
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.

79
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.

80
Only here.

81
You know,
I saw a wine cellar downstairs.

82
- I'll meet you there in two minutes.
- Okay.

83
- Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something.
- Now?

84
Ross said my name up there.
I mean, come on.

85
I can't just pretend that didn't happen.

86
I don't know.

87
- Monica, what should I do?
- Just do the right thing.

88
What?

89
Tow the line. Thread the needle.
Think outside the box.

90
Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.

91
Wait. Rachel, no.

92
He's married.

93
Married.

94
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.

95
Okay. You're right.

96
You're right. You can't help me.

97
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?

98
Yes.

99
Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?

100
I mean,
how are you supposed to eat this?

101
Hey, what's up?

102
Where were you?
We were supposed to meet.

103
- Forget it. That's off.
- Why?

104
The next tour of the wine cellar...

105
...will commence in two minutes.

106
Joey, what are you doing?

107
You promised Phoebe
no meat till she has the babies.

108
Well, I figured we're in another country,
so it doesn't count.

109
- That's true.
- The man's got a point.

110
Oh, hi.

111
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
I'm sorry things
aren't working out so well.

113
Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better.
It's gonna be okay, right?

114
Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean,
she's gonna get over this, you know?

115
I mean, so you said my name.

116
You know, you just said it
because you saw me there.

117
If you'd seen a circus freak,
you would've said:

118
I take thee Circus Freak.

119
It didn't mean anything.
It's just a mistake.

120
It didn't mean anything.

121
- Right?
- No, no.

122
Of course it didn't mean anything.

123
I mean, I can understand why Emily
would think it meant something...

124
...you know, because it was you.

125
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't! It didn't!

126
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside
for your first dance with Emily.

127
Oh. Oh, the band's ready.

128
Well, we got to do what the band says.

129
I don't care about the stupid band!

130
You spit on me, man.

131
I'm sorry.

132
- Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh?
- Heh.

133
When I locked myself in the bathroom
at my wedding...

134
...it was because I was trying
to pop the window out of the frame.

135
- Right.
- Get the hell out of there. You know?

136
Emily.

137
I'm coming in.

138
Oh, look at that. Same thing.

139
In the middle of everything...

140
...if I scream the word "yippee,"
just ignore me.

141
- Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel.
- Oh, hello, Rachel.

142
Ross said my name.

143
Okay? My name.

144
Ross said my name up there.

145
That obviously means
that he still loves me.

146
Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.

147
All right. Do you guys want to go
and get a drink?

148
Yes, we do.

149
But we have to change first.

150
Yes, I want to change.

151
- Why don't you go get a table?
- We'll be down in five minutes.

152
- Fifteen minutes.
- Ha, ha.

153
Hello.

154
Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.

155
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Oh, great.

156
Hi.

157
So, what happened?

158
Well, Ross said my name.

159
Yeah, I know,
but I don't think that means anything.

160
Okay, Pheebs,
let's look at this objectively.

161
All right, ninth grade, right?

162
The obsession starts.

163
All right? Summer after ninth grade...

164
...he sees me in a two-piece
for the first time.

165
His obsession begins to grow, right?

166
Hey, listen, why don't we go change
in my room?

167
My clothes are... Oh.

168
- Wow, you look...
- No time for that.

169
Okay.

170
Hey, dude. Let me in.
I got a girl out here.

171
Well, I've got a girl in here.

172
No, you don't.
I just saw you go in there with Monica.

173
Well, we're hanging out in here.

174
Which one of us is gonna be
having sex in there? Me or you?

175
Well, I suppose I would have to say you.

176
- What if we're watching a movie in here?
- Which we are.

177
And we've already paid for it.
It's My Giant.

178
My Giant? I love that movie.

179
You really think this is okay?

180
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.

181
Oh, it's so beautiful.

182
Oh.

183
You know, I don't feel right about this.

184
Oh, Monica...

185
This is the honeymoon suite.

186
The room expects sex.

187
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.

188
All the other honeymoon suites
would think it was a loser.

189
Okay.

190
- Emily?
- Nope. Not under here.

191
- You didn't find her?
- No, I've looked everywhere.

192
Well, you couldn't have,
or else you would've found her.

193
- I think you should keep looking.
- Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?

194
Or 45?

195
Wow, in 45 minutes,
you could find her twice.

196
No. For all I know,
she's trying to find me...

197
...but couldn't because
I kept moving around.

198
No, from now on,
I'm staying in one place.

199
Right here.

200
- It's getting late.
- Yeah, We're going to go.

201
Actually...

202
...do you guys mind
staying here for a while?

203
Ugh. You know, we got to get up early
and catch that plane to New York.

204
Yeah, it's a very large plane.

205
That's cool.

206
But we'll stay here with you.

207
Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.

208
I really appreciate this, you know,
but you don't need to rub my butt.

209
We have to leave for New York
in an hour.

210
I know. I've been looking at those doors.

211
They look pretty soundproof,
don't you think?

212
We can't do that. That's insane.

213
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...

214
...let's go for it.

215
Emily? Emily.

216
- Emily!
- Nope.

217
- Forget about Emily. She's not with us.
- We've come for her things.

218
Where is she?

219
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you ever again.

220
We're very sad that it didn't work out
between you and Emily, monkey.

221
But I think you're absolutely delicious.

222
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

223
Oh, yes.

224
There you are.

225
Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some.
There's a whole cart outside.

226
- Goodbye, Geller.
- Now, hold on. Hold on.

227
Look, look. Your daughter and I...

228
...are supposed to leave tonight
for our honeymoon.

229
Now, you tell her that
I'm gonna be at that airport...

230
...and I hope that she'll be there too.

231
Yeah, I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.

232
She's just a friend. That's all.
Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...

233
...and that I can't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

234
Please, promise me that
you'll tell her that.

235
All right, I'll tell her.

236
Come on, bugger face.

237
Call me.

238
You spend half your life in the bathroom.

239
Why do you never go out
the bloody window?

240
Well, maybe it's best
we never got to do it again.

241
Yeah, it kind of makes
that one night special.

242
You know, technically,
we still are over international waters.

243
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?

244
Okay.

245
Hey, can I ask you something?

246
Uh, no.

247
Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant.
And I was thinking...

248
...I'm never gonna be as good an actor
as that giant.

249
Do you think I'm just wasting my life
with this acting thing?

250
No.

251
I mean, the giant's like five years
younger than me.

252
You know, you think I'll ever get there?

253
Yes.

254
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, man.

255
But what about how much taller
he is than me?

256
I mean, there's no way
I can make myself taller now.

257
And who knows what science
will come up with in the future...

258
...but, Chandler, what if I die
an unsuccessful, regular-size man?

259
Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been
in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.

260
I know.

261
Had the beef tips, huh?

262
Hey.

263
You ate meat!

264
You had sex!

265
- No, we didn't.
- I know you didn't.

266
I was talking about Monica.

267
Phoebe, I did not have sex.

268
Oh, this pregnancy
is throwing me all off.

269
- I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck.
- Oh, me too.

270
Why would you need to say hi?
You've been feeding them for four days.

271
Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.

272
Well, we certainly are alone.

273
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.

274
Right.

275
Um, listen, since we're on that subject...

276
...um, I just wanted to tell you that,
um...

277
Well, I was going through
a really hard time in London...

278
...what with my brother getting married
and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.

279
Right.

280
Well, anyway, I just...

281
That night meant a lot to me.
And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.

282
Oh.

283
You know,
that night meant a lot to me too.

284
And it wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.

285
It just meant a lot to me
because you're really hot.

286
- Is that okay?
- Ha, ha. That's okay.

287
And I'm cute too?

288
- And you're cute too.
- Thank you.

289
- All right, I got to go unpack.
- Okay.

290
Bye.

291
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

292
- Oh, that counts.
- Oh, good.

293
Rach.

294
- Rach.
- Hi.

295
What are you doing here?

296
Well, I've been on standby
for a flight home for hours.

297
- Oh.
- Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?

298
Not yet.

299
So, um...

300
What time are you supposed to leave?

301
This is the last call
for Flight 1066 to Athens.

302
The last call.

303
Pretty soon, I guess.

304
I'm sorry.

305
I just... I don't understand.
I mean, how could she do this?

306
What, am I like a complete idiot...

307
...for thinking she'd actually show up?

308
No.

309
You're not an idiot, Ross.

310
You're a guy very much in love.

311
Same difference.

312
All passengers for Flight 1066
to Athens should now be on board.

313
I get it!

314
Well, that's that.

315
No, you know what?

316
I think you should go.

317
- What?
- Yeah, I do think you should go...

318
...by yourself. Get some distance.

319
Clear your head.
I think it would be really good.

320
Oh, I don't know.

321
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think it would be really good for you.

322
I could. I could do that.

323
Yeah.

324
I can't even believe her.

325
You know what? I am going to go.

326
- Good.
- Why not?

327
- Right?
- Right. Right.

328
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll see you back at home.

329
If I ever get a flight out of here.

330
Hey, well...

331
- No.
- What? Wait, what?

332
Why don't you come?

333
I mean, I have two tickets. Why not?

334
Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?

335
Yeah, yeah. It'd be great.
I mean, you can...

336
You can lay on the beach...

337
...and I can cry over my failed marriage.

338
- You see how I make jokes?
- Uh-huh.

339
Really. I mean...

340
God, I could use a friend.

341
Oh, wow. Okay, maybe.

342
Um...

343
Yes, I can do that.

344
- Cool.
- All right, cool.

345
Okay, we're going to Greece. Yeah, okay.

346
Aah, aah. I forgot my jacket.

347
- Well, you tell them to wait.
- Okay.

348
- Wait. Wait.
- Okay.

349
Emily.

350
Oh, no, no, no.

351
No! No!

352
Emily!

353
Ah, yes. I will have a glass
of the Merlot...

354
...and he will have a white-wine spritzer.

355
Whoo!

356
Huh.

357
Hey, look at that. The airport's moving.

358
Hey, are we moving?

359
Are we moving? Why are we moving?

360
They... Um...

361
Yeah, does the captain know
that we're moving?

362
Oh, my gosh.

﻿1
- What are you doing?
- I reorganized the fridge, heh.

2
See?
Uh, bottom shelf, meats and dairy.

3
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

4
And top shelf, expired products.

5
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I am bored out of my mind.

6
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

7
Dude, you just described
seven days worth of stuff.

8
Gotta spread it out a little, you know.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

9
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

10
Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?

11
A guy in your position needs to be
a little better at relaxing, you know.

12
Why do you think we have
the comfortable chairs, huh? Here, sit down.

13
Ready? Watch.

14
Aw!

15
And then...

16
Aw, yeah! Huh?

17
- So, what? We just sit?
- Oh, no, no.

18
We're not gonna just sit. Watch.

19
Shh.

20
Hello. Chandler Bing.

21
Hello, Mr. Bing.

22
I love you.

23
All right, whoever this is,
stop calling me.

24
It's been six months! It's not funny!

25
But I love you.

26
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!

27
And that's Wednesday. Ah!

28
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

29
The British are coming?

30
Oh, you and your ways.

31
Since it's Christmas, I'm gonna be
one of those people collecting donations.

32
Yeah. I already have my bell,
and later on I get my bucket.

33
Oh.

34
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be spreading joy to the people.

35
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.

36
So this year, I'm gonna do the whole city.
Heh.

37
I knew a girl in high school
who did that. She was very popular.

38
Uh, so, Pheebs, where are you
doing your bell ringing?

39
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

40
They never give such a good corner
to a rookie...

41
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

42
I lied.

43
Oh, my God. Okay, you guys, here's Danny.

44
Just watch this.

45
See? Still pretending he's not interested.

46
Okay, he's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

47
- Hey, guys.
PHOEBE, CHANDLER & MONICA: Hey, Danny.

48
Oh, Danny! Hey!

49
Oh, uh...

50
Danny, you know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

51
- Thanks, Mon.
- Of course.

52
- Do you wanna go out on a date with her?
- Monica.

53
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

54
Oh, my God.

55
Friday is perfect. She can't wait.

56
On the date, I will be able
to talk to her directly, right?

57
See you Friday.

58
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

59
I have a date with Danny. Ha!

60
How could I not get the part?

61
The play was about a 29-year-old
Italian actor from Queens.

62
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

63
She's a woman!

64
What can I say? She nailed it.

65
Uh, okay. Is there anything else?

66
Well, you're just gonna say no again, but...

67
...gay porn?

68
Happy holidays!

69
And Merry Christmas.

70
Oh, thank you, sir. Here's some joy.

71
- Hey.
- How's it going?

72
Well, it's going okay.

73
- Oh, good. Here, let me help you out.
- Oh, thanks.

74
- Yeah.
- Wow. Ha, ha.

75
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.

76
Yeah. I guess.

77
Just get your nails done?

78
Yes, Phoebe,
but this is all I have, okay?

79
Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.

80
- Here's your joy.
- Thank you.

81
Thank you. Happy holidays and...
Wait.

82
- You can't take the money out.
- I'm making change for the bus.

83
Can't you leave the dollar?
This money's for the poor.

84
I'm poor. I gotta take the bus.

85
Okay. Seasons greetings and everything.
But still...

86
Bite me, blondie!

87
Oh!

88
Oh, I'm gonna give him
something besides joy. Just...

89
That part was perfect for me.
I can't believe I didn't get it.

90
I'm sorry, man.

91
You know what you should do?

92
You should make something happen
for yourself.

93
You know, like write a play.

94
Write a movie, huh? What about
those Good Will Hunting guys?

95
Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...

96
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?

97
- Wait a second. I could star in it!
- Or that.

98
I can't write, you know. I mean, I'm an actor.

99
I don't have the discipline
that it takes, you know. I can't do it.

100
I'll help you.

101
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

102
Plus it'll give me something to do.

103
- Really? You'd do that for me? Thanks.
- Yeah.

104
We'll start off slow.
The only thing you have to do tonight...

105
...is come up with the name
of your main character.

106
- Done.
- And it can't be Joey.

107
- It's not.
- Or Joseph.

108
Oh.

109
Hi. What's up?

110
I just saw Danny getting on the subway
with a girl...

111
...and he had his arm around her.

112
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

113
Well, you should be. This is all your fault.

114
You meddled in our relationship.

115
You had no relationship.

116
No, but I was doing my thing,
and everything...

117
...was going according to the plan!

118
Oh, God. Stop with the plan.

119
Unh. So what
if you saw him with a girl?

120
Who cares?
That doesn't mean anything.

121
You'll go out on a date with Danny and
be so charming he'll forget all about...

122
...that stupid subway girl.

123
She was kind of stupid.

124
You're right. All right.
I'm just gonna go on the date.

125
I'm just gonna go on the date.
That is the new plan.

126
Hurry, hurry!

127
Mm.

128
- Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"?
- Why?

129
Because I think this character
is gonna be suspicious about stuff.

130
Yes!

131
Chandler Bing, seven,
Chandler Bing, zero.

132
You're driving me crazy with that.

133
- Okay, I'll stop.
- No, don't stop.

134
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

135
Well, you suck. But at least
you suck at a man's game now.

136
- You wanna play?
- I can't be playing games.

137
Ross will be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.

138
Well, so play for the next 30 minutes,
then you can write until he gets home.

139
All right.

140
But, listen,
what do you say we, uh...

141
...crank it up a notch?

142
I'm intrigued.

143
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

144
Okay, but be careful.
I wanna get our security deposit back.

145
Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

146
Do you remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

147
Uh, yeah, right here.

148
Thank you. Happy holiday.

149
No, that's trash, young lady.
No, you can't...

150
Hey. Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

151
Hey.

152
The charity's on fire!

153
Help! Good, thank you. I need that.

154
Whoo!

155
What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.

156
All right. "A room.

157
A man enters. He looks suspicious."

158
That's it?

159
Joey, you were supposed to
have five pages done by now...

160
...including an exciting incident.

161
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

162
Yeah, that's the game we played.

163
Yeah, it's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl...

164
Oh, oh.

165
This is helping your career, huh?
You wanted to be an actor.

166
Not the creator of
Crazy Lawsuit Game.

167
You're right, you're right.
I'll get back to work.

168
And shame on you. You should know better.
Joey needs to work.

169
- Now come on.
- Hey.

170
No, uh-uh. You can have this back
when the five pages are done, huh?

171
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- So did I.

172
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

173
I'd love to ask you in
but my sister's visiting.

174
- I think she's asleep on the couch.
- Your sister?

175
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

176
Ah, I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch.

177
Oh, God!

178
- Oh, I thought I heard you.
- Oh, hey, great, you're up.

179
Rachel, my sister Krista.
Krista, Rachel.

180
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

181
Wish you told me we were having
company. I'd have fixed myself.

182
- Like it would help.
- You are so bad.

183
- You are.
- You are.

184
- You are. You are.
- You are. You are!

185
- You are so dead.
- Ha.

186
- I'm gonna get you. Come here.
- Aah!

187
- Come here. Come here!
- Ha-ha-ha!

188
Um, it's very nice to meet you.

189
Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.

190
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here.

191
Look. Okay, does this look like...

192
...a garbage can to you?
- No.

193
- Does it look like an ashtray?
- No.

194
Does it look like a urinal?

195
Ew!

196
- So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there?
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.

197
Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

198
Yeah, good for you. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

199
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
to being Street Phoebe.

200
Yeah. Oh, but you know what?
I can't go totally back...

201
...because Street Phoebe really
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

202
- Hey.
- Hey.

203
- Um, can I ask you guys something?
- Sure.

204
Um, I don't have any brothers so I don't
know, but did you guys wrestle?

205
- Oh, yeah.
- All the time.

206
In fact, I was undefeated.

207
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

208
Still, I was quick as a cat.

209
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.

210
- Uh, that was the girl on the subway.
- Oh, you're kidding.

211
And they were very, you know...

212
...wrestle-y.

213
But I guess that's normal?

214
We don't wrestle now.

215
Not since I got
too strong for you. Ha, ha.

216
- Too strong for me?
- Yeah.

217
You wanna go right now?

218
Because I'll take you right now, buddy.
You wanna go?

219
Oh, fine.

220
Ready?

221
Wrestle!

222
Okay, you know what, um?

223
Actually, that's great. That helps a lot.
Thanks.

224
Guys, come on, let's go.
The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on.

225
- Joey's not going.
- I didn't finish my five pages.

226
Why can't you finish them tomorrow?

227
Because tomorrow
he's redoing yesterday's pages.

228
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

229
Why don't you cut him a little slack?
Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.

230
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

231
...and Fireball.

232
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you obviously have never played.

233
The only reason you're doing
this to Joey is you're bored.

234
It's not his fault that you're unemployed.

235
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

236
Look, look. Guys, don't fight.

237
And the reason I'm doing this
is because I am Joey's friend.

238
And if you were a good friend,
you'd be doing the same thing.

239
So being a good friend
means acting like a jerk?

240
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

241
Hey, guys. How about we settle this
over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?

242
- I'll go unhook the smoke detectors.
- How about we settle this right now?

243
There. Now no one's going
to the game. Ha-ha-ha.

244
- I paid for those tickets.
- No, you didn't.

245
- You said you would, but you never did.
- Oh, yeah.

246
So we finally get
to the top of the mountain, ahem...

247
...and airhead here forgets the camera.

248
You know, that same thing
happened to me one time.

249
When did that happen to you?

250
Don't you remember? We were jogging
in the park, we saw that pretty bird.

251
And I wanted to take a picture
but I didn't have my camera.

252
Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy
is not jogging.

253
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

254
Hmm. Mm.

255
That is good.

256
- Oh, damn. I got it on my pants.
- Here, I'll get it.

257
Mm.

258
We better take these off
or that stain will set.

259
- I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight.
- Oh, great.

260
Okay, bye. Oh, my God.

261
- That was unbelievable.
- Okay, see? I told you.

262
- Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rach.
- I don't believe they're brother and sister.

263
They're brother and sister?

264
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

265
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

266
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

267
What's this? A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!

268
Gosh.

269
Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.

270
Set it down over there
and then you can make a contribution.

271
And you can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.

272
Hi, Bob.
I thought I told you to get out of here!

273
Uh, Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

274
And we're gonna move you
to a less high-profile spot.

275
What?

276
- Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
- That chick can't handle my corner.

277
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

278
Fine.

279
All right, I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

280
- Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7.
- Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.

281
What? Uh, why?

282
Um... Look.

283
You and your sister seem to have, um,
a very special bond...

284
Oh, great. That "special bond" again.

285
Why do women have such a problem
with the fact that I'm close with my sister?

286
- Okay, look, I don't know, but...
- Do you have brothers?

287
No, I have two sisters, but one of them
actually has a very masculine energy.

288
- Are you close with them?
- No, no. They're not very nice people.

289
Okay, come here. Listen.

290
I really like you, okay?
I think this could go somewhere.

291
So what if I'm close to my family?
You gonna let that stand in the way of us?

292
Well, I... I don't know...

293
See, when you put it that way, you know...

294
Danny, hurry up. The bath's getting cold.

295
- What?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.

296
Oh, hey. There's some kids
playing in the street.

297
You wanna go down there,
give them a project, ruin their day?

298
Hey, if they have a ball,
maybe you could stick razor blades in it...

299
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

300
Hey, guys. I was at the library all morning
and I already finished my five pages for today.

301
Great. Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night.

302
No, dude. Ross tore up the tickets.

303
I guess when you don't have so many
distractions, it's easier for you to focus, huh?

304
Yeah, or also when you don't have somebody
breathing down your neck all the livelong day!

305
Well, that's fine, but the important thing
is I finished it. And I think it's really good.

306
But you know what would help me, is if
I could hear it. Would you guys read it for me?

307
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

308
Okay.
"It's a typical New York City apartment.

309
Two guys are hanging out." Ross?

310
- "Hey, man."
- "What is up?"

311
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."

312
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."

313
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter...

314
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."

315
"Could I be more sorry?"

316
"I don't know. I am one sorry...

317
...polontologist."

318
All right, Joey, we get it.

319
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

320
Oh, no, no, no. Keep reading.
The good part's coming up. Keep going.

321
"I am sorry, Chandler."

322
"I am sorry, Ross."

323
Ahem. "A handsome man enters."

324
"Hey. How's it going, guys?

325
I don't know what you two are talking about,
but I'd just like to say thanks to both of you.

326
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.

327
And you. Well, you co-created Fireball.

328
The End." Yeah.

329
This took you all day?

330
No, no, this only took five minutes.

331
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with New Ultimate Fireball. Ha, ha!

332
Okay. "It's a typical New York apartment.

333
Two girls are just hanging out." Go.

334
- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
- "I'm doing just fine.

335
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

336
"It's my new perfume.

337
Why don't you come closer
where you can really appreciate it?"

338
- Oh, you know, Joey, you are sick.
- This is disgusting.

339
I'm not reading this.

340
What? Wait, wait, wait.
The handsome man was about to enter!

﻿1
Is there any entertainment there?

2
All right. Here we go.
1999, the year of Joey.

3
We're very happy for you.

4
What's the matter?

5
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but
nobody else is going to so, you know...

6
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Oh, no.

7
Joey.

8
- Thirty-three, 32, 31.
- Ross, Ross, Ross.

9
Listen, who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

10
- What?
- Well, you gotta kiss someone.

11
- Can't kiss your sister.
- Who's gonna kiss my sister?

12
- Chandler.
- Oh, man. Really?

13
Who would you rather have
kiss your sister?

14
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

15
Uh, well, since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

16
Okay, great. Pheebs, Pheebs. Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

17
So obvious. Why doesn't he just ask?

18
Rach, Rach.
Listen, I'm going to kiss you at midnight.

19
- What?
- You can't kiss Ross. You got the history.

20
- So?
- So?

21
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?
- Oh, good point.

22
Three, two, one.

23
Happy New Year!

24
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

25
- Happy New Year, Pheebs.
- You too.

26
Happy New Year, Joey.

27
So that do anything for you?

28
You know what?

29
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say, "No divorces in '99."

30
But your divorce isn't even final yet.

31
Just the one divorce in '99.

32
You know what?
I'm gonna be happy this year.

33
I'm gonna make myself happy.

34
Do you want us to leave the room or?

35
Every day, I am going to do one thing
I have never done before.

36
That, my friends,
is my New Year's resolution.

37
- Ooh. That's a good one.
- Yeah?

38
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

39
That's a good one too. Now you
only have to find a planeload of people...

40
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

41
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

42
Especially the ones who may soon be
flying you to Europe for free...

43
...on their own plane.

44
She has a better chance of sprouting wings
and flying up your nose...

45
...than you do of not making fun of us.

46
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go
the whole year without making fun of us.

47
You know what? Better yet, a week.

48
I'll take that bet, my friend.

49
And you know what?
Paying me the 50 bucks can be...

50
...the "new thing you do" that day.

51
And it starts right now.

52
All right, my New Year's resolution
is to learn how to play guitar.

53
- Really? How come?
- Ah.

54
You know those special skills
I have listed on my résumé?

55
I would love it if one of those was true.

56
Do you want me to teach you?
I'm a great teacher.

57
Really? Who have you taught?

58
Well, I taught me and I loved me.

59
That'd be great. Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.

60
Oh, look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

61
She's gonna be needing these
to keep an eye on that boyfriend.

62
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

63
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I'm talking about.

64
Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution
should be to, um, gossip less.

65
What? I don't gossip.

66
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

67
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

68
You know, kind of like a public service.

69
Doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean,
would you call Ted Koppel a gossip?

70
Well, if Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs...

71
...yeah, I would.

72
Well, they were like this.

73
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

74
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
I just asked that girl out.

76
- Nice.
- Nice. Yeah.

77
Is that part of your resolution,
your "new thing" for today?

78
Yes, it is. See?

79
"Elizabeth...

80
...Hornswoggle"?

81
That's right.

82
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

83
Hornswoggle.

84
You okay, Chandler? Is there something...?

85
Something funny about that name?

86
No, no, I just think that maybe
I've heard it somewhere before.

87
Oh, really? Where?

88
Somewhere funny I'll bet.

89
- Hey, Pheebs. Guess what?
- Hey.

90
Uh, I have a date
with, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

91
Hornswoggle?

92
Oh, this must be killing you.

93
- All right, see you later.
- See you.

94
All right, Pheebs, I am ready
for my first lesson.

95
Okay. Oh, no, no,
you don't touch the guitar.

96
No, no. First you learn here,
then you learn here.

97
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

98
- Okay. Lesson One: Chords.
- Ah.

99
Now, um, I don't know
the actual names of the chords, um...

100
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

101
So then, this is "Bear Claw."

102
Okay, "Turkey Leg"...

103
...and "Old Lady."

104
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction.

105
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

106
Hey, everybody.

107
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

108
I didn't. Even when I found out, um...

109
All right, let's just say I found out
something about someone...

110
...and let's just say...

111
...she's gonna keep it.

112
Hey, Pheebs. Check this out.

113
Ooh. You nailed the Old Lady. Oh!

114
Oh, ha, ha!

115
Hey, listen,
I thought I was getting better...

116
...so on my way home today
I stopped by this guitar store...

117
Did you touch any of the guitars
while you were there?

118
Did you?

119
No.

120
Give me your hands.

121
Strings.

122
Pick.

123
Do you want to learn to play guitar?

124
- Yes.
- Then don't touch one!

125
- Hi.
- Hi.

126
- Hi, Ben.
- Auntie Monica.

127
Aw.

128
Ross is wearing leather pants.

129
Does nobody else see
that Ross is wearing leather pants?

130
Someone comment on the pants.

131
- I think they're very nice.
- I really like them a lot.

132
Not what I had in mind.

133
See, people like Ross
don't generally wear these types of pants.

134
You see, they're very tight.

135
Maybe there's something in that area?

136
- I think they look really good.
- I like them.

137
Yeah, where did you get them?

138
See, I needed a new thing for today.

139
And there's this leather store I go by
that always smells so good.

140
And I thought to myself,
"Wow. You know, I've never owned...

141
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

142
Oh, come on.

143
Okay, seriously. What do you think?

144
- You look like a freak. Yeah, awful.
- Awful.

145
Hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

146
- It's my New Year's resolution.
- To blind my child?

147
No, to take more pictures
of all of us together.

148
I really think it's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

149
Well, everyone will enjoy my music
as well.

150
My God, these pants. I'm burning up.

151
Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now?
What, is she trying to kill me?

152
It's like a volcano in here.

153
- Are you hot?
- No.

154
Okay, it must just be me then.

155
That was just the pants and the couch.

156
Um, hey, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

157
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thanks.

158
Ah.

159
Hey, my favorite part's coming up.

160
Okay.

161
Oh, my God!

162
Tiger. Dragon.

163
Iceberg.

164
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

165
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- Then do Iceberg.

166
- G-sharp.
- G-sharp?

167
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

168
Have you?

169
Oh, my God.

170
What? I didn't touch a guitar.

171
No, but you're questioning my method.

172
No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe.
I'm saying it's stupid.

173
What?

174
Thank you.

175
You know, none of my other student...

176
...thought I was stupid.

177
Your other student was you!

178
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe you just need to try a little harder.

179
Maybe I need to try a real teacher.

180
Right here. Here. Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

181
And look.
Ooh, there's a picture of him with a kid.

182
Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!

183
Fine. You go learn from
your qualified instructor.

184
But don't come crying to me
when everyone is sick and tired...

185
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown."

186
Baddest man in the whole damn town

187
Oh, fine. Take his side.

188
Hmm.

189
I can't wait to be with you.

190
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben.

191
I'll tell Rachel I'm gonna be
doing laundry for a couple hours.

192
Laundry. Huh.
Is that my new nickname?

193
Aw.

194
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

195
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.

196
Uh, Chandler's not here.

197
Well, you can help me.

198
- Okay.
- Listen.

199
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

200
Nice.

201
No, I got really hot in my leather pants
so I took them off.

202
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat or something.

203
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

204
I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't.

205
Oh. That is quite a situation.

206
Uh, do you see any, like, powder?

207
Powder. Yeah, yeah, I have powder.

208
Good, good. Okay.

209
Sprinkle some on your legs.
It'll absorb moisture.

210
Then you can get your pants back on.

211
Yeah, hold on.

212
They're not coming on, man.

213
Um, you see any...? Oh, Vaseline?

214
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

215
- Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there.
- Hold on.

216
Ross, you okay?

217
They're still not coming on, man.

218
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

219
Really?

220
Uh, what color is it?

221
What difference does that make?

222
Well, if the paste matches the pants,
you can make yourself paste pants...

223
...and she won't know the difference.

224
Joey, do you have a minute?

225
Dude, what am I...?

226
Rachel's here, so good luck, man.
Let me know how it works out.

227
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.

228
Oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.

229
I'm putting out fires all over the place.

230
Okay, okay.
Joey, I have got to tell you something.

231
What is it? What is it?

232
Oh, my God. It's so huge. But you have to
promise me, you cannot tell anyone.

233
- No, no, no. I don't want to know.
- What?

234
Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know.
This is unbelievable.

235
I don't care, Rach. Look, I'm tired of being
the guy who knows all the secrets...

236
...and can't tell anyone.

237
You know secrets? What are they?

238
And you're not supposed
to be gossiping.

239
No, I know, I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone...

240
I'm not listening to you.

241
Ross? Um...

242
You've been in there for a long time.

243
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.

244
All right, I'm coming out.

245
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

246
No. Let's just leave the lights on.

247
Oh, my God.

248
I had a problem.

249
Hey, Pheebs.

250
Oh, I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

251
Look...

252
Pheebs, I just...

253
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

254
And maybe, ask you
to be my teacher again?

255
And I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

256
- You really think I'm ready?
- Uh-huh.

257
Wow, cool.

258
Okay.

259
- Was the chord at least right before...?
- No.

260
Oh, my God.

261
We heard about your pants. I'm so sorry.

262
This year was supposed to be great.

263
Well, it's only the second day,
and I'm a loser...

264
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit.

265
You're not a loser.

266
Look at me.

267
Hey, look. Look, Ross.

268
Ben drew a picture of you.

269
Huh? You're a cowboy.

270
Oh.

271
Because of the leather pants?

272
Ben doesn't think you're a loser.
He thinks you're a cowboy.

273
I mean, that's something.

274
- It really is something.
- Howdy, partner. Hey.

275
Maybe I should get another pair.

276
Ooh, you know, they had some...

277
...with fringe all down the sides.

278
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.

279
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.

280
I would make a good cowboy.

281
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up
here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.

282
Yeah, me too.
You know, if this shirt is dirty. Yep.

283
Okay, I'm gonna go to.

284
I'm gonna go to the airport.
If I hang around there long enough...

285
...someone's bound to leave
one of those planes unattended.

286
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

287
Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing
I was going to tell you about?

288
I'm not gonna tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

289
...that would be okay,
and then we could talk about it, right?

290
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.

291
Yeah.

292
Hey, Joe, would you mind going over
into Chandler's bedroom...

293
...and getting that book back
that he borrowed from me?

294
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

295
Yeah.

296
- Do you know something?
- Do you know something?

297
- I might know something.
- I might too something too.

298
- What's the thing you know?
- You tell me what you know.

299
- I can't tell you.
- Then I can't.

300
Okay, fine.

301
You don't know.

302
How about I go there and walk into
Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...

303
...that I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know.

304
- You know.
- And you know.

305
Yeah, I know.

306
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable.

307
- How long have you known?
- Too long. Oh, my God.

308
Rach, I've been dying to talk
to someone about this for so long.

309
Listen, listen. You can't say anything
to anybody. They're so weird about that.

310
- Listen. Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey.

311
It's raining. I don't like to fly
in the rain so...

312
Oh, I am going to go for a walk
in the rain. Ha, ha.

313
Oh, yeah, me too.

314
That's weird.

315
I bet they're doing it.

316
Oh, good. Okay, look. I can't
take it anymore. I can't take it anymore.

317
So you win. Okay? Here.

318
Pheebs? Flying a jet?
Better make it a spaceship...

319
...so you can get back
to your home planet.

320
And Ross. Phone call for you today.
Tom Jones. He wants his pants back.

321
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
a character from Fraggle Rock?

﻿1
Come on, Joey!

2
Rach, I told you everything I knew
last night.

3
It's not that big a deal.
So Monica and Chandler are doing it.

4
I cannot believe you would say that!

5
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."

6
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!

7
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?

8
I don't know.

9
Is he romantic with her?

10
I don't know.

11
Are they in love?

12
- I don't know.
- Ugh.

13
You don't know anything.

14
- Oh! I know one thing.
- What?

15
They did it right there on the couch.

16
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

17
Gunther, could I have a scone, please?

18
Want to hear some good news?

19
Someone I know is getting married.

20
Yeah, weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, by the by, it's my ex-wife, Emily!

21
Sorry, man.

22
- Here's your scone.
- Thanks, Gunther.

23
Thanks.

24
Stupid British snack food!

25
Did they teach you that
in anger management?

26
You know what might help deal with it?
Think of it this way.

27
You and Emily are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.

28
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?

29
- I don't think anybody's mad about that.
- Exactly! Because it's in the past.

30
Anybody going to eat that?

31
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?

32
We had a lot of liquor
left over from the Christmas party.

33
I think this is cool.
None of our friends are here.

34
We can be a real couple.
We don't have to hide.

35
- I know. I can do this.
- Ooh.

36
And I can do this.

37
- We can't do that.
- We can't do that.

38
Hey, Bing! Ha-ha-ha.

39
Whoa! Who's the pretty lady,
and what is she doing with you?

40
Ha-ha-ha! I ask myself that very question.
This is Monica.

41
- My boss, Doug. This is Monica.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

42
- Hi! This is my wife, Kara.
- Nice to meet you.

43
- Bing!
- Okay!

44
Did you hear about the new law firm
working for us?

45
- No, sir.
- Yeah, Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

46
Come on, let's go drink our body weight.

47
- What was that?
- What?

48
That noise you made?

49
- Oh, that was my work laugh.
- Your work laugh?

50
If you're going to survive this party,
you have to come up with one too.

51
- All right. Check me out.
- Okay.

52
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town." Ha!

53
Hey, everybody at work
loved you last night.

54
- Really?
- And they like me more...

55
...just because I was with you.

56
You repaired a lot of the damage
from when they met Joey.

57
Doug wants us to play tennis.
He's never talked to me outside of work.

58
Except for that time
at that strip club.

59
Strip church.

60
- I'm gonna go try to find a racket.
- I thought you had one.

61
I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun
to go to Central Park and hit rocks...

62
...at bigger rocks.

63
- Hey, Rach, do you have a tennis racket?
- Hey.

64
Oh, um, I lent it to Joey
and I've never gotten it back.

65
Okay, good luck with that.

66
- Ahem. Hey.
- Hey.

67
What's up?

68
What are you doing here?
I thought you had inventory.

69
Well I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...

70
...and spend some time
with my friend, Monica.

71
You know, I feel like
we don't talk anymore.

72
How are you?

73
What is new with you?

74
Heh, um...

75
Not much. Um, work's good.

76
We don't have to talk about work.
We could talk about anything.

77
Okay. Um...

78
Hey! You know what?

79
Let's talk about relationships.

80
- Okay. What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

81
You go.

82
Well, I... There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.

83
Um, but I don't anymore.

84
Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...

85
You know what? I actually do
have a lot of work to do.

86
You're sure there's just
not anything else?

87
Yes, I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

88
No.

89
I...

90
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.

91
Okay, then what happened?

92
Uh, oh! Aw.

93
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

94
Ah-ah, you'll get your turn.

95
- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?
- Hey. Nothing.

96
This is not over.

97
- No, no, no!
- What?

98
Ugh, I was up all night writing
this really nasty letter to Emily.

99
It was perfect,
and now it's all covered in...

100
Actually, thanks!

101
All right!
Everybody ready to go to the movies?

102
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.

103
- Really?
- I'm gonna stay and read my book.

104
I just want to be alone right now.

105
Oh. Sure you don't want to come?

106
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.

107
- That's okay, Joe.
- All right.

108
Let's go, Pheebs.

109
Oh, God!

110
Bing!

111
- Unh!
- Aah!

112
Game!

113
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
that partner of yours is a real tiger.

114
Are you all right?

115
We'll just get
a little sip of water.

116
Am I on fire today or what?

117
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.

118
Okay, easy, Martina.

119
I think we should let them
win the next game.

120
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you just said.

121
Let them win one.

122
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!

123
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.

124
You're not giving them a chance.

125
They have rackets, don't they?

126
Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna
make this the last game.

127
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.

128
Are you sure you never played pro?
Ha-ha-ha.

129
Please let them win.

130
I'll take it down to 95 percent,
but that's the best I can do.

131
- Oopsie! Missed it!
- I got it!

132
Nice shot.

133
I got it!

134
Long!

135
I can't believe you let them win.

136
Yeah, well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.

137
- I was frustrated.
- It was my racket.

138
I was frustrated with you!

139
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.

140
What bothers me...

141
...is how different
you act around them.

142
The throwing the tennis games,
the fake laugh...

143
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"

144
I don't like "work Chandler."
The guy's a suck-up.

145
You know what?
Because you said that...

146
...I'm not putting out tonight!

147
Something's wrong.
My brother does not stay out all night.

148
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.

149
Ross couldn't fit
down the trash chute.

150
That's right. He almost could.

151
Which is exactly
how I got stuck there.

152
- Hey!
- Hey.

153
Oh, my God!

154
Where the hell have you been?

155
Just, you know, out.

156
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.

157
What were you doing?

158
I, uh, went to a bar and then...

159
...I just, uh, walked around for a while.

160
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?

161
He hooked up!

162
He hooked up with someone.

163
I don't have to answer your questions.
Okay? I'm a big boy.

164
I can do whatever I want.

165
He hooked up!

166
Tell us about her!

167
Ross, you left your scarf...

168
Hey, you guys.

169
Okay. Okay.

170
I know what you all are thinking,
but Chandler is in Yemen.

171
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.

172
Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.

173
So I'm asking you, please
just take a moment before you judge me.

174
Oh, nobody's judging you.

175
Oh.

176
Okay, you,
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

177
...call me.

178
Okay, look,
I know what you guys are going to say.

179
You two would have
very hairy children.

180
I didn't know you'd say that.

181
Ross! Janice?

182
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

183
This is Ross. Okay?

184
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.

185
He obviously lost his mind.

186
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.

187
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

188
Are you going to see her again?

189
- Don't put ideas in his head!
- I am gonna see her again.

190
Damn it, Phoebe!

191
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.

192
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew that you liked him.

193
Wow! That feels so good
to get off my chest. Okay, you go.

194
- My turn? What are you talking about?
- Ugh.

195
Monica...

196
I know about you and Chandler.

197
What?

198
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.

199
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."

200
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"

201
And you said, "No.

202
You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."

203
Well, heh...

204
Sounds like you're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.

205
Wow, I... Let me know how
that one turns out.

206
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.

207
Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...

208
...you would have heard me
call him Mister Big...

209
...ot.
- What?

210
Mr. Bigot.

211
Ha, ha. He tells the most racist jokes.

212
All right. So that's it.

213
You're telling me there's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?

214
Me and Chandler?

215
- Put your $20 down.
- Okay.

216
First one to find the tasty treat wins.

217
- Okay? All right.
- Mm-hm.

218
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

219
And they're off!

220
Whoa.

221
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?

222
Judge rules no violation.

223
Agh.

224
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah.

225
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.

226
- What?
- Are you serious?

227
Yeah. I opened up to her about all the
terrible stuff that's been happening to me.

228
I mean, I talked for hours.

229
It is amazing...

230
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.

231
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.

232
- And the duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! Agh!

233
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!

234
Judge rules...

235
...Nutter Butter.
- Ugh.

236
- Tough call.
- Yeah.

237
Seriously, I strongly believe that
we should all support President Clinton...

238
...and her husband, Bill.

239
So how do you like your coffee?

240
- None for me.
- Just a little bit of sugar.

241
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.

242
That ought to sweeten it up.

243
- How does that not give you a headache?
- You get used to it.

244
I don't think that I can.

245
Maybe this will be it for me
on the work things.

246
So I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?

247
I'd rather not hang out with
this work-weasel guy...

248
...when I could be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.

249
Oh.

250
Ah, heh.

251
I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.

252
I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.

253
It's not strong enough
to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!

254
Hear what I said?

255
What?

256
It's a joke, Bing.
What's the matter with you?

257
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.

258
Excuse me?

259
- Well, I just...
- Honey?

260
I just don't think
you understood the joke.

261
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.

263
Heh, you see,
Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.

264
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.

265
- You get it now, honey?
- I think I do!

266
- Thank you, Monica.
- I thought you could use the help.

267
Ha-ha-ha.

268
Coffee in a fight!

269
Hey, Rach.

270
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?

271
Sure. Why?

272
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.

273
What? She just called and said
she was going to be working late.

274
She keeps lying to me.

275
That's it! I'm gonna go over there
and I'm confronting them right now.

276
So you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?

277
I'm just not very good at this.

278
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.

279
- But we're not ready to tell yet.
- I know.

280
Ever since high school, Rachel was
the one person that I told everything to.

281
I miss that so much now.

282
She's my best friend.

283
Joey?

284
- Oh, my God, Rachel!
- Hey!

285
Hi!

286
What are you doing here?

287
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...

288
...to, um, look at my books.

289
You know, see them a little better. Heh.

290
- Okay, great. Great. Um...
- Yeah.

291
Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that, um...

292
...I was cleaning it.

293
- In fact, he pays me to clean it.
- Oh!

294
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.

295
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work, um...

296
...I'm at my new work.

297
Good enough. Right?

298
Okay, well, um...

299
I'm gonna go look at my books.

300
- Okay. Go get back to my new job.
- Okay.

301
Okay.

302
Congratulations on your new job!

303
Man, she is really gullible.

304
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

305
- Actually, I should get going.
- You're sure?

306
I can stay out as late as you want.

307
I told you I'm on
sabbatical from work...

308
Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.

309
- Oh, man!
- What is wrong now?

310
This isn't what I ordered.

311
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?

312
First, my marriage falls apart,
and then...

313
I know, I know!

314
You lose your apartment,
then you lose your job...

315
...then your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!

316
Aah!

317
Ross...

318
...we need to talk.
- Okay.

319
- Sometimes I feel...
- No, no, don't.

320
I'm going to talk.

321
I believe...

322
...that the sun has set...

323
...on our day in the sun.

324
- What?
- You're a very sweet person, Ross.

325
Um...

326
Unfortunately...

327
...I just don't think I can take
another second of you whining!

328
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

329
You're ending this with me because...

330
...I'm too whiny?

331
Mm.

332
So you're saying...

333
...I've become so whiny...

334
...that I...

335
...annoy you...

336
...Janice.

337
Well, yeah!

338
Oh, my God!

339
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I am now.

340
Okay.

341
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

342
Well...

343
I guess, that's two out of three...

344
...Joey!

345
- Dude, we gotta talk.
- Okay.

346
I want to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.

347
I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...

348
...I had a thing with Janice.

349
You're not mad?

350
Why would I be mad?

351
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.

352
You don't, uh... You don't fool around
with your friends' ex-girlfriends...

353
...or, uh...

354
...possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

355
I am mad.

356
But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna forgive you.

357
Because that's what friends do.

358
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.

359
- All the things on the list there.
- Thank you.

360
But I want you to remember...

361
...that I forgave you.

362
- Okay.
- I also want you to remember...

363
...that I let you live here rent-free.

364
- All right.
- And I want you to remember...

365
...that I gave you 27 dollars.

366
No strings attached!

367
If you can't remember that...

368
...I think we should write it down.
Let's write it down!

﻿1
Ah, I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

2
It's so good for Monica.

3
Time's up! My turn.

4
- That was half an hour?
- It's your timer.

5
- Okay.
- All right.

6
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

7
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

8
Aah! Aah! Aah.

9
It's so good, isn't it?

10
I don't know what I did to deserve it.

11
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

12
Goodbye, muscles!

13
She gives the worst massages ever.

14
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

15
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

16
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.

17
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

18
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.

19
Dude, look out!

20
You almost crushed my hat.

21
Sorry.

22
And the bunny got away.

23
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

24
Oh. Yeah.

25
There's this play, right?

26
I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

27
A clothes horse, so I figure...

28
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

29
And you'll make them disappear?

30
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

31
Done!

32
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

33
- Thanks!
- Sure.

34
Please, take those off!

35
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

36
Um, only okay. Because I just
got back from the hospital.

37
Are you all right?

38
I'm fine.
But, uh, my grandma sort of died.

39
- Pheebs, sorry.
- It's okay.

40
She had a really incredible life.

41
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

42
Maybe she's with us right now.

43
Right. She's on a new spiritual plane
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

44
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

45
Uh, Pheebs' grandmother just died.

46
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

47
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

48
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

49
Not the way they're doing it.

50
What happened? How did she die?

51
We were in the market...

52
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

53
I'm so sorry.

54
The last thing she said was:

55
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

56
You know what?

57
We will meet at the checkout counter.

58
Since you're returning all this stuff...

59
...you'll have to wear underwear.

60
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

61
It's missing something.

62
Oh, I know. Um, okay.

63
Really? A purse?

64
It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.

65
- It looks like a woman's purse.
- No.

66
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

67
See, look. Men carrying the bag.

68
See, look. Women carrying the bag.

69
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

70
Exactly. Unisex!

71
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

72
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

73
I ain't going to say no to that!

74
- Who is it?
- It's Phoebe.

75
Oh, great!

76
Oh, you.

77
Um, what's up?

78
Um, well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

79
Um, no, thanks.

80
Um...

81
- Well, um, Grandma died today.
- Wow!

82
Didn't she die like five years ago?

83
No, she just died today.

84
Um, we're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

85
Okay, I know I went to that already.

86
No, you didn't!

87
Then who's been dead?

88
Lots of people!

89
Look, are you coming or not?

90
Um, no.

91
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

92
Plus I'm going to a concert.

93
I'd invite you,
but, um, I only have two tickets left.

94
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

95
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

97
What?
Are you referring to my man's bag?

98
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

99
It's got compartments for all your stuff.

100
- Your wallet, keys, address book...
- Your makeup.

101
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

102
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

103
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

104
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

105
- All right, then you owe me $350.
- Fine.

106
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

107
Joey...

108
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

109
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

110
Don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.

111
You-and-I sexy?

112
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

113
Here's your, um, 3-D glasses.

114
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

115
Hi, sweetie.

116
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

117
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

118
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

119
I brought you flowers.

120
Oh, thanks!

121
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

122
Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?

123
Welcome.

124
Here's your 3-D glasses.

125
All right.

126
So how did you know Frances?

127
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

128
But, um, I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

129
What's your name?

130
Frank Buffay.

131
You know what? Strike that.
My name, uh, actually, is Joe.

132
Um, uh, Joe, uh, Hill.

133
- You're Frank Buf...
- Shh. No! Joe Hill.

134
You just said...

135
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

136
But...

137
Oh, my God!

138
What happened?

139
That was my dad.

140
- Oh, my God! What?
- Check it out!

141
It's like it's coming right at me.

142
- Did you catch him?
- What did he say?

143
He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

144
I couldn't give him my real name.

145
Why not?

146
You saw the way he ran.

147
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

148
What did you say to him?

149
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

150
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

151
Could everyone take their seats?

152
I just can't think about that now.

153
- I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
- Okay.

154
Let's go say goodbye.

155
I'm off to my audition. How do I look?

156
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

157
And a date with a man.

158
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

159
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

160
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

161
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

162
...comes with a bag!

163
I've got to meet my dad.

164
Will you tell him who you are?

165
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

166
But aren't you pissed at him?

167
This guy abandoned you.

168
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

169
I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

170
You and me, outside. Right now!"

171
I kind of scared myself.

172
Well, at least you scared someone.

173
You'd think I'd be angry.

174
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny little head off!

175
Fortunately, I'm past it.

176
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

177
Oh, get off! Ow!

178
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

179
What are you talking about?

180
As a masseuse and a human...

181
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone.

182
I give good massages.

183
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

184
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

185
He does not like it. He's in pain!

186
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

187
- What?
- I'm sorry but, ow!

188
You've been lying to me?

189
I can't believe that.

190
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

191
But the minute we start
to lie to each other...

192
And by "we"...

193
...I mean society.

194
Anytime you're ready.

195
Ahem, well, you must be new here.

196
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

197
Could you try it without the purse?

198
Yeah, sure.

199
Ahem, well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit...

200
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

201
Well, first, it's not a purse.

202
Okay...

203
Anytime.

204
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

205
It's a man's bag.

206
Okay. And go.

207
Let me show you the catalog.

208
Look. See?

209
Huh? It's the latest thing.

210
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

211
Do you sell these?

212
No, these babies sell themselves.

213
Thank you. That was great.

214
But I didn't read anything.

215
I think we've seen enough.

216
All right, I'll see you.

217
We got it. We got it.

218
- Is Rachel here?
- No.

219
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

220
I really like them.

221
Please stop.

222
We're supposed to be honest.

223
I wish you could tell me,
"I don't like your massages."

224
I don't like your massages.

225
See? It's no big deal.

226
But now you're crying.

227
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

228
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

229
You don't have
to be best at everything.

230
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

231
Okay...

232
You give the worst massages
in the world.

233
I'm crying here!

234
Look, hear me out.

235
You give the best bad massages.

236
If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage...

237
...and they thought, "Who's the best?"

238
They'd have to go to you.

239
Huh.

240
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

241
...for the best bad massage...
Who would get that?

242
It would be you!

243
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

244
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

245
Absolutely.

246
Okay...

247
I suck!

248
Thank you for meeting me.

249
Thank you.

250
Come sit.

251
Sit.

252
Sit!

253
Um, alrighty.
Um, before we get started, I need you...

254
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

255
Yes, I am. Mm-hm.

256
- Okay.
- So, what did Frances leave me?

257
- Huh?
- That's why you wanted me to come.

258
Oh, yes.

259
Yes, she did. She left you, um...

260
...this lipstick.

261
Oh. Huh.

262
Oh, it's, ew, used.

263
Uh, cool.

264
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

265
So question one:

266
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

267
Yes, I was.

268
Okay, um, question two:
Um, did that marriage end...

269
...A, happily...

270
...B, medium...

271
...or, C, in the total abandonment...

272
...of her and her two children?

273
It really says that?

274
Yeah, see?

275
I guess then I would have to say C.

276
Total abandonment.

277
Reasons for abandonment:

278
Um, A, top secret government work...

279
...B, amnesia...

280
...or, C, you're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

281
...bad, bad man.

282
I don't want the lipstick that much.

283
Would you do me a favor?

284
Would you give Lilly...

285
...that, please?
- What?

286
When you see Lilly, give her that note.

287
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

288
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

289
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

290
But you came to see Lilly?

291
Yeah. Why?

292
Lilly's dead.

293
She what?

294
She's dead.

295
Are you sure?

296
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

297
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe...

298
How? Oh, my God.

299
How long ago?

300
Seventeen years ago.

301
Oh.

302
What about the girls?

303
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

304
And Phoebe...

305
...is on this couch.

306
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you.

307
Phoebe, I, um...

308
Whoops.

309
It's just, I don't know what to say.

310
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

311
Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.

312
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

313
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

314
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

315
So you can just go.

316
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

317
- That's your defense?
- Yes, it is.

318
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

319
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

320
You make up songs?

321
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

322
Let's see, how did it go? Um...

323
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

324
Why won't you go to sleep?

325
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

326
You're keeping me up

327
I'm not very good at this.

328
Well, I am.

329
Not yet. No.

330
Hey.

331
Hey! How'd the audition go?

332
Estelle said I didn't get it.

333
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

334
I thought so too...

335
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

336
What kind of problem?

337
To tell you the truth...

338
...they had a problem with the bag!
- Oh, my God!

339
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

340
It's time to give up the bag.

341
I don't want to give up the bag.

342
I don't have to give it up, do I, Rach?

343
You think I should give up the bag!

344
Joey, I'm sorry.
As terrific as I think you are with it...

345
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

346
I can't believe this!

347
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

348
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

349
...controversial.

350
Yeah, um, they're called wallets.

﻿1
Oh, hey, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.

2
Oh.

3
Huh. I'd say from the looks of it,
our naked buddy is moving.

4
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes."

5
Aw, I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

6
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

7
Hey. Hey, if he's moving,
maybe I should try to get his place.

8
- Oh, yeah.
- Good idea.

9
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

10
Yeah, hey, then we could do
that telephone thing...

11
...you know, where you have a can,
we have a can...

12
...and it's connected by a string.

13
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

14
Oh, my God. I love this apartment.

15
Isn't it perfect?

16
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is.

17
That is because your eye
immediately goes to the big naked man.

18
It's amazing.

19
You better hurry up and fill out
an application, or I'll beat you to it.

20
Oh, heh.

21
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm
gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

22
Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler.
Hey!

23
Hey, you guys! Hey!

24
Oh!

25
Aah! Aah!

26
Aah! Chandler and Monica.
Chandler and Monica.

27
Oh, my God.

28
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

29
Oh, my eyes! My eyes!

30
- Phoebe. Phoebe.
- Ow!

31
It's okay. It's okay.

32
- No, they're doing it!
- I know.

33
- I know. I know.
- You know?

34
Yes, I know, and Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't...

35
...so you have to stop screaming!

36
Hey, what's going on?

37
- What?
- Nothing.

38
Oh, God, we're just so excited
that you might get this apartment.

39
- Actually, it looks really good.
- Aah! It looks pretty good!

40
Get in here! Come on!

41
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler were, like...

42
...doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

43
All that time Monica spent on the phone
with sad Linda from camp?

44
Uh-huh.
Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.

45
I can't believe it.

46
I mean, I think it's great. For him.

47
She might be able to do better.

48
- Hey, you guys.
- Joey, come here. Come here.

49
Phoebe just found out
about Monica and Chandler.

50
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

51
No. No, Joey, she knows.

52
We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment
and saw them doing it through the window.

53
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

54
Okay, so now they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

55
Yes, but you know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.

56
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

57
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

58
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

59
Well, what do you mean?

60
You know, every time they say
they're doing laundry...

61
...we'll give them laundry to do.

62
- Oh, I would enjoy that.
- No, no, no.

63
Wait, Rach, you know what would be
even more fun? Telling them.

64
- Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
- I can't take any...

65
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them that we know.

66
No. I can't take any more secrets.

67
I got your secrets, I got their secrets.
I got secrets of my own, you know.

68
- You don't have any secrets.
- Oh, yeah?

69
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

70
So, ahem, um...

71
How are we going to mess with them?

72
Well, you could use your position
as the roommate.

73
And then I would use, you know,
the strongest tool at my disposal.

74
My sexuality.

75
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

76
Okay. Watch, learn,
and don't eat my cookie.

77
- Hey.
- Hey.

78
Ooh. Wow, that jacket
looks great on you.

79
- Really?
- Yeah. The material looks so soft.

80
Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.

81
You've been working out?

82
Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.

83
Are you okay?

84
Well, if you really wanna know...

85
Oh, I can't tell you this.

86
Phoebe, it's me,
you can tell me anything.

87
Well, actually, you're the one person
I can't tell this to.

88
And the one person I want to the most.

89
What's going on?

90
I think it's just, you know,
that I haven't been with a guy in so long...

91
...and you know how sometimes
you're looking for something...

92
...and you don't see that it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee...

93
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

94
Well, just something to think about.
I know I will.

95
Ooh. Ha, ha.

96
- You are so cute.
- Heh.

97
How did you get to be so cute?

98
Well, my grandfather was Swedish.

99
And my grandmother was actually
a tiny little bunny.

100
Okay, now you're even cuter.

101
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

102
What?

103
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

104
I think Phoebe was hitting on me.

105
What are you talking about?

106
I'm telling you,
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

107
- It's not possible.
- Ow.

108
I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

109
...in a sexless kind of way.

110
Oh, well, you know,
I can't hear that enough.

111
I'm sorry, I just think
you misunderstood her.

112
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay?
She was all over me.

113
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

114
This bicep?

115
Well, it's not flexed right now.

116
Hey, Mon, what are you doing?
Want to come see a movie with us?

117
Uh, actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

118
- Chandler, you want to do it with me?
- Sure, I'll do it with you.

119
Okay, great. Hold on a second.

120
Unh. Here you go.

121
You don't mind, do you?
That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.

122
Ha, ha. You know what?
I don't think I have enough quarters.

123
Oh, I have quarters.

124
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?

125
Well, I called over there, and it turns out
Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.

126
And he's already had like 100 applicants.

127
- Oh.
- No, no, I've got the edge.

128
I know it's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

129
...to tip the scales in my direction.

130
Yeah. Check it out,
you can see it from the window.

131
Oh, is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

132
No.

133
That new mountain bike?

134
No.

135
Well, what did you send?

136
A basket of mini muffins.

137
There's a whole table
of mini muffin baskets.

138
Which one did you send?

139
The small one.

140
What? You actually thought that basket
was gonna get you the apartment?

141
Well, yeah.

142
Someone sent us a basket at work once
and people went crazy over those muffins.

143
It was the best day.

144
Your work makes me sad.

145
Oh, man, I want that place so much.

146
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

147
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

148
All right, we'd better go
if we're gonna catch that movie.

149
- Bye.
- Bye.

150
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

151
Okay, did you see that?
With the inappropriate, and the pinching?

152
Actually, I did.

153
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

154
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She knows about us.

155
Are you serious?

156
Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

157
That's the only explanation for it.

158
Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

159
She knows.

160
Joey.

161
Yeah?

162
Phoebe knows about us.

163
Well, I didn't tell them.

164
Them? Who's "them"?

165
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

166
Joey.

167
And Rachel.

168
Look, I would have told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

169
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

170
But, hey, it's over now, right?

171
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

172
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

173
- Unless...
- No, not "unless." This must end now.

174
Oh, man, they think they are so slick
messing with us.

175
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

176
- So...
- Ah, yes.

177
The messers become the messees.

178
Oh, Ross, honey,
you gotta stop torturing yourself.

179
Why don't you just find
another apartment?

180
I've already looked at
like a thousand apartments this month.

181
None of them even compares
to that one.

182
You know what you should do?

183
You should find out what his hobbies are
and then use that to bond with him.

184
Yeah. Like if I wanted something
from Joey...

185
...I would strike up a conversation
about, say, um, sandwiches...

186
...or, uh, my underwear.

187
I'm listening.

188
See?

189
That is a great idea.

190
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

191
So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.

192
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.

193
- But he broke that.
- Well, he had gravity boots.

194
Yeah, he broke those too.

195
So he likes to break stuff.

196
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben,
but I will figure something out.

197
Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

198
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

199
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.

200
Hello?

201
Oh, yeah, hey.
Hold on a second, she's right here.

202
It's Chandler.

203
Oh.

204
Hello, you.

205
Hello, Phoebe,
I've been thinking about you all day.

206
Huh?

207
Well, you know that thing you said before?
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

208
Really?

209
Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.

210
Why don't you come over
and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.

211
Or maybe more.

212
I'll have to get back to you on that.
Okay, bye.

213
Oh, my God. He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more.

214
- Are you kidding?
- No.

215
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon...

216
Joey? Do they know that we know?

217
- No.
- Joey?

218
- They know you know.
- Ooh, I knew it.

219
Oh, I cannot believe those two.

220
They thought they could mess with us?
They're trying to mess with us?

221
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

222
And, Joey, you can't say anything.

223
Couldn't if I wanted to.

224
Good evening, sir.
My name is Ross Geller.

225
I'm one of the people
who applied for the apartment...

226
...and I realize that the competition
is fierce, but...

227
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked and...

228
I applaud you.

229
Man, I wish I was naked.

230
I mean, this looks so great.

231
That is how God intended it.

232
- Look at them. They're panicked.
- Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.

233
Oh, yeah.

234
All right, if he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

235
- I'm going to go in.
- Okay, okay.

236
Be sexy.

237
Please.

238
So, Chandler,
I'd love to come by tonight.

239
Really?

240
Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?

241
Yes.

242
Good. I'm really looking forward
to you and me having sexual intercourse.

243
Hey, hey, check it out, check it out.
Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

244
Oh, yeah.

245
Oh, my God. That's our friend.

246
- It's Naked Ross.
- It is Ross!

247
Showtime.

248
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.

249
And, Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

250
All right, it'll be great.

251
You just make her think you want to
have sex with her and it'll freak her out.

252
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna
have to go with her?

253
Relax, she's gonna give in
way before you do.

254
- How do you know?
- Because you're on my team.

255
And my team always wins.

256
At this?

257
Just go get some. Go.

258
Okay, honey, now,
I'm gonna try to listen from right here.

259
- Okay.
- Okay. Oh, wait.

260
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

261
- Don't give away the farm.
- Okay.

262
Phoebe.

263
- Chandler.
- Come on in.

264
I was going to.

265
Um, I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

266
Sure.

267
So here we are. Nervous?

268
Me? No. You?

269
No. I want this to happen.

270
So do I.

271
I'm going to put on some music.

272
Maybe... Maybe I'll dance for you.

273
You look good.

274
Thanks. Heh.

275
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me wanna...

276
...rip that sweater vest right off.

277
Well, why don't we move this
into the bedroom?

278
- Really?
- Oh, do you not want to?

279
No. No.

280
I just, you know, first,
I wanna take off all my clothes...

281
...and have you rub lotion on me.

282
Well, that would be nice.

283
I'll go get the lotion.

284
This is totally getting out of hand, okay?
She wants me to put lotion on her.

285
- She's bluffing.
- Look, she's not backing down.

286
She went like this...

287
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

288
Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?

289
I want to sit in my chair.

290
Joey, look at it this way,
the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...

291
...the sooner this is all over
and out in the open.

292
Ooh, I like that.

293
Oh, okay. Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

294
Joey!

295
Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.

296
It's not my first time.

297
You go back out there
and you seduce her till she cracks.

298
Okay. Give me a second.

299
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

300
Oh, you're, uh... You're going?

301
Um, not without you, lover.

302
So this is my bra.

303
It's very, very nice.

304
Well, come here.

305
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

306
You should be. I'm very bendy.

307
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

308
Well, I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

309
Here it comes.

310
Our first kiss.

311
Okay, okay, okay. You win.

312
- Ha!
- I can't have sex with you.

313
- And why not?
- Because I'm in love with Monica.

314
You're... You're what?

315
Love her. That's right. I love her.

316
I love her.

317
I love you, Monica.

318
I love you too, Chandler.

319
I just thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

320
Dude.

321
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

322
And may I say your breasts
are still showing?

323
God.

324
All right. So that's it?

325
It's over. Everybody knows.

326
Well, actually, Ross doesn't.

327
Yes, and we'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

328
A new place for a new Ross.

329
I'm gonna have you
and all the guys from work over...

330
...once it's, you know, furnished.

331
I must say, it's nice to see you
back on your feet.

332
Well, I am that, uh, and the whole
rage thing is definitely behind me.

333
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our team at the museum.

334
Oh, Donald, that would be great.

335
I am totally ready to come back to work.
I...

336
What? No.

337
What are you doing?

338
Get off my sister!

﻿1
Chandler! Chandler!

2
I saw what you were doing
through the window.

3
I saw what you were doing to my sister,
now, get out here!

4
Well, listen, we had a good run.

5
You know? What was it?
Four, five months?

6
I mean, that's more than most people
have in a lifetime.

7
So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.

8
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm going on the lam.

9
Come on, Chandler. Come on.
I can handle Ross.

10
Hold on.

11
Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?

12
What the hell are you doing?

13
Hey, what's going on?

14
Well, I think... I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

15
Dude, he's right there.

16
I thought you were my best friend.
This is my sister.

17
My best friend and my sister.
I cannot believe this.

18
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

19
Okay? I'm in love with her.

20
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

21
I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.

22
My best friend and my sister.

23
I cannot believe this.

24
You guys want to probably get
some hugs in too, huh? Big news.

25
Oh, no, that's okay.
We've actually known for a while.

26
What? What? You guys knew?

27
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

28
Well, Ross, we were worried
about you, okay?

29
We didn't know how you were
going to react.

30
Mm-mm.

31
You were worried about me?

32
You didn't know how I was gonna react?

33
Okay. All right. Whew.

34
What do you say we all, uh,
clear out of here...

35
...and let these two love birds
get back down to business.

36
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

37
Hey, you know what I just realized?

38
- If you guys ever have kids...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're having kids?

39
I call godfather.

40
You can't just call godfather.

41
Don't you think her brother
should be godfather?

42
Sure. If you cared enough to call it first.

43
- Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
- Yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.

44
Oh, oh, I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift to get you.

45
Oh, I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't think of anything.

46
Hey, Katie.

47
- Hey, everyone, this is Katie.
- Hi.

48
- Hi.
- You ready to go?

49
- Yeah, just gotta run to the bathroom.
- Sure.

50
- Hey, where are we going to lunch?
- I was thinking maybe Chinese food.

51
I love Chinese.

52
How did you know I love Chinese?

53
She is so cute.

54
You could fit her
right in your little pocket.

55
I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but...

56
But what?

57
She keeps punching me.

58
In the cute little, sweet way she just did?

59
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay?

60
She's hurting me.

61
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

62
Hey, Ross, what is Ben doing
after preschool?

63
Okay, come on, Joey is having a problem.
There's a little girl who's beating him up.

64
Aw, Joey, come here. Look.

65
Honey, I know. This must be
really, really difficult for you, and...

66
Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

67
- Hey.
- Hey.

68
- I brought you some housewarming gifts.
- Oh.

69
- Salt, so your life always has flavor.
- Ah.

70
- Bread, so you never go hungry.
- Oh.

71
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

72
Because, well, you know.

73
Well, thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

74
Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Steve Cera,
President of the tenants' committee.

75
Oh, hi. Ross Geller.
And, uh, this is my friend Phoebe.

76
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Mr. President.

77
I, uh, came to talk to you about Howard.

78
Howard?

79
Yeah, he's the handyman.
He's gonna be retiring next week...

80
...and everyone who lives here is kicking in
a hundred bucks...

81
...as a "thank you for all the hard work"
type of thing.

82
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

83
So you want to give me a check, or?

84
Oh, uh...

85
You don't have to give it to me now.
You can slip it under my door.

86
No, no, it's not that. It's just...
I just moved in.

87
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

88
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.

89
Oh.

90
Okay, I get it.

91
Wait. Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

92
I mean, I don't know Howard.

93
Howard's the handyman.

94
Yes, but to me he's just "man."

95
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

96
Welcome to the building.

97
Can you believe that guy?

98
Yeah. I really like his glasses.

99
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate...

100
...and now the whole building hates me.

101
A little kid spit on my knee.

102
You know what? I'm gonna throw a party.
That's right, for everyone in the building.

103
And I'm gonna sit them all down and
explain to them that I am not a bad guy.

104
I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy...

105
...who stands up for what he believes in.

106
A man with principles.

107
- Sounds like a fun party.
- Mm.

108
Look, Ross, if you want
your neighbors to like you...

109
...why don't you just pay
the hundred bucks?

110
- A party's gonna cost you way more.
- That doesn't matter.

111
It's my principles.
We're talking about my principles.

112
Okay, I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

113
Oh, they'll like me once they come
to my awesome par-tay.

114
Okay, I gotta run.
I gotta go get some nametags.

115
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

116
Very, very funny. But don't say things
like that in from of Monica.

117
I don't want you putting any ideas
in her head.

118
Um, Chandler, you do realize
that those ideas...

119
...are probably already in Monica's head?

120
Why?

121
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

122
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

123
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out. I'm
telling you something you already know.

124
Come on. She broke up with Richard
because he didn't want to have babies.

125
And she's a woman, and she's almost 30,
and, you know, it's Monica.

126
I don't see it that way. Okay?
I see two Monicas:

127
The one that was my friend who lives
across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.

128
And the new Monica who I started to date.
Now, who is to say what she wants?

129
I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?

130
Yeah, you're right.

131
You are absolutely right.
I mean, that makes everything different.

132
Okay.

133
It's not different, is it?

134
Not unless "different" means the same.

135
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut.

136
You know, breadstick fangs
are always funny.

137
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one.

138
Uh, look, Katie, uh, listen,
we need to talk, okay?

139
Um, look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot, okay?

140
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

141
...it feels like someone's hitting me
with a very tiny, but a very real bat.

142
Oh. Like I could hurt you.

143
- Are you making fun of my size?
- No.

144
Don't make fun of me because of my size.

145
- Isn't this great?
- Mm.

146
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?

147
Chandler?

148
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

149
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever. Ha, ha.

150
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm cool.

151
Casual.

152
What are you doing?

153
Just hanging out. Having fun, you know,
uh, with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

154
Man, I knew it.
I knew you were going to do this.

155
What?

156
Get all freaked out because everybody
was joking around about marriage.

157
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?

158
And you know what I want?

159
Yes. You want babies.
You have baby fever.

160
I do not have baby fever.

161
Oh, please. You are obsessed
with babies and marriage...

162
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

163
You know what? Why don't we turn
the heat down on this pressure cooker?

164
Have you lost your mind?

165
Chandler, this isn't about me.

166
This is about you and all your weird
relationship commitment crap.

167
Uh-uh. I know you, okay? I know the
thoughts that you have in your head.

168
Well, you don't know everything.

169
Did you know I'm going out with Rachel
tonight instead of you? Hmm?

170
And that the only baby around here
is you?

171
And did you know I can't even
look at you right now?

172
Yeah, well, I did not know that.

173
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean,
she's not gonna leave me. This is fixable.

174
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely.

175
- By me?
- Oh, no, no, no.

176
Well, unless you make
some kind of big gesture.

177
Yeah, big, though.

178
Shh. The missus.

179
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

180
To go.

181
Monica...

182
I'm still not done
not wanting to talk to you.

183
Just tell me what I need to do
to make things right.

184
- What?
- That's what we do.

185
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

186
And then, you know,
you think I'm all cute again.

187
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

188
You're gonna have to
figure this out for yourself.

189
You know what? If you're too afraid
to be in a real relationship...

190
...then don't be in one.

191
Right about now
Funk soul brother

192
Check it out now
Funk soul brother

193
Right about now
Funk soul brother

194
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!

195
Phoebe. Phoebe.

196
Oh, hi, Ross.

197
What are you doing here?

198
Oh, I thought this was your party,
and it turns out it's a party for Howard.

199
He's the sweetest little man.

200
See you, Phoebe.
Oh, and, hey, thanks for chipping in.

201
Oh, sure.

202
You chipped in?

203
Yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.

204
Phoebe, I can't believe
you gave him money.

205
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

206
Yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?

207
This way I'm just, you know,
the exotic, generous stranger.

208
That's always fun to be.

209
Yeah, but you're making me look bad.

210
No, I'm not. No, if anything,
I'm making you look better.

211
They'll see you talking to me,
and I'm a hit.

212
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

213
Oh, hey, Ross.

214
Um, say, I was thinking
maybe you two could switch apartments.

215
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

216
Something to think about it.

217
Yeah, okay, my bad.

218
- Hey.
- Hi.

219
Wow. You look big.

220
Thanks, I've been working out.

221
Hey, listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

222
Uh, yeah.

223
But it's not obvious why.

224
Well, look, I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I had to put on some extra padding.

225
You know, I mean,
if she hits me when she's happy...

226
...can you imagine how hard
she's gonna hit me...

227
...when I tell her I'm taking away
the Joey love?

228
Hey.

229
Hey. Hey, cute jacket.

230
Oh, thanks.

231
- That's so sweet.
- Whoa. Ow.

232
Oh, "Ow."

233
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much.

234
Whoa. Ha, ha.

235
You know what? I gotta tell you...

236
...I think you're the one that is too much.

237
Joey has the nicest friends.

238
And the nicest girlfriend.

239
You're so sweet.

240
- You're so sweet.
- Ow!

241
Joey?

242
She just kicked me.

243
Huh.

244
Well, aren't you gonna do something?

245
Uh...

246
You better do something or I'm gonna
walk out that door right now.

247
Well, are you gonna?

248
Nah.

249
- Phoebe?
- Ha, ha. That's what I was saying.

250
Phoebe? Phoebe?

251
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

252
I'm talking you up to people.

253
Just give it a little time, all right? Relax.
Get something to eat.

254
So, uh, what did you tell them about me?

255
Um, I told them about you and Emily.
You know, trying to get some sympathy.

256
But somehow you came off
as the bad guy.

257
- What?
- Yeah, I think I told it wrong.

258
We should talk about that...

259
...because I don't totally understand
what happened there.

260
Oh. This cake is really good.

261
Okay, see?
Things are looking up already.

262
Oh, my God.
Someone cut Howard's cake.

263
Who would do a thing like that?

264
3-B.

265
Okay, you got your free food,
you ruined everyone's fun.

266
- Don't you think it's time you went home?
- Yeah.

267
Yeah, go back to 3-B, 3-B.

268
All right, everyone, calm down.
Everyone, calm down.

269
I have something that I would like to say.

270
Who here likes Ross?

271
Of course you don't like him.

272
He didn't give you any money.

273
He raised his own hand when I asked,
"Who here likes Ross?"

274
And he's wearing two nametags.

275
I'll be honest with you guys. When I first
met Ross, I didn't like him at all.

276
But then once I got to know him,
I saw that he's really sweet...

277
...and caring and very generous.

278
I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross
before you get to know him, all right?

279
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know...

280
Kurt? I thought, you know, abrasive drunk.

281
Um, Lola, mind-numbingly stupid.

282
And, okay, you guys:
Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.

283
So I think you all know what I mean.

284
Obviously, I didn't think
they were gonna start throwing things.

285
I just thought if I kept insulting them
you would jump in and defend everyone.

286
Then you could look like the hero.

287
Oh, wow, yeah.

288
See, I did not get that.

289
Where's Monica? Where is she? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent. Is she here?

290
- I'm Monica.
- I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

291
- Okay.
- Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking...

292
...about us. You know,
a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.

293
And, uh, well, I guess there's
only one way to do this.

294
- Wait, wait. What are you doing?
- Monica...

295
No, no, no. Don't do it.

296
Will you marry me?

297
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What a bad idea.

298
Oh, I can't not look at it.

299
Chandler, why are you doing this?

300
I don't know.

301
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

302
Chandler.

303
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

304
Do you, um, really think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

305
Oh, no, the best reason to get married
is pregnancy.

306
Sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being
ready and actually wanting to get married.

307
Will you be my wife?

308
Chandler, um,
I want you to take just a minute...

309
...and I want you to think about
how ridiculous this sounds.

310
Yeah, I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here right now.

311
You know that none of that stuff
came from me.

312
I mean, I never said that I wanted
to have babies and get married right now.

313
Yeah, I know, I was really confused,
and then I talked to these guys.

314
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

315
- Hey.
- She's right, you know.

316
Yeah, but still, cheap shot.

317
You know when I said that I want you...

318
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

319
- Well, you're not ready for that.
- I didn't think I was.

320
Oh, my God.

321
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

322
Well, I would've been happy because...

323
...I would have been able spend
the rest of my life with the woman I love.

324
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

325
- Hey, Ross, will you pass me that knife?
- No, I will not.

326
It's okay.
You don't have to be so mean about it.

327
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

328
Oh, and I was going to ask you
to marry me...

329
...because I forgot to say hello to you
last week.

330
Oh, no, wait, Pheebs.
I think with something like that...

331
...you just ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

332
Ha, ha, okay,
how long is this gonna go on?

333
Well, I think the length of teasing...

334
...is directly related
to how insane you were.

335
So a long time.

336
This is fun. Oh, hey, Rach, remember
that whole "we were on a break" thing?

337
Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?

338
That's not funny.

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
- What are you guys doing up?
- We wanted to finish the crossword before bed.

3
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

4
Dark-red.

5
I think that's wrong, but there's a
connect-the-dots in here for you later.

6
Hey, how, uh, about maroon?

7
- Yes! You are so smart!
- Ha-ha-ha.

8
Aw.

9
You guys are so cute.

10
I know.

11
All right. I'll see you in the morning.

12
Okay.

13
You know, I love doing crossword
puzzles with you, honey.

14
Oh, me too.

15
- Now, let's finish this and go to bed.
- Okay.

16
There's only one left.

17
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but...

18
Cat.

19
Yes. Ha.

20
You are so smart!

21
I love you.

22
I love you too.

23
Uh.

24
We still need a tip.

25
All right. Hold on.

26
I got it.

27
Nickel.

28
- How much more do we need?
- Couple of bucks.

29
Okay, dime.

30
You guys should probably keep talking.
This could take a while.

31
Wait, lookit!

32
Whoa!

33
Oh, my God. This is a police badge!

34
Oh, cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts. Ha.

35
Can you discover the badge again?

36
I think I can come up with something
better than that.

37
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

38
I should take it back.
Ooh, but while I'm at the police station...

39
...I could check their
Ten Most Wanted list.

40
My friend Fritzi's been Number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

41
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Joey.

42
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
Is that my sweatshirt?

44
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I borrowed it.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

45
It's just that, uh, if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

46
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

47
And I'm not him.

48
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

49
No, no. No.

50
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

51
Are you saying I smell bad?

52
No.

53
You smell like a meadow.

54
I'm sorry.

55
What's with him?

56
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

57
I still don't know.

58
I'm sorry, I just want to make sure
I bought the right couch, one that says:

59
"Kids welcome here,"
but that also says

60
"Come here to me."

61
What? You say that to kids?

62
No, no, no.

63
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

64
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

65
Well, you picked a great couch.

66
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

67
- Sign here please.
- Sure.

68
Oh, what's, heh...?

69
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

70
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

71
You know what? I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

72
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

73
Yeah.

74
Are you kidding?

75
Come on. It's only three blocks.
Uh, it's not very heavy. Try it.

76
- Oh, I can do it.
- Yeah.

77
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

78
We're, uh, not together.

79
Oh, okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

80
Something didn't quite add up there.

81
Ross.

82
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ross.

83
Well, you. Her. Heh.

84
I mean, she's very...

85
...you know.

86
And you're, like...

87
...you know?

88
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

89
Really? You two?

90
Yeah. Rach?

91
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

92
Then tell him quickly.

93
Fine. We went out.

94
Not only did we go out...

95
...we did it 298 times!

96
Ross.

97
Oh, my...

98
Ugh, you kept count?
You are such a loser!

99
A loser you did it with 298 times!

100
Oh. Oh!

101
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

102
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

103
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

104
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

105
Hold it!

106
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

107
What?

108
That's right. You are so busted.

109
Book them.

110
- Who are you talking to?
- Save it, red!

111
Unless you want to spend the night
in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.

112
I am not going to apologize to a tree.

113
You apologize to the tree right now,
or I am calling for backup.

114
Backup! Backup!

115
I'm sorry! Sorry!

116
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

117
Okay.

118
Didn't you say there was, um,
an elevator in here?

119
Uh, yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

120
Okay, go left.

121
Left. Left.

122
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

123
Lift it straight up over your head.

124
Straight up over your head. You can do it!

125
You can do it!

126
- Okay. You got it?
- Yeah.

127
- Go, go.
- Good, good.

128
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got...

129
Any chance you think
the couch looks good there?

130
This guy was all...

131
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

132
It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.

133
Phoebe, you were supposed to
take that back.

134
I know, but I'm having so much fun
doing good deeds.

135
Okay, but impersonating a police officer
is a serious thing. You can get arrested.

136
You could get arrested
right now!

137
All right, yeah, I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

138
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
Oh.

140
Hi, Joe.

141
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys were gonna be here.

142
- Do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this.
- What? Why?

143
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing.

144
You've been acting strange all day.

145
All right. There is something. I, uh...

146
I kind of had a dream.

147
But I don't want to talk about it.

148
Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

149
I kind of have a dream.

150
I don't want to talk about it.

151
Look, it involved Monica.

152
You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing?
Oh, that is so cool.

153
I can't tell you how many times
I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.

154
Anyway, we were talking about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

155
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it.
I haven't dreamt about her like that...

156
...since I found out
about you two-ish.

157
What was the dream about?

158
Well, okay.

159
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

160
Like you guys were doing last night.

161
So that's it. I'm in love
with Monica and I'll be moving out.

162
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
that you're in love with me.

163
It doesn't?

164
It could mean anything.
Like, uh...

165
...all of a sudden you're jealous
that I've become the apartment stud.

166
Kind of sounds like your dream, dude.

167
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me
together, being close and stuff...

168
...and you just wanna have that
with someone too.

169
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

170
Okay, look.

171
Are you attracted to Monica?

172
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

173
- Not really.
- There you have it!

174
Heh. Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

175
But that's good!

176
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

177
No, I don't think it's just about
getting a girlfriend.

178
Yeah, I could get a girlfriend.

179
Yeah, we could sit in the chair
and do crossword puzzles.

180
But are we ever gonna have
the closeness like you guys have?

181
Monica and I were friends before
we started dating. Maybe that's it.

182
Friends first?

183
That's interesting.

184
- You become friends after?
- No, never done that either.

185
Um, do you guys have
a tape measure?

186
Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

187
That's right.

188
What's up, Joey?

189
How you doing?

190
- Excuse me. Is this your car?
- Yeah.

191
Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

192
Don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

193
It's a problem for me, which means
it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.

194
So am I.

195
Oh, no.

196
Oh, okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

197
I know that because I'm a cop too.

198
All right. Keep up the good work.
Ten-four.

199
Wait a second.
So, what precinct are you with?

200
I'm with the, um, the 57th.

201
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.
- I'm in Vice.

202
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

203
Who else is in Vice up there?

204
Um, do you know, um...

205
...Sipowitz?

206
Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.

207
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

208
I don't know him.

209
Don't try to call him or anything.
Because he's not there. He's out.

210
His, um, partner just died.

211
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.

212
I sure will. Take care.

213
Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz
is gonna be all right.

214
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

215
Where'd you find my badge?

216
Oh!

217
Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me
and Ross a hand moving his couch?

218
Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

219
I guess I could blow that off for you.

220
Thanks.

221
Uh, let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

222
Boy, they are really tight.

223
I know.

224
That's not a bad situation
they got over there.

225
Mm-mm.

226
Thinking of getting me one of those.

227
What's up, Joe?

228
The reason I think Monica
and Chandler are so great...

229
...is because they were friends first,
you know?

230
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

231
I saw you first, so...

232
- Heh.
- Mm-hm.

233
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

234
You know, honey, um...

235
...as, uh, flattered as I am...

236
...that you saw me first...

237
...uh, I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

238
I'll treat you real nice.

239
Oh!

240
Yeah. Well, you know, um...

241
Listen, I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

242
But I think the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

243
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

244
Don't hit on your existing friends.

245
Won't that take longer?

246
Yeah. Yeah.

247
Oh, but once you find it...

248
...it's so worth the wait.

249
Yeah.

250
I understand.

251
Good.

252
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

253
Come here to me.

254
No, no. You come here to me.

255
Hey, Ross.

256
- Ahem, I brought reinforcements.
- Oh, great! You brought Joey?

257
I brought the next best thing. Heh.

258
Hey.

259
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

260
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so...

261
Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.

262
Rach, that's you.

263
That's the couch.

264
Oh, what's that?

265
Oh, that's me.

266
Wow.

267
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

268
No. That's my arm.

269
Oh, I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

270
Just follow my lead.

271
Okay.

272
Come on, Chandler.

273
Ah.

274
- All right.
- Okay.

275
Here we go.

276
All right. Ready?

277
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

278
- Turn!
- Okay.

279
Turn!

280
Turn!

281
- I don't think we can turn anymore!
- I don't think it'll fit!

282
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

283
Up! Yes!

284
Here we go! Pivot!

285
Pivot!

286
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

287
I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.

288
You think?

289
All right, let's, uh, bring it
back down and try again.

290
Oh.

291
Whoa.

292
I think it's really stuck now.

293
- I can't believe that didn't work.
- I know. Me neither.

294
I mean, you had a sketch.

295
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

296
- Hey.
- Hey.

297
How's it going?
Did you make any new friends?

298
Yeah. I met this woman.

299
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

300
What's she like?

301
Uh, well, she's...

302
...really good in bed.

303
I thought you were going to
try to be friends first.

304
- Hey, it's all your fault.
- What? Why?

305
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

306
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends."

307
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

308
And her roommate!

309
What about the "closeness"?

310
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

311
Who wants pizza?

312
I do! I do! I do!

313
This is great! Can you believe
I found this on the second floor?

314
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

315
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

316
Uh, just a minute, officer!

317
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

318
- I can't believe he found me!
- Are you going to go to jail?

319
If I'm going down,
you guys are going down with me.

320
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

321
Good luck, Chandler.

322
You can arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

323
I kind of don't have a choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

324
Yeah, as long as you understand
that I'm gonna call my lawyer.

325
And once he puts you on the stand, he's
gonna make you look like a fool! Like a fool!

326
I don't like looking foolish.

327
Maybe, uh, I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

328
I would love it if I weren't here!

329
Since, um, you're not going to jail
tonight, I was wondering if you'd, um...

330
...like to go to dinner with me?

331
- Me?
- Yeah.

332
Ever since you flashed my badge at me,
I kind of can't stop thinking about you.

333
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

334
Nice.

335
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

336
Yeah, I could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

337
Um, yeah, I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

338
- Gary.
- Gary.

339
- Okay, so it's a date.
- Yeah.

340
I gotta ask you, though.
How did you know where to find me?

341
Your fingerprints were all over my badge
so I ran them through the computer.

342
This was listed as your last known address
so I checked it out.

343
Oh, impressive.

344
Not as impressive as you. I looked at your
record and you've done some weird stuff.

345
We'll talk at dinner.

346
Okay.

347
So I'll come by in a couple hours
and pick you up?

348
- All right, I can't wait.
- Okay.

349
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

350
He has a gun!

351
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

352
You want to return this couch?

353
It's cut in half.

354
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Did you cut this couch in half?

355
This couch is cut in half!

356
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

357
You're telling me this couch
was delivered to you like this?

358
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

359
I will accept store credit.

360
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of $4.

361
I will take it.

﻿1
- Good! You guys are all here.
- Hey, what's up?

2
Well, I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.

3
- Oh!
- Congratulations!

4
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!

5
- What?
- Well, I got this pair marked "XS."

6
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.

7
Anyway, I'm gonna be the coordinator
of the women's collection.

8
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me.

9
Wow. Well, if you nail the interview,
you'll get it.

10
- Yeah.
- Want to work on your interview skills?

11
- Okay!
- Okay! Let's start with the handshake.

12
- Hi.
- Hi.

13
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.

14
- Thank you.
- Let me try.

15
Okay.

16
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?

17
Did I squeeze too hard?

18
Let's just say
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

19
That's right, Ross. I can see you
in your new apartment. You see me.

20
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.

21
Is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?

22
No. Oh, wait! There he goes.

23
Very funny, Ross.

24
Very lifelike and funny. Okay.

25
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.

26
Whoa, maybe I was. Hey!

27
Monica, this hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.

28
Get in there, man.
Flirt back. Mix it up!

29
Yeah, I'm down with that.

30
Okay, here it goes.

31
How...

32
...you...

33
...doing?

34
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.

35
Let's see,
she's on the third floor...

36
Wow.

37
- She is pretty, huh?
- Tell me about it, huh?

38
Oh, no, no.

39
No, no! I'm not with her.

40
Oh, that's just Monica.

41
Blah!

42
Hey, Joey!

43
Great stuff, huh?

44
- This is your place?
- Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in.

45
Ooh, ohh. Uh, go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.

46
But I counted.
You're not supposed to live here.

47
Oh, man!

48
- Unh!
- What happened?

49
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.

50
Damn! She's not there anymore.

51
Oh, look, Ross is doing
his "watching TV" bit.

52
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.

53
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.

54
Okay, now I really have to go.

55
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

56
...just because some guy
shot at a store clerk.

57
- I know, but it's my job.
- Then maybe I could come too?

58
Suspect has
just emerged naked from the sewer.

59
All right, you go.

60
- Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

61
- Oh, God!
- What?

62
Oh, I just miss him so much!

63
Wow.

64
For just a week,
you guys are close, huh?

65
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.

66
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?

67
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

68
Ugh, I love the beginning parts
of relationships, you know?

69
You can't keep your hands
off each other.

70
- I know. It is the best. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

71
God, how long did that last
for you and Chandler?

72
What? It's still going on.

73
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?

74
I am serious. We're all over
each other all the time.

75
Okay, you know where you are
better than I do. I was just curious.

76
Why don't you just calm down,
Phoebe, all right?

77
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.

78
God, I woke the beast. Um...

79
I was wrong obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.

80
Well, it is okay. I mean...

81
As long as you know Chandler and I
are also hot and fiery.

82
I mean, just as hot as you.

83
I mean, our flame...

84
Whoo! It is on fire!

85
Monica, here's your broom back.

86
You are so cute.

87
- Oh, hey! How'd the interview go?
- Ugh!

88
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.

89
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?

90
- No.
- So, what happened?

91
Ugh, it was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.

92
You know, like, I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...

93
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."

94
Trust me. It was actually very funny.

95
Anyway, so we were
saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.

96
- What happened?
- All right, we were shaking hands...

97
...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was going to open the door.

98
But I totally misread him and I, uh...

99
You kissed him?

100
I didn't know what else to do!

101
Well, you could have tried...

102
...not kissing him.

103
Thanks, Chandler.

104
Hey, Rach,
a guy from Ralph Lauren called.

105
You got a second interview.

106
- I can't believe it! I got a second interview.
- Yes!

107
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?

108
Wait a minute, wait. You don't think
that's why he wants me back?

109
Yeah!

110
No?

111
Kiss? What are you talking about?

112
Ugh, I accidentally kissed him
in the interview...

113
...and now he wants me back of course...

114
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody"!

115
Come on, Rach.

116
What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl
that'll just sleep with him?

117
He wants you back
because you're right for the job.

118
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

119
Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.

120
I think you just need a hug
from Joey. Heh.

121
Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.

122
She's back! Hot girl's back!

123
Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet.
But I appreciate it.

124
No, in Ross' building. She's back!
She's back!

125
Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.

126
One, two, three. Got it!

127
I gotta check out this hot girl.

128
There she is!

129
Damn it! Did you move?

130
Yes.

131
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.

132
I'm Ross.

133
Yes?

134
Uh...

135
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?

136
No, I'm all alone.

137
Yeah. Sorry about that.

138
Oh. Hey, little girl.

139
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter
by any chance, a hot girl?

140
- Daddy!
- Later, girl! Aah.

141
Oh, man!

142
Hot girl?

143
Hot girl!

144
- Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
- Hi. Okay.

145
- Ahem.
- It's nice to see you again.

146
Thank you.

147
Oh, Rachel, uh...

148
- What?
- Just, uh...

149
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, let me...

150
Whoa, eh, oh!

151
All right. Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, listen, look...

152
...I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

153
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.

154
- Now... Eh, eh!
- Well...

155
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...

156
...the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.

157
Good day, sir.

158
Ugh, you are not gonna believe...

159
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me.

160
Okay, that's amazing.
How did you know that?

161
You got ink on your lip.

162
Oh.

163
What do you say, maybe,
sometime I hold your gun?

164
I don't know.
We're not supposed to do that.

165
What could happen? I mean...

166
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.

167
Do you want to see a movie
after dinner tonight?

168
Oh, we can't. We already have plans.

169
What are you doing?

170
Um, well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.

171
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.

172
But have fun at the movie.

173
Uh, ha, ha.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.

174
You're not? Why did you ask us
if we wanted to go?

175
Oh, um, because I just wanted
to know what you were doing...

176
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...

177
...while we were doing it all night.

178
- Will you excuse me just a second? Okay.
- Yeah.

179
Chandler? Can I see you for a second?

180
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay, heh.

181
- We have got to beat them!
- Why?

182
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than we are.

183
- Oh! So?
- So?

184
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

185
You have got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.

186
Just to impress Gary and Phoebe...

187
...you want me to go upstairs
and have sex over and over...

188
...and I'm saying no to this why?
Get your coat!

189
- Hey.
- Hi.

190
Excuse me.

191
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.

192
Apparently, he's running around
looking for some kind of hot girl.

193
Who isn't?

194
I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.

195
I know. You're the guy who
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.

196
Never mind.

197
No, I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.

198
I mean, you had just moved in.

199
I had just moved in!

200
Thank you!

201
Listen, um...

202
- Jen.
- Jen.

203
I know this may sound a little:

204
But, uh, would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?

205
Sure, that would be nice.

206
- Um...
- Oh.

207
My number's on there.
Give me a call.

208
I will give you a call. Heh.

209
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

210
I forgot my paper.

211
- That was amazing.
- Ugh.

212
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.

213
That was amazing.

214
We are the hottest, huh?

215
No one is hotter than we are.

216
- We're the best.
- No, you're the best.

217
Aw.

218
- No, you're the best.
- No, you're the best.

219
I am the best.

220
Hey, guys.

221
What you been doing?

222
Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl
who waved at you the other day?

223
I don't know,
but I can see through your sheet.

224
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.

225
- I'm never gonna meet her anyways.
- Why?

226
Because it's impossible
to find her apartment!

227
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.

228
What are you talking about?

229
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.

230
No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.

231
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.

232
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.

233
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.

234
I almost lost another girl
because of counting!

235
So, uh, you ready?

236
- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
- Okay.

237
- Could you get that?
- Sure.

238
- Joey...?
- Aah! No! No!

239
Uh, first, I would like to say thank you
for agreeing to see me again.

240
That's, uh, quite all right.

241
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.

242
Okay. Um.

243
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...

244
...and, uh, for yelling at you.

245
Fair enough.

246
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who, uh...

247
Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...

248
...yell at you and storm out.

249
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.

250
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.

251
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.

252
That shows integrity.

253
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...

254
...and that shows courage.

255
Okay, ahem.

256
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...

257
...but you've got to have courage.

258
And, um, finally...

259
...when I thought you were making
sexual advances in the workplace...

260
...I said no, and I was not litigious.

261
So there you go. You got courage...

262
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...

263
...and not litigious.

264
Look, Mr...

265
- Zelner.
- Zelner!

266
I knew that!

267
Oh, I knew that.

268
I really, really want this job.

269
And I think I would be really good at it.

270
You know what?

271
I may regret this, but, uh...

272
...I'm gonna give you a shot.
- Oh, you are?

273
- Mm-hm.
- Really?

274
Oh, thank you. Oh, God!

275
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

276
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.

278
Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

279
Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!

280
There! Uh, there. Um...

281
Okay, so, thank you.

282
I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.

283
Hey, I'll see you Monday.

284
- Are you tired?
- You better believe he's tired...

285
...after the day we had!

286
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?

287
Honey? The tortilla chips
know what you mean.

288
So, uh, Chandler,
do you like that badge I got you?

289
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.

290
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.

291
That's pee-pee.

292
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.

293
Oh, ha, ha. Um...

294
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.

295
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so...

296
- You didn't.
- We did!

297
Ha, ha. We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.

298
- The park, huh?
- Ha, ha.

299
- Public place.
Uh-huh.

300
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?

301
Hi, Chandler.

302
Monica, this is the men's room.

303
Isn't it?

304
Yes, it is.

305
But see, I've always found
the men's bathroom very sexual.

306
- Haven't you?
- No.

307
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.

308
This is getting ridiculous.

309
- Come on, we can't let them win!
- Uh...

310
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?

311
Phoebe and Gary are in that "can't keep
their hands off each other" phase!

312
- So?
- So.

313
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.

314
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?

315
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were, you know...

316
...all over each other all the time?

317
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.

318
But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are now.

319
- Really?
- Yeah.

320
I've never been in a relationship
that's lasted this long before.

321
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other?

322
I think that's pretty incredible.

323
And the fact that
this is happening with you...

324
...I think that's pretty exciting.

325
That's so sweet.

326
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...

327
...but I feel the same way.
- Mm?

328
You know what I just realized?

329
You just freaked out
about our relationship.

330
- Pfft, I did not.
- Yes, you did!

331
Admit it. You freaked out!

332
I freaked out a little.

333
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?

334
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.

335
I am the relationship king,
and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!

336
And now we're back.

337
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.

338
- Thank God. I can't watch him anymore.
- Ha-ha-ha.

339
- You guys ready for the movies?
- Yeah.

340
Oh, by the way, thank you for
loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.

341
Man, they cannot get enough!

﻿1
- Pick a card.
- Okay.

2
All right. Now memorize it.

3
- You got it?
- Oh, yes.

4
Okay. Is that your card?

5
- Yes.
- Ha, ha.

6
- Hey, guys.
- Hi there.

7
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.

8
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's not for sure.

9
But, uh, we met this guy in the park
who thought Ben was really cute.

10
You know, which he is.
Um, anyhoo, he gave us his card...

11
...and told us to bring him down
for this commercial he's auditioning.

12
Whoa.

13
The guy's like the biggest commercial
casting director in town.

14
Ben takes one lousy walk
in the park and gets an audition?

15
I mean, way to go, Ben!

16
Man, I've been in that park a million times.
No one's ever offered me an audition.

17
I know, it's crazy.
We were just pushing Ben on the swings...

18
I'm always on the swings.

19
What am I doing wrong?

20
That.

21
- Okay, gotta go. Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

22
Hey, Rach, now that you working at
Ralph Lauren, can you get me some shirts?

23
Uh, well, you know what? I don't know
if I'd feel comfortable stealing...

24
...on my very first day.

25
Unwilling to steal from work.

26
Interesting.

27
Besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff,
it's me.

28
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.

29
- Go get them.
- Bye.

30
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

31
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.

32
Whoa, whoa. But her birthday's
not for another month.

33
Okay, but if we throw her a party
on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.

34
I think that's a great idea. We can have
a dinner party and invite her close friends.

35
Ross. We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.

36
- Okay.
- Done.

37
Okay, great.
So do you wanna do it together?

38
I would love to do it together.

39
They're gonna do it together.

40
Dude, that's my girlfriend.

41
So I gotta shut it down now?

42
All right, I gotta take off.
I'm picking up Ben...

43
...and then we're off to the big audition.

44
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.

45
- Yeah.
- Weirder than his two moms making out?

46
Whoa, whoa. Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?

47
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and pretend to enjoy it.

48
Well, maybe I'll go with you
and see if I can audition as the dad.

49
I mean, who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?

50
- You're not his godfather.
- What?

51
Are you kidding?

52
Of course I am.

53
- Okay, let's go, godfather.
- All right. Ha, ha.

54
Hey, I'm in.
They're gonna let me audition.

55
Really? That's great.

56
I know, I know. One of the casting ladies
has actually seen me in a play.

57
So I steered clear of her.

58
- That kid looks familiar.
- Oh, yeah.

59
Yeah, he's done tons of commercials.

60
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks,
PlayStation...

61
...and that one for the phone company.

62
In fact, he was so good in that one...

63
...he actually convinced me
to switch phone companies.

64
Chandler was mad.

65
Yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one.
All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid.

66
I mean, look at him.

67
That's great.

68
Listen, wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?

69
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.

70
I look more like him than you do.

71
Well, I really don't know you
well enough for you to do that.

72
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one...

73
...and I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?

74
Well, um, that one is pretty...

75
...but I just love this fabric. Sorry.

76
Oh, don't be. That's part of your job here,
to give your opinions.

77
And then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding. Ha, ha.

78
She is kidding. But don't ever
disagree with her again.

79
- Okay, now I'm kidding.
- Oh, ha, ha.

80
Oh, what a fun office.

81
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.

82
So, what do you say we take a break,
go outside...

83
...and figure this out when we come back.

84
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

85
- You smoke?
- No.

86
My dad's a doctor. And he would
always tell me just horror stories...

87
About ghosts and goblins...

88
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.

89
And then they came back
from smoking...

90
...and they'd made all of the decisions
without me.

91
- That doesn't seem fair.
- I know.

92
It's like I'm being punished for not having
this disgusting, poisonous habit.

93
Yeah, it is the best.

94
I mean, what if this keeps happening?

95
They'll be outside smoking,
making all the decisions...

96
...and I'll just be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.

97
You know? And when Kim wants
to promote one of us...

98
...who do you think she's gonna pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?

99
Rachel, you can go down there,
you don't have to smoke.

100
Just say you wanna get some fresh air.

101
Yeah, I could do that.

102
Yeah, or you could just do
the easy thing and smoke.

103
- Hey. Do you wanna go get coffee?
- Hey.

104
- Oh, I would love to.
- Oh, good.

105
- I'm gonna go too, babe.
- Oh, good.

106
- Yay.
- Yay.

107
Oh, I changed my mind.

108
Okay, let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.

109
- Ooh, me too.
- Oh!

110
- Yeah!
- Oh, look at that.

111
- All right. This is a little sketch of the cake.
- Uh-huh. Wow.

112
See? Um, some sample menus.

113
Um, you know, I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.

114
Okay. And for music, here's an
alphabetized list of all of my CDs.

115
I've highlighted the ones
that'll go really good with the food.

116
- What happened to the dinner party?
- We're not doing that.

117
- Okay? So...
- Wow. All right.

118
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.

119
Wait. I didn't take care of everything.

120
There's plenty of things for you to do.

121
Uh-huh? Like what?

122
Cups.

123
Cups. You're giving me cups?

124
And ice.

125
Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be
in charge of cups and ice?

126
All right.

127
Fine. Okay, I will be in charge
of cups and ice.

128
- Wait, I can get ice at the restaurant...
- I got it.

129
- Hi.
- Hey.

130
- How did the audition go?
- Not so good.

131
Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's:

132
"The audition didn't go so well.
Yeah, it did!"

133
Yeah, I am!

134
- Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
- Oh, great.

135
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit
because I actually didn't get a callback.

136
You got a callback too, didn't you?

137
Yeah, I did!

138
Hey, Rachel.
What are you doing out here?

139
You know, it got kind of lonely up there,
so I just thought I would come out here...

140
...and get some fresh air.

141
We were talking about
the fall collection.

142
- Oh, great.
- So anyway, we really...

143
- I'm sorry. We're smoking all over you.
- That's okay.

144
No, no, no. We'll move. You stay there.

145
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.

146
That's great. You are the best.

147
Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?

148
Actually, this one's...

149
Okay, okay, okay.
What's so funny over here?

150
I thought you didn't smoke.

151
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.

152
You know what I mean? Like, doobies?

153
Actually, I thought to myself,
"Those guys are crazy."

154
But no, actually, I smoke
the regular ones all the time.

155
We get high.

156
Me too.

157
- I'm kidding.
- Oh!

158
Me too.

159
Oh, God. This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?

160
Well, fortunately,
I don't get many callbacks so...

161
Is it a good sign that they asked us
to hang around after?

162
Who knows?

163
Okay. We have narrowed it down
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.

164
The rest of you, thank you very much.

165
Yes! I knew it!

166
Ah. Bye-bye.

167
So long.

168
Later.

169
This is great.
I might actually get to play Ben's dad.

170
Actually, that can't happen.

171
Because you all have
such different looks...

172
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.

173
So it'll either be you two or you two.

174
Oh, man.

175
- This is gonna be kind of weird.
- Yeah, it is.

176
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

177
No. We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.

178
Oh, oh.

179
I thought we were just talking.

180
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here
till Rachel's birthday party?

182
- Uh, sure. What's in them?
- Um, cups.

183
Oh, good, because we got Rachel
800 gallons of water.

184
Seriously, that's a lot of cups.

185
Yeah, well, I'm in charge of cups and ice.

186
And Monica's gonna rue the day
that she put me in charge of cups and ice.

187
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.

188
Okay, time to bring up
the rest of the cups.

189
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

190
- Hey.
- Ross, good, I'm glad you're here.

191
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Oh. What's up?

192
Well, I've been thinking about
this whole commercial thing.

193
You know me against Ben.

194
The two of us competing.
Well, that can't lead to anything good.

195
I think I'm just gonna step aside.

196
I'm gonna tell them
that I won't audition.

197
Wow. Uh...

198
Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.

199
That's it?

200
You're gonna let me do this?
This is my career we're talking about here.

201
But you just...

202
I just said that
so you wouldn't let Ben do it.

203
Look, Ross, if anyone should step aside,
it should be Ben.

204
- What?
- Chandler, tell him.

205
Well, let me get the door first.

206
Oh, hi, no one.

207
Why should Ben step aside?

208
It was his audition in the first place.
You just tagged along.

209
You're like the tag-along dad.

210
At least I care about his feelings.

211
What?

212
Do you know how hard this is gonna be
on him when he doesn't get it?

213
And why wouldn't he get it?

214
Oh, come on.

215
Have you seen what my kid can do?
Huh?

216
I mean, he dials phones,
he eats tortilla chips.

217
He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.

218
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?

219
You just give him a spoon, baby.

220
- Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see.
- Yeah.

221
Because this commercial belongs
to me and Mitch.

222
- Your kid's name is Raymond.
- Yeah? So is yours.

223
- How did work go?
- Oh, it was great. It was great.

224
I went down there just like you said.
And we talked business.

225
And Kim totally took my opinions.

226
You stink.

227
- Thanks.
- No, I'm serious.

228
That's because I went down there
and they were smoking.

229
This is actually the smell of success.

230
But there's something different, though.

231
Oh, my God. You smoked.

232
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

233
You look happy and sick. You smoked.

234
All right, fine. But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.

235
I wish I had to smoke for my career.

236
That's so gross.

237
Well, no, it's not that bad, you know?

238
I mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
and my fingers sort of smell.

239
I actually feel like I could throw up.

240
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.

241
Chandler.

242
You smell so smoky, I gotta get up.

243
I'm not kidding.

244
I think you smell great.

245
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.

246
Absolutely.

247
I'm so on board.

248
- Rachel, didn't you just light that?
- Yeah.

249
But you know what?

250
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.

251
Good luck, Rach.

252
I've actually been thinking
about quitting.

253
Oh, well, sure. Every Sunday night,
I tell myself I'm quitting.

254
Every Monday morning, it's like:

255
Tell me about it.

256
Well, let's quit. We'll just quit.
Let's all quit.

257
It does sound appealing.

258
- I never could do it.
- But you could. You can. Absolutely.

259
We can help each other out.
We could get those patches.

260
We could be like the Patch Sisters.

261
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit.

262
Yes. Great. Give me those cigs.
Come on.

263
Give it. Give it. Out. Done. Quit. Whoo!

264
- My late husband gave me that lighter.
- Ha, ha.

265
I'm not kidding.

266
Okay, then. Okay.

267
Mm, soup.

268
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second.

269
Would you mind watching Ben
while I use the ladies' room?

270
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

271
Mm.

272
Hi, Ben.

273
So you want to be an actor, huh?
Well, I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.

274
There's tons of rejection. No stability.

275
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.

276
The next day, you're eating ketchup
right out of the bottle.

277
Joey.

278
Ross.

279
Ben.

280
I mean, Ben. Ben.

281
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're up.

282
- Hi.
- Okay.

283
All right, well, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.

284
- Uh-oh.
- Is there a problem?

285
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.

286
But that's okay.
No problem. No problem.

287
Mm, noodle soup.

288
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mm, soup."

289
- Oh. What'd I say?
- Mm, noodle soup.

290
How's that different?

291
Oh. Right. Yeah.

292
All right. Let's try one.

293
Mm, noodle soup.

294
Okay. Let's do it again.

295
Okay.

296
Mm, soup.

297
I mean, noodle soup. I mean, soup.

298
Come on!

299
You know what?
We need to move on.

300
Oh, no, I could do it one more time.

301
See, look.

302
Mm, noodle soup.

303
Damn it.

304
Hey. Hey.

305
Uh-oh. Busted.

306
Come on, you guys. What are you doing?

307
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.

308
Yeah, that didn't work out.

309
Rachel, we tried to quit.
But it was too hard.

310
Well, if you started smoking again,
you could have at least told me.

311
Come on, give me one of those.
What are we talking about?

312
No, you're doing great. Don't give up.

313
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we are not gonna drag you down.

314
Oh, wait. No, no. Drag me down.
Drag me down.

315
Forget it, Rachel. We're both so proud
of how well you're doing.

316
I'm not gonna let you blow it.
In fact, if I catch you, you're fired.

317
So go on, get out of here. Go on.
I don't want you breathing this stuff. Go on.

318
So okay. So you'll come with me
on the Paris trip?

319
Oh, man.

320
Hey, check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...

321
...cup chandelier and the thing
that started it all. The cup.

322
- Great job with the cups, Pheebs.
- Ha, ha.

323
Why don't you just go out with her?

324
Did you notice the ice? Look.

325
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.

326
Ah.

327
Mystical.

328
No one's eating my Tuscan finger food.
They're filling up on Phoebe's snow cones.

329
There are snow cones?

330
Snow cones. Yuck.

331
- Go, go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

332
- Look, look.
- Surprise.

333
What? My birthday is not
for another month.

334
That's the surprise.

335
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is so great. It's so unexpected.

336
I mean, Chandler's birthday's
even before mine.

337
Surprise.

338
Wow. This is so great.
Look at all these...

339
...cups. This is so weird.

340
I was in charge of cups.

341
Oh, okay. Not so weird.

342
- Hey.
- Hey.

343
Listen, man. I'm sorry
the audition didn't go well.

344
Yeah, right.

345
No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.

346
Well, look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?

347
It's not your fault I suck.

348
What kind of an actor can't even say,
"Mm, noodle soup"?

349
Hey, you know what? Maybe you didn't
mess up your audition because you suck.

350
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.

351
- What do you mean?
- I think, subconsciously...

352
Whoa, you lost me.

353
I think, on some level, you sabotaged...

354
...your own audition
so Ben would get the part.

355
Well, your way sounds
a lot better than mine.

356
Yeah.

357
- Yeah. It's not that I'm a bad actor.
- No.

358
No, it's just that, uh, I care
so damn much about little Ben...

359
...that, uh, it was more important
for me to see him succeed.

360
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
- So did he get it?
- No.

362
Ah, what are you gonna do?

363
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Is Rachel Green here?
I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.

364
Oh, she doesn't come down anymore.
You can find her up on 10.

365
Okay, great.

366
So we talked
about the presentation at lunch.

367
He wondered if one person would be
enough for me to take on the trip.

368
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."

369
I'll catch you guys later.

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
Wow, you look nice.
What's the occasion?

3
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

4
- Got reservations at Jean-George.
- Wow.

5
- How'd you get in?
- Oh.

6
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

7
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

8
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey, Caitlin.

9
Somebody got a haircut.

10
Ugh. I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.

11
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

12
- It's, uh, $27 even.
- Oh, okay. Here you go.

13
Where's the chicken?

14
Oh, it's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

15
He said that eggs came first.

16
- Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

17
What the hell was that?

18
- What?
- The flirting.

19
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, hmm, let's see, my sister?

20
I was not flirting.

21
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut..."

22
First of all, the impression? Uncanny.

23
Second, that wasn't flirting. That was just
casual conversation between two people.

24
Oh! Yeah, right.

25
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you flirting.

26
I'm good. I'm okay.

27
I am so proud of Joey.

28
- He's gonna be on Law and Order!
- I know.

29
But don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?

30
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

31
Yeah. Don't get me started on that.

32
- I was not flirting.
- And on your anniversary. For shame!

33
What's going on?

34
Chandler was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

35
I was not. And oh, God! Shh!

36
I'm sorry, but you were. And besides,
if anyone should be hitting on her...

37
...it's the guy who's single...

38
...the guy who can do something about it.

39
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

40
Well...

41
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

42
Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years
ago. You've been married since then.

43
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

44
- I was watching her at the pizza place.
- Mm-hm.

45
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little...

46
We don't need her measurements.
Ha, ha.

47
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

48
I know she's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

49
She forgot my vegetarian.

50
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

51
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

52
Oh, I am so glad you don't eat meat.
Ha, ha.

53
- See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
- Mm.

54
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

55
- Big night!
- Yeah, it's so cool.

56
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be very proud.

57
Chandler, she doesn't understand
a word of English.

58
Ha, ha, I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

59
I've done it again.

60
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

61
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

62
Big star.

63
My big fat Joey star.

64
Yeah. Yeah.

65
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

66
Hey.

67
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary, 10 months.

68
- Oh! Mm.
- Mm.

69
Um, in the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

70
Oh, uh, Joey's grandmother's
right there.

71
- The one who speaks English?
- The one who doesn't.

72
That was some hot love you gave me.
Ha-ha-ha.

73
- I'll get ready.
- Wear those earrings I got you.

74
Oh, that's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

75
Mm.

76
- You've got to go home.
- But I like it here.

77
Go home and get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

78
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

79
Okay.

80
Ahem, Rach. Hi.

81
I need those earrings you borrowed.

82
Oh. Um...

83
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
- Yeah, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

85
Wow, Pheebs, you speak Italian?

86
I guess so.

87
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Wait, where's the other one?

88
Oh, what, you want both of them? Ha, ha.

89
Rachel Karen Green,
where's the other earring?

90
Okay, okay. Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

91
Oh, I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

92
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

93
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.
- These are her earrings.

94
No. No.

95
You lent me Monica's earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.

96
- Why not?
- Because I lose her stuff!

97
He, uh, left a little after 2.

98
You see that blind guy right there?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

99
Oh, uh, my big scene's coming up.
Uh, the big scene coming up.

100
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
would she know the difference?

101
Rach, what are you doing?

102
Oh, I just can't watch. It's too scary.

103
- Huh.
- It's a diaper commercial.

104
Oh, yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities...

105
- Pizza delivery.
- I'll get it! I will get that!

106
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
- One vegetarian pizza. It's 12.50.
- Ah.

108
Uh, by the way, if it makes
you feel any better, uh...

109
...I happen to like 8-year-old boys.

110
What?

111
Oh, I mean... No, no, no. The, uh...

112
Your hair. Before. Your hair.

113
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

114
...and I'm just saying I like it.

115
The hair.

116
Oh. Thanks.

117
You understand, I don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

118
All I'm looking for is the money.

119
Here you go.
Now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.

120
- I'm gonna try. Ha, ha.
- Okay.

121
You're welcome.

122
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

123
- What?
- This is a girl I really like...

124
...and you had to swoop in there!
- What's going on?

125
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

126
Thank you for that.

127
I was not flirting.

128
It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.

129
- Really?
- Really?

130
It's no big deal. I do it all the time.

131
So, uh... Ahem.
You flirt with guys all the time?

132
Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like
I know it doesn't mean anything with you.

133
But there's a big difference.
You're a lot hotter.

134
True story.

135
Ha, ha. This actually bothers you?

136
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

137
When you were going out with Ross, did it
bother you when he flirted with other women?

138
Uh, no. No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

139
And thank you for that.

140
But I never had anything to worry about.

141
Ross was never very good
at the flirting thing.

142
What...? What...? Ha, ha.

143
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

144
Oh. No, you're right.

145
We met, you flirted and then,
bam, nine years later, you had me.

146
All right. All right.

147
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna order another pizza.

148
And when Caitlin gets here...

149
...I will show you how well I flirt.

150
- I will get her phone number.
- Oh, well...

151
And not the one on the menu.

152
- I found it.
- Oh, thank God! Where was it?

153
On your dresser.

154
- Okay, that is the one we already have.
- Oh.

155
Okay, here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

156
- What do you bet nobody heard anything?
- No bet.

157
Anybody home?

158
- Oh, my God.
- What?

159
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out. Ha, ha.

160
- Oh, what is it?
- Uh, they cut me out of the show.

161
What?

162
- Are you sure?
- Maybe your scene's coming up.

163
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

164
- Yeah.
- I'm in it.

165
This is terrible. What'll you do?

166
I don't know. But this little old lady
lives for my career.

167
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.

168
That's not good.

169
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.

170
Why don't you just tell her what happened?
It's not your fault.

171
If we keep talking this way,
aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

172
Oh, uh, soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

173
There I am!

174
No.

175
Sam Waterston!

176
Oh, no, no. That's me. That's me!

177
No. Sam Waterston.

178
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

179
She doesn't know "hello,"
but she knows Capricorn One.

180
- Phoebe.
- Hmm?

181
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

182
But I already gave them back to you.

183
No, you didn't.

184
All right, I already didn't gave them
back to you. That's what I said.

185
Ahem. Where's that other earring?

186
It's not here, Pheebs. It's not here. Oh!

187
I went to Chandler's last night.

188
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

189
Wait a minute, Chandler has a jewelry box?

190
Okay, we have 10 minutes.
Do you want me to get into that now?

191
Hey, Pheebs.

192
How's that, uh...

193
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you, huh?

194
You and those, uh, vegetables
have a real, uh...

195
...thing going on, huh?

196
Why are you being weird?

197
Do you like it?

198
No. That would be,
"Why are you being cute?"

199
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

200
Oh! I did not get that.

201
So, uh, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?

202
- Yeah, it's good.
- Oh.

203
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...

204
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

205
Shh. Shh.

206
Okay, let me get this straight.

207
It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?

208
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.

209
Look, I'm sorry, but some things
are different for men and women.

210
Go on, teach me about men and women.

211
Okay. I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

212
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

213
But the guy thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

214
- No way!
- It's true.

215
- Well, that's pathetic.
- Again, true.

216
- This goes for all guys?
- All guys that are awake.

217
Then we go to sleep.

218
All guys from the other end of the world
wake up and behave the exact same way.

219
All right. It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

220
Joey, this is the last commercial.

221
- You got, like, 10 minutes left.
- I know!

222
What am I gonna do? Oh!

223
You are not gonna run out
and leave her here.

224
Yeah, all right. Oh!

225
Joey?

226
Uh, Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

227
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

228
So, you're old and small.

229
- Hey.
- Did you find it?

230
The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.

231
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

232
Those are my sunglasses.
You borrowed them from me.

233
Okay. Calm down. Here they are.

234
Phoebe.

235
- What do we do?
- I don't know. I don't know!

236
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.

237
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

238
- Oh.
- I could tell her it was all my fault.

239
Oh, that'd be great.

240
Mon, could I talk to you?

241
- Yeah. What is it?
- Um...

242
I lost one of your earrings.

243
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

244
Wow.

245
All right, well, I mean, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

246
I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.

247
That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.

248
- No.
- Oh.

249
Look at you. Come here.

250
Aw.

251
- You feel better? Ha, ha.
- Yeah. You're the best.

252
Okay, wait a minute.

253
Wait a minute, I can't do this.

254
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.

255
She lent me the earrings.

256
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

257
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

258
First it's my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

259
And if it's not my sweater,
it's my sunglasses.

260
- Your sunglasses?
- Yes.

261
Oh, right.

262
- Pizza.
- Mine, mine, mine!

263
Okay, here goes.

264
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

265
Okay, hold on.

266
Okay.

267
If you really like this girl,
I don't think flirting is the right way...

268
Ah! Ah! Ah!

269
You'll see.

270
Okay.

271
Oh, what's her name?

272
Caitlin!

273
Caitlin.

274
Hey.

275
Oh, we can't keep eating like this.
Ha, ha.

276
Heh. It's, uh, $12.50.

277
Okay, um...

278
So...

279
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?

280
No, actually, I think they're gas.

281
Gas? Wow, ha, ha.

282
Intense.

283
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

284
Hey, uh...

285
You know that smell gas has?

286
Yeah.

287
They put that in.

288
What?

289
The gas is odorless.

290
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

291
Well, okay.

292
A lot of other gas smells.

293
Oh, the humanity.

294
Methane smells...

295
You know what?
Um, actually, I really should go.

296
- Oh, but I haven't paid you yet.
- That's okay.

297
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

298
Last I heard...

299
...the cops had over 600
reported missing women still.

300
Six hundred.

301
Was I talking to her about gas?

302
More so than anything else.

303
I found it interesting.

304
I'm sorry.

305
Hey, hey. Don't worry about it.

306
In nine years, she and I
will be right there! Ha, ha.

307
Okay. Well, I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

308
- Ross?
- Yeah?

309
What else do they add smell to?

310
Caitlin! Caitlin! Hi.

311
Hi, I'm Rachel. Oh.

312
From upstairs, people with all the pizza.

313
Oh, was there a problem?

314
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

315
But, actually, um, my friend Ross...

316
...he just gets really nervous
when he's flirting.

317
Oh, my God! That was flirting?

318
- Yeah.
- Wow.

319
I know, I know.

320
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

321
...where it just feels like you wanna die...

322
...he's a really good person.

323
- The guy with the gas?
- Yeah.

324
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

325
...and he's just, oh, got a good heart.

326
- And besides, I think he really likes you.
- Really?

327
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

328
I thought Joey was there.

329
You've got till Monday.
Then I move to dismiss.

330
Hey, Ross?

331
Um, I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

332
Uh, you must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought. Ha, ha.

333
- What?
- I don't get it...

334
...but she wanted me
to give you her phone number.

335
Oh.

336
And she just gave you this?

337
Yeah.

338
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

339
I didn't. I didn't. She thought you were cute.

340
Well, that I can believe.

341
Yeah.

342
Hey, is the show still on?

343
Almost over, man.

344
Hey, Nonnie.

345
Oh! Is that the Pope?

346
Hey.

347
Why am I looking?

348
Oh, Nonnie, here I am!
This is my big scene.

349
All right, back off!

350
I got a gun!

351
I'm not afraid to use it.

352
Oh, Joey.

353
That's right, Nonnie.

354
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

355
Now, I want a suitcase
filled with $100,000...

356
Shh! Shoo, shoo!

357
Filled with $100,000 in small bills.

358
And if I don't get... Shoo!

359
And if I don't get it...

360
...I'm gonna shoot this duck!

361
Oh, no!

362
I'm coming out!

363
And she's supposed to buy this?

364
Ground control to Major Tom

365
Commencing countdown

366
Engines

367
On

368
That's, uh, scenes
from next week's show. Next week.

369
I am definitely gonna watch that.

370
What about these?
Do these look the same?

371
- Definitely.
- Not as each other.

372
Oh, then, no.

373
- Hey, you ready?
- Hi. Yeah.

374
- You look amazing.
- Aw.

375
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

376
- Oh, you're about to get a little luckier.
- Mm-hm.

377
- Let me see the earrings.
- Oh, right, the earrings.

378
They look great.

379
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?

380
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.

381
- Thanks for picking out the earrings.
- Mm-hm.

﻿1
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2
You look cute in bubbles.

3
Ahh, you're just all liquored up.

4
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

5
I've had a very long, hard day.

6
Want some chicken?

7
No, thanks. No chicken. Bye-bye.

8
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

9
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

10
All right.

11
Are you okay? He wouldn't leave.

12
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

13
Chicken?

14
I could eat some chicken.

15
Hey, Joe!

16
Could I get a, uh, three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

17
Aah! Diet Coke.

18
- Hey.
- Hey.

19
- Morning, Pheebs.
- I have to tell you this story.

20
I was coming over
and this cabdriver...

21
Was his name Angus?

22
What?

23
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

24
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.

25
All right. Anyway...

26
What was that pub he took us to?

27
The Wheat Sheaf!

28
And they had that beer...

29
- Boddington's.
- Boddington's.

30
Ooh, uh,
Pheebs was going to tell a story.

31
So he had a really funny hat.

32
I don't want to talk about it.

33
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross!

34
Boddington's!

35
Oh, man!

36
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

37
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

38
Later!

39
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

40
Her plane got delayed.

41
But she should be here by now.

42
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

43
No. But she likes me.

44
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

45
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

46
Emily showed up at the airport.

47
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

48
She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.

49
Emily!

50
Emily is my wife.

51
Man, what is that?

52
You haven't heard from Emily?

53
Not since I lost her at the airport.

54
I can't believe she can outrun you.

55
Hey! She's fast, okay?

56
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

57
Hi!

58
Hi! Rachel!

59
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

60
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

61
Hi, Pheebs.

62
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

63
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

64
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

65
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

66
So, what, that's it?

67
Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.

68
Thanks, Rach. You're the best.

69
Oh, no. You're the best.

70
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

71
No one will tell me where Emily is...

72
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

73
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

74
That should get her talking.

75
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily."

76
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

77
What?

78
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

79
Ross abandoned me!

80
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

81
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

82
I mean, it was so humiliating!

83
I felt like such an idiot!

84
It's all my fault. You know why?

85
Because I make very bad decisions.

86
Oh, that's not true.

87
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

88
London is stupid! Stupid!

89
I should've never gone to London.

90
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

91
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

92
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

93
I'll do it.

94
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

95
Okay. I got to go to work.

96
And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.

97
Pheebs!

98
Always a pleasure.

99
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

100
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

101
He's married.

102
Ross is married. I still can't believe it.

103
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

104
I'll just have to accept it.

105
I mean, it's my fault.

106
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

107
Oh, my God!

108
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

109
I know that wasn't about me.

110
I bet it was about her a little.

111
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

112
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

113
Look. Gunther.

114
He's nice. He's cute.

115
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...

116
What about that guy over there?

117
That's the guy
you flirted with at the counter.

118
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

119
You're going to talk to him.

120
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.

121
All right.

122
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

123
Say that to him, and you're golden.

124
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
Hey, Pheebs.
We got our pictures back from London.

126
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London...

127
Here we all are.

128
There's Ross and Joey and you and...

129
And me.

130
We've been talking about
London too much.

131
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

132
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

133
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

134
- What happened?
- A little of this, a little of that.

135
I got myself a date tomorrow.

136
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

137
Get out.

138
What took so long?

139
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

140
So thanks for having me over.

141
Rach...

142
Pheebs...

143
See you, man.

144
What the hell was that?

145
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

146
That's not European.

147
It felt French.

148
I really had a good time.

149
Yeah, me too.

150
- So...
- So...

151
I guess this is it.

152
Yeah, um...

153
- Unless you want to come inside?
- Yeah!

154
Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

155
Okay. Just hold on a second.

156
Um, hi.

157
Hi.

158
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

159
Doing her laundry.

160
What's that?

161
It came in the mail today.

162
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.

163
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

164
...cut up into mulch.

165
Honey, that's awful.

166
It's not so bad.

167
Monica's going to make potpourri.

168
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

169
It's not raining.

170
I can't catch a break.

171
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

172
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

173
All right?

174
Okay.

175
- Hey, Dave.
- Yeah.

176
Um, I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

177
Okay. Bye.

178
Honey, listen.

179
I know things seem so bad...

180
...and that they won't get any...

181
Could I talk to you?

182
I dropped some socks.

183
Yeah.

184
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

185
You did not drop any socks!

186
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

187
You listen to me!

188
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

189
What are you doing?

190
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

191
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

192
What? You cannot tell him that!

193
Why? Why not?

194
People love to hear that!

195
I make the decisions and I say no!

196
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

197
...you're fired.

198
You can't fire me.

199
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired. Ha!

200
Well...

201
Rachel! Come on, let me in!

202
Having some trouble?

203
Rachel locked the door.

204
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

205
Rachel! Let me in!

206
Thank you.

207
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

208
No.

209
We really need to talk.

210
Well, then talk.

211
Okay, I will.

212
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

213
Yes.

214
What thing?

215
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

216
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

217
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

218
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

219
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

220
I have to use the phone.

221
I got to cancel those five, giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

222
My God. Think of the massacre.

223
I'm going to do it.

224
I know you think I'm crazy.

225
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

226
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

227
Please?

228
All right. Fine.

229
Joey! I'm in!

230
All right. Good deal.

231
Pheebs! Hey!

232
- Uh, Pheebs?
- Yeah?

233
Um, you know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

234
...and you were feeling left out?
- Yeah.

235
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

236
...so we decided to
take a little trip together.

237
Oh, that's so nice!

238
How great! Where's the trip?

239
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

240
...in Central Park!
- Central Park?

241
All of us. All day.

242
That sucks!

243
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

244
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

245
It's right by my house. All right!

246
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

247
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

248
I wanted to talk to you about...

249
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

250
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

251
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

252
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

253
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

254
It makes me want to puke.

255
Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!

256
- Phoebe! Whoo!
- Okay. Whoo! Hi!

257
Pheebs, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little...

258
It didn't have any... Well, it blew.

259
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

260
...to Atlantic City.

261
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan!
Whose plan was that?

262
Mine!

263
- Wait. It was my plan.
- No...

264
...I said we needed a new plan.

265
And I came up with Atlantic City.

266
Which is the new plan.

267
Why don't we, um, all
meet upstairs in an hour?

268
Okay.

269
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

270
Let's go.

271
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

272
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

273
You know what? That doesn't matter.

274
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

275
...and not have them say it back?

276
I don't care.

277
Okay...

278
I can't watch.

279
What you reading?

280
Paper.

281
Yeah? What's it about?

282
The events from around the globe.

283
Okay...

284
Uh, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

285
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

286
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

287
Once at work...

288
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized...

289
I'm really trying
to tell you something here.

290
Yeah...

291
Go ahead.

292
I think I'm just going to say it.

293
I'm just going to say it.

294
Uh...

295
I'm still in love with you, Ross.

296
Wow, uh...

297
Huh. I'm...

298
Wow. I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

299
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

300
I'm so dead serious.

301
I'm totally serious.

302
Why are you laughing?

303
Because I just heard it!

304
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!

305
I mean...

306
You're married!

307
You're married, and it's just ridiculous.

308
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

309
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel...

310
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

311
- Well, I am married.
- I know.

312
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

313
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

314
Actually, it kind of is.

315
My wife won't return my calls.

316
I don't know where my wife is.

317
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

318
Oh, God.

319
Okay.

320
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

321
Well, I kind of have to.

322
Because the thing is...

323
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

324
That is what the thing is.

325
Oh, God.

326
Things won't be weird between us, right?
Was that stupid?

327
Me telling you that?

328
No, no. I'm glad you did.

329
If nothing else...

330
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

331
That's what I said!

332
- Thank you for being so nice.
- No. Thank you for...

333
Thank you.

334
- Okay, let's go!
- Yeah, Atlantic City!

335
Come on!

336
Atlantic City, baby!

337
Let's roll some bones. Hey, Joey!

338
High-five for rolling bones.

339
- Ow!
- Ow!

340
Oh.

341
Ooh!

342
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking.

343
Oh, my God. Your water broke.

344
Oh! Okay!

345
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

346
Pheebs, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

347
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

348
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

349
Whoo!

350
Remember when my water broke?

351
Phoebe's going to have her babies.

352
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

353
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left the room.

354
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

355
Do you know anything about women?

356
No.

357
- It's all right.
- Okay.

﻿1
Okay, guys, listen.

2
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

4
- Okay.
- Good idea.

5
Hey, man. What's up?

6
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

7
Oh, Ross. Look, look.

8
What? Where?

9
Right over there. There.
Look, look, look.

10
- What am I looking at?
- Somebody help me out here.

11
- Hey.
- Hey.

12
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

13
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

14
- You got to go on a ride-along?
- Uh-huh.

15
- I want to go on a ride-along.
- Me too.

16
- Okay.
- Yeah. Me too.

17
Really? You?

18
Yeah.

19
- Well, it's kind of dangerous.
- Well, I like danger.

20
- Okay, you guys free tonight?
- Yeah.

21
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

22
- Hey.
- Hey.

23
I'm glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

24
Oh, thank God.

25
Finally.

26
I've broken them down
into categories.

27
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids...

28
And I've cross-referenced them
by subject.

29
So if you're looking up, say...

30
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

31
See?

32
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
Wow, I miss that dog.

34
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead."

35
Great. Thanks.

36
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

37
Oops.

38
Sorry.

39
Good thing you numbered them.

40
I hadn't.

41
Photo 152 was a prototype.

42
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

43
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

44
Ross has the blender.

45
Everything's just falling apart.

46
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

47
- You get the margarita stuff ready.
- All right.

48
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

49
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

51
- What?
- What?

52
I don't do that.

53
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

54
It is starting to get dark out there.

55
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

56
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

57
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
- Want me to grab the berry?
- It's called a cherry.

59
It's called... Chandler.

60
Okay, I got it.

61
This place makes
the best sandwich in the world.

62
Does it have meatballs?

63
Oh, yeah.

64
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
Yep.

66
You can't eat that in my car.

67
Yeah, okay.

68
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

69
Your tax dollars?

70
Yeah, okay.

71
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
Did I say you could smell it?

73
I can't smell it?

74
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
Okay, I'll give them back.

76
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
- Okay. Imagine the best sex you ever had.
- Okay.

78
- Are you thinking about Monica?
- Yeah.

79
What's that like?

80
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

81
Please, please, please.

82
"Made in Mexico." Yes!

83
Who would buy this?

84
Rach, it's me. Pick up.

85
What's up?

86
I need more margarita things.

87
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

88
So all we had was ice?

89
See if he has ice.

90
Okay.

91
Hello, Ross?

92
It's Emily here.

93
I know this is out of the blue,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

94
Well, maybe I am...

95
I keep thinking about you.

96
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.

97
Are you thinking about me?

98
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.

99
Okay, bye.

100
Where we going?

101
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

102
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

103
Come on, man.

104
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

105
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

106
Yeah. No one talks like that.

107
- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
- I'm more cop than you two.

108
How do you figure that?

109
I'm in the front seat, okay?

110
I'm Gary's partner.

111
When you say "partner,"
it doesn't sound cop.

112
It sounds gay.

113
Um, jealous.

114
- Hey, we're undercover here.
- Oh, yeah. No problem.

115
- Ross.
- Sorry.

116
There.

117
Hey, Gary. Who am I?

118
Phone home.

119
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

120
What's up with that, Serpico?

121
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.

122
But if you are, call me tonight.

123
Okay, bye.

124
No.

125
I know.

126
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

127
What? We can't do that.

128
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

129
...and calls her
and they get back together?

130
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

131
...neurotic, crazy Emily
who wouldn't let him see you?

132
No. Oh, no, no.

133
God, no. He should not
get back with her.

134
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

135
But we have no right
to erase his message.

136
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

137
Doesn't that give me
the right to control...

138
Help him?

139
He's not the one who needs help.

140
She's obviously unstable.

141
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

142
Okay, fine. But look at
the position she's putting him in.

143
And what's he gonna do?

144
Break up their marriage
on their wedding day?

145
Who would do that?

146
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

147
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

148
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

149
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

150
I mean, listen.

151
Your messages have been erased.

152
No.

153
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

154
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.

155
What is it?

156
It says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

157
...or get your head blown off.

158
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

159
Here he comes.

160
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

161
What is it?

162
- Is everything okay?
- What?

163
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him.

164
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.

165
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

166
You see that?

167
You see what he did?

168
You okay, man?

169
Uh-huh.

170
Thanks, Joey.

171
Uh... Hello?

172
Hi.

173
We should go.

174
No, wait.

175
Oh, yeah. Right.

176
No. Monica.

177
Monica, we have to fix this.

178
What can we do?
You erased the message.

179
Unless we tell him.

180
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

181
All right?

182
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

183
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

184
Hey, Ross, it's you.

185
I just want you
to remember this feeling.

186
You are lucky to be alive.

187
So live every day to the fullest.

188
Love yourself, okay?

189
And also get stamps. Bye.

190
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

191
Right?

192
Anybody want to meet a hero?

193
John Glenn is here?

194
No. Joey.

195
We had the most incredible night.

196
- We're in the car...
- Wait. Hold on.

197
- Hi.
- Hi.

198
Okay, go ahead.

199
So we're in the car, and bang.
A shot was fired.

200
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

201
...throws himself on me.

202
My God.

203
It was a car backfire.

204
But he didn't know that.

205
Yeah, I didn't know that.

206
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

207
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

208
Who jumps at loud noises.

209
Wow. I could have died tonight.

210
If the car that backfired
had run over you.

211
I'm going before he starts rambling
about his newfound respect for life.

212
I do have a newfound respect for life.

213
Oh, my God.

214
- You want to get some dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

215
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

216
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

217
Okay.

218
- Bye.
- Bye.

219
Cut it out.

220
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

221
Dude.

222
Why'd you take off?

223
Just going for a walk.

224
Around the living room, whatever.

225
- Is something wrong?
- No. No, I'm just tired.

226
You know, from the walk.

227
Okay.

228
You dove in front of Ross.

229
Ross.

230
That's what this is about.

231
Oh, my God. You hate Ross.

232
I don't hate Ross.

233
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

234
You want Ross out of the picture.

235
What picture?

236
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

237
I'm glad you saved Ross.
But it could've been a bullet.

238
And you didn't try to save me.

239
Oh.

240
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

241
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

242
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

243
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

244
That's the bottom line.

245
No, not exactly.

246
All right, look.

247
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

248
Okay?

249
My sandwich was next to Ross.

250
All right?

251
I was trying to save my sandwich.

252
From a bullet?

253
- I know it doesn't make much sense.
- "Much" sense?

254
Chandler, it was instinct.
I just went for it.

255
You risked your life for a sandwich?

256
I know it sounds crazy...

257
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world.

258
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

259
No. I would never do that.

260
You're like my brother.

261
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me...

263
Here.

264
- Thanks.
- Easy, it's not a hot dog.

265
How good is that?

266
Oh, yeah.

267
See?

268
What are you doing?

269
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

270
With a bite.

271
Jeez.

272
Hi.

273
What are you doing here?

274
Hey, you know what?

275
You are in our apartment
all the time.

276
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister.

277
It doesn't matter. The important thing
is that you're here.

278
You're my friend and you're here.

279
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

280
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

281
I thought my number was up.

282
I had an actual near-death experience.

283
What happened?

284
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me.

285
Really?

286
No. A car backfired.

287
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

288
...I survived.

289
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

290
I want to experience every moment.

291
I want to seize every opportunity.

292
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

293
Because a car backfired?

294
Okay. Why are you here?

295
I don't know how this fits
into your whole seizing thing...

296
...but Emily called you today.

297
- You talked to her?
- She left a message.

298
But it kind of got erased.

299
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

300
What did she say?

301
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding.

302
And did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

303
And she wants you to call her.

304
Wow.

305
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

306
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

307
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Because...

308
I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.

309
Because she didn't want...

310
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

311
Okay?

312
I was right.

313
Your decision.

314
Right.

315
I guess I should call Emily.

316
No, that's not the right decision.

317
That's not right.

318
Ross, come on.

319
I mean...

320
...that woman made you miserable.

321
Okay, Ross?

322
Do you really want
to get back into that?

323
Okay, look. Yesterday...

324
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

325
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

326
...I have a near-death experience?

327
That's gotta mean something.

328
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

329
You weren't there.

330
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

331
Okay. You know what?

332
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

333
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

334
Okay? Look at today.

335
I mean, you escaped...

336
...death.

337
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

338
...getting back together with Emily.

339
That does make sense.

340
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

341
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

342
Well, there you go.

343
Yeah, maybe today's just...

344
...close-call day.

345
Hey, thanks, Rach.

346
Oh, honey. No problem.

347
Wait, wait. The message is blinking.

348
Maybe you didn't erase it.

349
Hey, Ross, it's you...

350
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

351
Hey, um, was Monica here?

352
Yeah.

353
I want my money back.

354
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

355
Hey, Pheebs?

356
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

357
Yes, once.

358
A little.

359
He kind of did it to himself.

360
It's not really a good story.

361
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

362
...but heavy fire.

363
Like if I was in a war.

364
Man, I would be great in a war.

365
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

366
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

367
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

368
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

369
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

370
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

371
You all know I'm a pacifist,
so I'm not interested in war in any way.

372
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

373
Not you, Joey.

﻿1
I'm gonna get more coffee,
do you want anything, baby doll?

2
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
See, I can't pull off "baby doll," can I?

4
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

5
- I'm gonna get some tea.
- Okay.

6
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
Nope.

8
- So it looks like it's going well for you two.
- I know. Really well.

9
In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

10
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think?

11
I think that it's great.
When are you gonna ask her?

12
- Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
- I swear. I promise. I promise.

13
My God, I'm so excited.

14
But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?

15
Because she cries when they die,
then there's the whole funeral.

16
- I'll see you after work, sweetie.
- Okay. Bye.

17
So, what movie should we see?

18
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him.

19
What? Really?

20
He told me at the counter.
He made me promise not to tell...

21
...but I couldn't hold it in any longer.

22
I can't believe this.

23
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

24
- Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
- Oh.

25
Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.

26
- No, but it is fast, isn't it?
- No.

27
- I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
- So, what are you gonna do?

28
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him.

29
Me? Why me?

30
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

31
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

32
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it would do...

33
...because I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

34
That is so sweet.

35
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it no problem.

36
Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island
really an island?

37
Uh-huh. That's why they call it
Staten "Island."

38
Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.

39
Also an island.

40
- Hey, what time is it?
- Two seventeen.

41
Wow, you realize we've been throwing
this ball without dropping it for an hour?

42
Are you serious?

43
Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't wanna say anything...

44
...because I didn't wanna jinx it.

45
Wow, we are pretty good at this.

46
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

47
I think that's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

48
I think my pants are a little loose.

49
Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?

50
- No.
- No.

51
Listen, um, I bought something.
I'm not sure she's gonna like it.

52
And it's gonna seem crazy...

53
...but this is something I've wanted
since I was a little girl.

54
You bought Shaun Cassidy.

55
No. I wish.

56
Okay, you ready?

57
Yeah.

58
Check it out.

59
- Oh, my God. What is it?
- What the hell is that?

60
- It's a cat.
- That is not a cat.

61
Yes, it is.

62
Why is it inside out?

63
Excuse me, but this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

64
How much did you pay for that?

65
Well, it was a little extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

66
- Yeah, how much?
- Thousand bucks.

67
On a cat?

68
It's not a cat.

69
All right. Listen, ball boys.

70
My grandmother had one of these
when I was little...

71
...and it was the sweetest thing.

72
I mean, it was so cute, it would sit
in my lap and just purr all day long...

73
...and I would drag a shoe string
on the ground and it would chase it.

74
Free cats do that too, you know.

75
It's not a cat.

76
Look, guys,
I'm really excited about this, okay?

77
I don't care what you think.

78
I'm gonna go set up a little litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

79
Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?

80
Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
or, uh...

81
...see how long we can throw this ball
back and forth?

82
- Uh, the ball thing.
- Yeah?

83
Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great
if we could go for like two straight hours...

84
...without dropping it?

85
Uh, yeah, it would.

86
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

87
- Uh-oh.
- What?

88
I have to pee.

89
And Rachel's in the bathroom.

90
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.

91
I know.

92
Don't switch hands, okay?

93
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

94
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?

95
- Gary, I am here to report a crime.
- Yeah?

96
It is a crime that you and I
don't spend time together.

97
Ha, ha. What's up?

98
Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking
about asking Phoebe to move in with you...

99
...and I thought maybe we should have
a talk, you know, man to... well, me.

100
Sure, okay.

101
Um, are you crazy?

102
Are you insane?

103
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be, you know, living together.

104
Yeah, I considered that.
I just know it'd make me happy.

105
- Heh. You mean scared.
- No, I mean happy.

106
Scared happy.

107
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to open your eyes, my man.

108
Don't you see? If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

109
You're gonna get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

110
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.

111
I know. I can't wait.

112
Were your parents happy or something?

113
Listen, Chandler, the way I see it...

114
...I was lucky enough to find someone
that I really love.

115
I just wanna be around her
as much as I can.

116
Wow, you know, when you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

117
- So you know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think I do.

118
You know what?

119
You move in with her.
You move in right with her right now.

120
- Maybe I should move in with Monica.
- No, it's too soon for you guys.

121
You're right about that.

122
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

123
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

124
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

125
How did it get there?

126
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

127
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

128
Joey, I left my watch
on the counter last night.

129
- It was here. Where is it?
- I don't know.

130
Well, come on, I'm late for work.

131
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

132
Guys, could you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and just help me find it?

133
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.

134
- What?
- Whatever you do, do not drop that ball.

135
- Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
- Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
Really?

137
I'm not gonna be able
to make it in to work today.

138
Um, I don't feel very good.

139
Yes!

140
Wow, uh, for a second there,
I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.

141
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

142
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

143
Wow, congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

144
- Rach.
- Yeah.

145
You have scratches all over you.
What happened?

146
- Well, it's my cat.
- What?

147
- Oh, yeah, I got a cat.
- I don't want a cat.

148
- Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
- Yeah.

149
You guys, this cat is nothing like
my grandmother's cat.

150
It's not sweet. It's not cute.

151
I even dragged a string on the ground...

152
...and it just flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

153
And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

154
...I know it's saying, "Rachel."

155
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

156
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me 300?

157
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.

158
Hey.

159
Did you talk to Gary
about the moving in thing?

160
- Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
- What?

161
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.
You are a very lucky lady.

162
You are useless.

163
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

164
...and you can't even do that right. God.

165
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

166
Oh!

167
Ooh, ooh, get out of here,
good-for-nothing.

168
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey, Gar.

169
Hey, sweetie.

170
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Okay.

171
- You look very pretty today.
- Thanks. Okay.

172
- Here's the thing.
- Yeah.

173
You know, I really want this relationship
to move forward.

174
Because if you're not moving forward,
you know, you're just moving backwards.

175
Now, that's not true. If you're not
moving forward, you're staying still.

176
And staying still is good. Watch this.

177
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

178
I want you to move in with me.

179
That is so sweet.

180
But don't you think
that it's a little it's too soon?

181
I mean, there's so much
we don't know about each other.

182
Oh.

183
Oh, okay. I get it.

184
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for, you know.

185
Uh-huh.

186
I really don't want
to mess up what we have.

187
I'm just worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

188
Yeah.

189
Which is why my answer is yes.

190
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

191
You're so happy.

192
Monica, stop throwing it so hard.

193
We're on the same team.

194
Four hours? You guys have been
doing this for four hours?

195
That's right, baby.

196
- All right. Let me in.
- No, no. Don't do it.

197
What?

198
He's a dropper.

199
Oh, yeah. That's right.

200
I'm not a dropper.

201
It's really a three-person game,
you know?

202
It's throwing and catching.

203
All right.

204
Oh, oh, it's so hard.

205
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

206
Oh, my... Oh, good God.

207
I give up, you guys. I don't know
what I'm gonna do with this thing.

208
Baking it didn't help, huh?

209
Why don't you just take it back
to where you got it?

210
I tried. They won't take her back.

211
Maybe that's because
she's a minion of the Antichrist.

212
Rach, why won't they take it back?

213
Well, they said they would,
but would only give me store credit.

214
What am I gonna do,
get a thousand regular cats?

215
If you want, you can keep it
until you find out what to do with it.

216
No, Mon, that's not the point.
I'm out a thousand dollars...

217
...I'm all scratched up...

218
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand.

219
Oh, my God.

220
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me.

221
My vision's been compromised.

222
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

223
It's okay. Man, that was close.

224
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

225
Hey.

226
- We have great news.
- We're moving in together. Isn't it great?

227
Yay!

228
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

229
- I know, I'm so excited.
- So am I.

230
Well, you're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.

231
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.

232
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in.

233
So you're moving in with him?
What happened?

234
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
But maybe it'll be all right.

235
I do really like him a lot...

236
...and probably do it eventually anyway.

237
And plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

238
Why, do you write him a lot?

239
No, I just heard
when people live together...

240
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

241
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

242
Oh! Oh.

243
I'm sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

244
Hey, honey.

245
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

246
No, nothing.

247
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

248
- Nothing at all?
- No.

249
As soon as something opens up,
we'll move in.

250
Unless it doesn't have a pool.
I need a pool.

251
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

252
Take a seat.

253
You okay? You feel all right?

254
Yeah, I feel great because
we're moving in together.

255
So you, uh...

256
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

257
You checked the Post?

258
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.

259
- Can I get some water?
- In a minute.

260
- You checked today's Post?
- Um, yeah, today's.

261
Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.

262
And, uh, these are the listings I found.

263
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

264
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights.

265
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

266
Let me tell you what I think
might be going on here.

267
No, no, don't look at the table.
Look at me.

268
Okay, I think somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

269
And I think someone said yes,
but now she's having doubts...

270
...because things are moving too fast
for someone.

271
Does that sound at all possible to you?

272
Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.

273
You want me to say it? I have doubts.

274
I'm sorry.

275
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

276
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.

277
I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of
things we don't know about each other.

278
I just figured everything I know about you,
I really like.

279
The things I don't know, I get to learn in a
place with both our names on the mailbox.

280
That's so sweet.

281
Sweetheart, but none of that matters
if it's too soon for you.

282
It's fine. We don't have to move in together.
I just want you to be happy.

283
- Living with you would make me happy.
- Phoebe, you don't have to say that.

284
No, I really wanna live with you.
I wanna move in with you.

285
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

286
Definitely, yes. Let's live in an apartment
that we both live in.

287
- Oh, that's great.
- Oh, wait, one sec. One sec.

288
Hey, you. Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

289
I've always wanted to say that every time
I was in one of these rooms...

290
...which was never.

291
Show cat. Quality show cat.

292
- Show cat.
- Oh, my God.

293
What's wrong with your baby?

294
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

295
- Ew, it's creepy looking.
- Oh, no.

296
No, it's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

297
- Yeah. Do you want it?
- Ha, ha. No, I hate cats.

298
Well, so then what are you doing to me?
Okay?

299
Just get out of here, all right? Move on.

300
- Jeez.
- Wow, what an unusual cat.

301
Yes, thank you. Exactly. You want it?

302
Maybe.

303
I was thinking about getting a cat.
I was just gonna go to the shelter, but...

304
- Okay. Why not?
- Oh, terrific. That'll be $2,000.

305
- Ha. What?
- Okay, a thousand.

306
I thought you wanted me
to adopt your cat?

307
Well, I do, but you're gonna have to look
at this as more of an investment than a cat.

308
Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.

309
Okay, okay, okay.

310
Obviously, you know how to haggle...

311
...so I'm not gonna try and
take you on, okay?

312
So $800, and I don't call the cops...

313
...which I should
because you are robbing me blind.

314
Blind. Just take the cat,
leave the money and run away.

315
Just run away. Damn it. Ugh.

316
Can't you at least smile or something?

317
Okay, did anybody just hear that?
Anybody?

318
- I'm starving.
- Come on, guys. Suck it up.

319
We're closing in on 10 hours.

320
It's gut-check time.

321
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

322
Please. I made this game what it is.

323
Not fun anymore?

324
I'm still hungry.

325
All right, there's some pizza at my place.

326
We can eat with one hand, right?
Are you with me?

327
- I am.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

328
Let's go, Team Monica.

329
All right, we can work out the name later.

330
Rachel, what is your cat doing
in one of my bowls?

331
It's not. I'm defrosting a chicken.

332
Oh, I sold, uh, Mrs. Whiskerson.

333
Oh, thank God.

334
- Did you get your money back?
- Yeah, $1500.

335
Wow, you made a profit?

336
- I just came for the red velvet pillow.
- Oh, yeah.

337
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rachel.

338
And, uh, don't forget,
you can come visit her any time you want.

339
Oh, good. Great. I'll keep that in mind.

340
Ahem, hey. So, what is this,
some kind of snake or something?

341
I really like waking up with you.

342
I like waking up with you too.

343
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

344
I could stay here all day.

345
That would be great.

346
- We could have breakfast in bed.
- Wait, just a second.

347
Oh!

348
Oh, no.

349
All right. Come on, Monica.
Look alive. Come on, look alive.

350
Oh, good. You're all up.

351
Phoebe, it's six o'clock in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

352
- Oh, yeah. That's over.
- What?

353
Come on, Gary's such a great guy.
Whatever the problem, you can work it out.

354
- He shot a bird.
- Oh, that is over.

355
- I'm sorry.
- That's terrible.

356
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be all right.

357
- Oh, hey, here, Pheebs.
- Oh. Nah, I don't feel like playing.

358
It's okay. It's okay.

359
Just pretend that it didn't happen, okay?
No one needs to know.

360
Phoebe's not an official ball player.

361
I mean, only official ball players
can drop the ball.

362
- Come on.
- Let's go.

363
Phoebe, honey,
you wanna get breakfast?

364
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay, let's race.

365
First one there wins. Ha, ha.

366
- You guys wanna eat here?
- Yeah.

367
Oh, man, that was great, huh?

368
Can you believe how long
we threw that ball around?

369
It is amazing it lasted that long.

370
I know. My arm is killing me.

371
No, I meant with the dropper over here.

372
You know, how did I get
this reputation as a dropper?

373
I am anything but a dropper.

374
Ross.

﻿1
What's going on?

2
Well, my eye is a little itchy.

3
Uh, mine too. Yeah.

4
Wow, it's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

5
Richard?
I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend.

6
Richard, that's all I ever hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
Since we've been going out,
I think I've mentioned his name twice.

8
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
It's not Richard, okay?
It's this new guy. He's really good.

10
I'm sorry. I'm not going to an eye doctor.

11
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- What?

12
Any time anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
Ross, come on.

15
All right, fine. I have a weird thing with
my eye. Can we not talk about it please?

16
All right.

17
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
Um, "Me, myself and eye."

18
Aah! Monica. Come on.

19
Does anyone wanna get some lunch?
All those in favor, say "eye."

20
Ross, stop it. Come on.

21
How much did I love
The King and "Eye."

22
- Chandler.
- Me too, me too.

23
Just stop it. That's enough. Come on.

24
- You okay there, man?
- Yeah. I got too excited.

25
All right, I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

26
- Oh, give him a kiss for me.
- All right. Bye.

27
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
Later.

29
I am so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

30
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

31
Wow, um...

32
Calm down?

33
I'm trying, but, man,
that guy can push my buttons.

34
Why are you so mad at him?

35
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it, okay?
- Well, it seems like...

36
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

37
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

38
Uh, no. What's it look like?

39
- Um, a piece of paper and it says "Ross."
- I see.

40
Hey.

41
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

42
I got the lead in a movie.

43
You got the lead in a movie?
What's the movie about?

44
Oh, it's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.

45
Yeah, um, I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day, right?

46
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

47
And when I get there, this old lady
answers the door. I say, "Where's Betsy?"

48
Right? And she says,
"Betsy's been dead 10 years."

49
Ooh. Chilling.

50
Oh, and the best part is we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

51
- You know what that means, buddy.
- Yeah, I know.

52
Road trip. Yeah, we can rent a car.
I just have to be there by Tuesday.

53
Oh, wait. My grandmother's dead.

54
Well, uh, we can talk about that too,
Pheebs.

55
No, no, her cab.

56
She probably won't be using it.
You could drive it to Las Vegas.

57
All right. Thanks, Pheebs.

58
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are we gonna do about my job?

59
- Oh, uh, not go.
- All right, great. Road trip, baby.

60
Is this okay with you?

61
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

62
- You can go.
- Thank you.

63
Hey, Rach, come on, you're gonna
be late for the eye doctor.

64
All right. Let's get this over with. Ugh.

65
Oh, no.

66
Look what I did.

67
I mean, look at this mess.

68
I mean, we're gonna probably
have to clean this up, you know?

69
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule.

70
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong.

71
All right, let's go, Blinky.

72
Chandler.

73
Oh, hey, Joey. What's up?

74
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

75
Hey, you've traveled a lot, right?

76
- Yeah, I've been around.
- Okay.

77
So which route should I take?
The northern route or the southern route?

78
Ooh, if you take the north route, there's
a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.

79
Great. Problem solved.

80
But on the southern route,
there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.

81
Well, back to square one.

82
Oh, I know a way that you can decide.

83
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions...

84
...and you answer as quickly as you can.

85
- Yes.
- Good. But wait.

86
Here we go. I want you to relax.

87
Take a deep breath.

88
Clear your mind.
Which do you like better...

89
...peanut butter or egg whites?
- Peanut butter.

90
- Rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
- Swimmer.

91
- Rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
- Monica. Oh.

92
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

93
- No thinking, no thinking. Tie or ascot?
- Ascot.

94
- North route or south route?
- North.

95
- Bam, there you go. Huh?
- Wow.

96
That was incredible.
Beard of bees here I come.

97
- Hey.
- Oh, this guy again.

98
Hey, what's up?

99
Uh, not much.
You guys wanna see a movie tonight?

100
- Sure. What do you wanna see?
- I don't know. Um...

101
I know how we can decide.
Phoebe, show him your game.

102
Um, no, thank you.

103
What's with her?

104
I don't know.
But I know how we can decide.

105
Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick, okay?

106
- What's better, action or comedy?
- Action.

107
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

108
Dude, you are sick.

109
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

110
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

111
- Uh, that's an eye removal machine.
- All right, I'm out of here.

112
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

113
Hi, Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

114
Monica told me you were a little nervous,
but everything's gonna be just fine.

115
- So we're done then.
- Almost, but first we gotta start.

116
- This is the glaucoma test. Sit down.
- Uh-huh.

117
- Okay.
- Put your chin here.

118
Mm-hm.

119
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

120
Uh, a what?

121
A small puff of air. Now, come on.

122
- Here we go.
- All right.

123
One, two, three.

124
Okay.

125
I'm sorry. All right.

126
Ha, ha, I'm gonna stay in here this time.
Okay.

127
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

128
- One, two...
- I'm sorry.

129
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

130
- That's okay.
- Okay.

131
Okay.

132
- One...
- Uh-huh.

133
...two...
- Oh! I'm sorry.

134
You know what? You're young.
You probably don't have glaucoma.

135
I'm okay.

136
Okay, so it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

137
- Ow! Hey, what are you...? Are you crazy?
- Okay.

138
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

139
I want you to take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

140
No, I don't put things in my eye.

141
Okay then. I guess we'll see you
back here in three months.

142
- Great.
- And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

143
Okay, just give me the damn drops.

144
Dr. Miller?

145
P-E-C-F-D.

146
Very good, Monica.

147
- You know where they are.
- I sure do.

148
And you don't get one.

149
You know, I gotta tell you,
those eye drops are a miracle.

150
My eye is 100 percent better.

151
- They're still in my coat.
- Damn.

152
- Hey.
- Hey, you ready to go?

153
Listen, how cold is it gonna be there?

154
Do I need a coat or will all these
sweater vests be enough?

155
- What?
- I love you.

156
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'm gonna miss him.

157
Thanks a lot. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

158
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the
movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

159
Uh, no, not really.
It's an independent film.

160
So we don't have a real big budget.
I figured I'd just stay in your room.

161
I see, but once you get your first paycheck,
you'll be springing for a suite.

162
Lead in the movie,
they must be paying you a lot.

163
Oh, yeah. Check this out.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...

164
...one penny of it
goes right in Joey's pocket.

165
So you don't get paid
unless the movie makes money?

166
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?

167
"She's been dead for 10 years."

168
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

169
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
I just wanted to say goodbye
to you guys.

171
And to see if maybe you guys
will place a little bet for me.

172
Twenty bucks on black 15.

173
- You got it.
- All right.

174
- All right. Bye-bye, now.
- Bye, you guys.

175
- I'm gonna say goodbye at the car.
- Okay.

176
Anybody wanna say
goodbye to me at the car?

177
Oh, honey, I'll say goodbye to you
at the car if you don't mind the pus.

178
See you.

179
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

180
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?

181
Pheebs?

182
Hello?

183
Phoebe?

184
Come on.

185
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

186
Pheebs, are you mad at me
or something?

187
Because if you are,
please tell me what it is I did.

188
- Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
- Well, I don't know.

189
Well, I can't help you.

190
Okay, well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

191
Apology accepted.

192
Okay.

193
- So we're good?
- Uh-huh.

194
All right.

195
I'll, uh, see you later, okay?

196
- Bye, fat ass.
- All right.

197
Phoebe, come on, will you please tell me
what it is that made you so mad at me?

198
I don't know. I don't remember.

199
Well, if you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

200
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

201
But I am sorry about the "fat ass" thing...

202
...because you actually have
a very sweet little heinie.

203
Man, I'm getting pretty tired.
You might have to take over soon.

204
We've been driving for a half-hour.
And you haven't looked at the road once.

205
Don't worry. It's out there.

206
- Maybe I just need lunch.
- Yeah.

207
You wanna eat? My treat.

208
Isn't that Ross' money?

209
Yeah, okay.

210
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

211
- I don't know.
- Oh, hey, I know how we can decide.

212
All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you
questions...

213
...and then you have to answer
real fast, okay?

214
So, uh, clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

215
Okay.

216
- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
- Too dry.

217
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- No.

218
- Is this movie gonna be my big break?
- No.

219
- What?
- Yes.

220
- Dude, you said no.
- I also said yes.

221
You don't think this is gonna be
a big break for me?

222
No.

223
I don't believe this.

224
Look, Joe, I just don't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

225
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie.

226
They're not even paying you.
This doesn't even sound like a real movie.

227
You know, I don't know why
you're dumping all over my big break.

228
Because, Joe, I don't think
this is going to be your big break.

229
Is that why you're on this trip? Huh?
To make me feel like a loser?

230
- Because if it is, I'd rather be alone.
- You don't want me on the trip?

231
Not if you're like this.

232
Tell you what, the next time
you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.

233
Yeah, I don't want you on the trip.

234
All right, fine.
Why don't you pull over? I'll get out now.

235
Fine.

236
Get out.

237
You're not supposed to stop
on a bridge.

238
- Get out.
- Fine.

239
Wait. Wait. There's no sidewalk.

240
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

241
Okay, are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

242
No.

243
Are you angry with me because I said
your handwriting is childlike?

244
No, that made me feel precious.

245
Oh, I know. Is it because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

246
You know, "whom, whom."
Sometimes it's "who."

247
Yeah? Sometimes it's...

248
Oh, did you beat him at a board game?

249
He turns into such a baby
when he starts to lose.

250
- Okay, I'm the baby.
- Hey. Stop it.

251
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

252
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

253
- Why?
- I don't know. He went crazy.

254
We were playing that game where you
ask a question and have to answer fast.

255
Oh, that game should not be played
without my supervision.

256
Well, I don't know what made him mad.

257
All I said was that, uh, I didn't think
this was gonna be his big break...

258
...that this movie wasn't gonna
do anything for him...

259
...and that it didn't sound
like a real movie.

260
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

261
What's in the bag?

262
Oh, I figured you guys
would all be mad at me...

263
...so I got you some gifts
that I found on the side of the road.

264
- Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
- I do.

265
Okay.

266
- Not even close.
- Okay, well, help me. I can't do this.

267
All right, come on. Let's do it.

268
- All right.
- Sit down.

269
- All right, put your head back. All right.
- Yes. Okay.

270
- Now, open your eyes.
- Okay, they are.

271
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Four.

272
Oh, my God, I was thinking four.

273
- Really?
- Yes.

274
All right, why don't we start
with a practice one, okay?

275
- No drops.
- Great.

276
On three. One, two, three.

277
My pillow's all wet.

278
Well, you said it was practice.

279
- Then why did you move?
- Because I knew you were lying.

280
- All right. Come here. Come on.
- What are you doing? Monica.

281
Stop it! Oh, my God, stop it.

282
I am going...

283
- Turn it over.
- Aah!

284
I am going to get...

285
Get these drops in your eye.

286
Oh, my God.
You really are freakishly strong.

287
Aah! Aah! Monica, stop it!

288
Damn, it's empty.

289
Wow. If Joey and Chandler walked in
right now, we could make a fortune.

290
Ooh, that is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

291
Or Rachel.

292
Hello? It's Joey.

293
I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me
what happened. He's really upset.

294
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he
finds out what I did with his sweater vests.

295
What did you do to his sweater vests?

296
Let's just say there's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

297
Monica, listen, is Phoebe there?
I gotta ask her something about the car.

298
Yeah, hold on one second.

299
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, Pheebs.

300
Listen, this wooden box
keeps sliding out from under the seat.

301
- What is it?
- Oh, that's my grandma.

302
And thanks, Joey.
She's having a really great time.

303
Is that Joey? Is that Joey?
Let me talk to him.

304
Joey, Chandler's here.
He was wondering if...

305
Okay, I guess he ran out of change.

306
He won't even talk to me.

307
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

308
Maybe you should send him something.

309
So when he gets to Las Vegas,
he'll know that you're sorry.

310
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

311
Oh, no, don't say I'm sorry with porn.

312
You know what you should send him?
A carton of cigarettes.

313
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

314
No. That's prison.

315
Okay, Pheebs.

316
I know how we're gonna figure this out.

317
Okay. Clear your mind...

318
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head. Okay?

319
Mm-hm.

320
- What's better, flora or fauna?
- Fauna.

321
- Simon or Garfunkel?
- Garfunkel.

322
- Why are you mad at me?
- You said I was boring. Oh.

323
When did I say you were boring?

324
Oh, my God, I remember now.
We were playing chess.

325
Phoebe, you and I
have never played chess.

326
Oh, come on. Yes.

327
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

328
And then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

329
Okay, there's a chance
this may have been a dream.

330
Hey. Stanley. Hey.

331
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

332
Um, slight change of plans.
We've shut down.

333
What? Why?

334
It's a money thing. We don't have any.

335
- Ha, ha. You're kidding, right?
- No.

336
- What?
- It's probably just temporary.

337
We're hoping to get more money soon,
so if you could just, uh, hang out.

338
Hang out? How long?

339
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money'll turn up.

340
People always wanna invest in movies.
Hey, you're not rich, are you?

341
- No.
- Worth a shot.

342
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

343
- Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
- Yeah.

344
These got left for you.

345
Thanks.

346
"Congratulations on your big break."

347
Hello?

348
- Monica, it's Joey.
- Hey, Joey.

349
Aw, you remember me
even though you're a big star.

350
Aw, come on.
It'll be years before I forget you.

351
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?

352
Do you have a dressing room?
Do you have a chair with your name on it?

353
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

354
Listen, uh, make sure you tell Chandler
he couldn't have been more wrong.

355
Uh-oh, I gotta go, Monica.
My, uh, sushi's here.

356
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting. Okay.

357
Everybody smile.

358
Okay.

359
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay at Caesar's.
We hope it's toga-rific.

360
Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now.

361
- Hey, Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
- Yeah.

362
- Go!
- Aah!

363
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!

364
- Hold it open. Okay.
- Aah!

365
We'll see you in about
three or four hours.

﻿1
Hello?

2
- Hey, Joey!
- Hey, Pheebs.

3
Can you do me a favor?

4
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

5
Sure. Where is it?

6
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

7
Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?

8
That's it! Thanks.

9
- Wanna talk to Chandler?
- Let me talk to him.

10
He didn't believe in my movie...

11
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

12
I've tried to apologize.

13
If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go and do it in person.

14
I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?

15
Yeah.

16
- Hey.
- Don't come out here.

17
I support you 100 percent
and I wanna prove that to you in person.

18
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.

19
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

20
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

21
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

22
Uh, what was that?

23
Uh, Entertainment Tonight.

24
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

25
Monica?

26
I'm sorry I'm late.

27
Monica?

28
Phoebe?

29
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

30
That's okay.

31
What the hell took you so long?

32
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.

33
- Which Richard?
- The Richard.

34
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

35
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

36
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?

37
It was really nice. We talked
and I had lunch with him.

38
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

39
- Really?
- Again, Richard Simmons.

40
Go on.

41
The strange part was
he was really nice...

42
...and he looks great,
but I didn't feel anything.

43
So why can't we tell Chandler?

44
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

45
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

46
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.

47
What?

48
On a totally different bet.

49
Hey!

50
- It's almost our anniversary!
- I know.

51
One year ago today, I was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

52
Aw, now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

53
- Huh.
- I got you a gift.

54
- It's not till tomorrow.
- I know, but you have to open it today.

55
Okay! There you go!

56
- It's two tickets to Vegas!
- Wow.

57
Yeah! For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.

58
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

59
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."

60
We have to?

61
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

62
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

63
Plus, we get to have
our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

64
"Anna-vada-versary!"

65
I think we should see other people.

66
We can go, right?

67
Great idea.

68
I'm gonna go too!

69
Pheebs, it's kind of
our anniversary.

70
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

71
Ditch you?
You were pregnant...

72
Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.

73
- Hi.
- Hey.

74
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

75
Including me!

76
Do you wanna go?

77
I can take a couple days off work.

78
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

79
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.

80
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.

81
- Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
- Sounds great.

82
I'll call the airlines.

83
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

84
To walk around naked.

85
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

86
Naked alone time.

87
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
I wanna walk around naked.

88
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

89
Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

90
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

91
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Pheebs.

92
What about after I give you
these candies?

93
- I guess it's a little better now.
- Ha, ha.

94
Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.

95
I'll be back.

96
Happy Plane-a-versary.

97
Aw. I love you.

98
- Can I give you your present now?
- Okay!

99
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

100
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

101
How about "I did forget the present,
forgive me" not fake-out?

102
You can give it to me
when we get back.

103
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

104
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

105
What "Richard thing"?

106
Oh, no.

107
What "Richard thing"?

108
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

109
I ran into Richard yesterday.

110
He asked me if I wanted to go
for a bite and I did.

111
I didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

112
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

113
I'm not mad.

114
Really?

115
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."

116
No big deal.

117
Great.

118
Okay, London, 1.

119
Ooh.

120
Hmm.

121
Oh, look what happened.

122
Huh, check me out.

123
I'm in my kitchen...

124
...naked.

125
I'm picking up an orange.

126
I'm naked.

127
I'm lighting the candles.

128
Naked. And carefully.

129
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!

130
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.

131
Okay, vivid colors,
expressive brush strokes.

132
Unless she wants me
to be looking at that.

133
She knows I'm home.

134
She knows I can see her.

135
What kind of game is she playing?

136
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.

137
Oh, Dr. Geller.

138
Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.

139
Or am I?

140
Love to love you baby

141
Ow

142
Love to love you baby
Ow

143
Love to love you baby
Ow

144
Darn it!

145
Hey.

146
May I come in?

147
Uh, yeah, if you want to.

148
Do you want me to?

149
Yeah, sure?

150
So do I.

151
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

152
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

153
This is just about tonight.

154
I won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of "us."

155
I just want this to be...

156
...about what it is.

157
And, um...

158
...what is that, Ross?

159
The physical act of love.

160
What, are you crazy?

161
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

162
Oh, God. You saw me?

163
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

164
No!

165
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

166
No!

167
No.

168
No, no, no, no.

169
Hey, you guys, wait! You guys.

170
This place is much better than London.

171
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

172
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner. Huh.

173
You don't eat animals.

174
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

175
I can totally settle down here.

176
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!

177
Look! Hey!

178
Oh, my God.

179
Hey, Joey!

180
- Wow!
- Hi.

181
Love your condoms, my man.

182
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

183
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

184
Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.

185
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

186
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.

187
Who are you talking to?

188
The director.

189
Uh, her.

190
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.

191
Why? What happened?

192
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

193
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

194
- I'm so sorry.
- Such a drag.

195
Sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry.

196
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

197
- I knew you weren't okay with that.
- So you're a gladiator!

198
What's going on?

199
- Monica had lunch with Richard.
- Dawson?

200
No...

201
But that would've been so cool!

202
Her boyfriend Richard.

203
It meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

204
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

205
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

206
Thanks.

207
- Aw, there we go.
- Now I love Vegas.

208
I promise you next time
I absolutely will tell you.

209
"Next time"?

210
Ooh, so close.

211
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

212
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

213
That's funny, I think I just did.

214
If you act like this,
I won't be around you.

215
- Fine.
- Happy anniversary!

216
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

217
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

218
- No, it's not.
- What're you talking about?

219
Don't look at me. I just work here.

220
Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

221
Now, I'm just letting you know...

222
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

223
Yep, that's hilarious.

224
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

225
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

226
No, not really.

227
But you know,
I just don't embarrass that easily.

228
What? You totally get embarrassed.

229
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.

230
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

231
Hey, lady!

232
I don't care how much
you want it, okay?

233
I am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

234
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

235
Really?

236
Yeah, sure, sure.

237
They would scrub the floors.

238
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

239
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

240
So they would stick it right...

241
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.

242
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.

243
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

244
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

245
Can you believe that?

246
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

247
Build up my upper body...

248
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

249
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?

250
I'll take this $100,
turn it into $5000...

251
...and I'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

252
Good luck.

253
- I don't need luck. I've thought this through.
- I see.

254
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

255
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

256
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

257
Big deal. It's only Chandler.

258
I am so sorry.

259
This is crazy having
such a stupid argument.

260
I don't wanna see Richard.

261
So go fix it.

262
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

263
Tell him sorry and you love him.

264
You're right, Phoebe.

265
- Thank you.
- Sure.

266
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

267
- Anybody lose this?
- Coming out.

268
Place your bet.

269
Dice her out.

270
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

271
Hmm.

272
So, uh, I'm on my way
back to the bathroom.

273
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

274
What are you... I am sorry, sir.

275
I think he just really likes you.

276
Hey...

277
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

278
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

279
Do you have any extra pants? Uh, my friend
seems to have had a little accident.

280
- Can I change 100?
- Changing 100.

281
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.

282
That's right.

283
- Thirteen.
- Hit me!

284
Oh, man!

285
Wait!

286
You are not gonna believe this!

287
I have found my identical hand twin.

288
What?

289
My identical hand twin!

290
What's an identical hand twin?

291
It was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

292
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

293
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

294
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.

295
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

296
How?

297
I don't have it all worked out yet.

298
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

299
Again, I must go back to...

300
...how?

301
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

302
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

303
...twice? Huh?

304
I can't really put a price on that.

305
Are you un-supporting me again?

306
No. No.

307
I support you 100 percent.
I just didn't get it right away.

308
Now I'm caught up.

309
Identical hand twins.

310
It's a million-dollar idea!

311
- Hey!
- Pheebs!

312
I found my identical hand twin!

313
Oh, you're so lucky!

314
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

315
- No.
- But she just came up here.

316
That was Joey.

317
I wonder where she is? It's so weird.

318
She's probably talking to Richard.

319
Would you stop that?

320
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

321
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

322
- Really?
- Yes.

323
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

324
Okay.

325
Good.

326
I should really start wearing hats.

327
Welcome to Las Vegas.

328
- Did you enjoy your flight?
- I did.

329
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.

330
- I hope you had a nice flight.
- Oh, it was the best.

﻿1
Previously on Friends:

2
Don't come out here.

3
- I ran into Richard.
- Which Richard?

4
My ex-boyfriend.

5
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

6
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

7
Oh, no.

8
- You can't see him.
- You can't tell me what to do.

9
That's funny, I think I just did.

10
- I have found my identical hand twin.
- What's that?

11
A guy with my identical hands.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

12
You thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

13
No.

14
Last night was embarrassing
for you too.

15
I just don't embarrass that easily.

16
- I think the check-in is that way.
- Ah.

17
Hello.

18
Ah, kids love me.

19
Hey! Hi. You guys are here!

20
Yay! What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

21
Let me guess. Um, Pancho Villa.

22
And you're Bob Saget.

23
Pancho Villa?

24
What are you talking about, Pheebs?
I don't...

25
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

26
Hey, you wet my pants!

27
Whoa, what kind of party was this?

28
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

29
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

30
- Oh!
- What?

31
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.

32
Oh. I bet she's one of those people.

33
Mole people?

34
What? No, a lurker.

35
Oh. What's that?

36
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

37
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then...

38
Kills you?

39
No, they swoop in and steal your jackpot.

40
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

41
- How do you know about this?
- My nana used to do it.

42
That's how she paid for my dance...
Karate lessons.

43
Dance karate?

44
Yes, it's a deadly...

45
...but beautiful sport.

46
- It won't come off.
- What?

47
It won't come off.

48
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

49
I took it off,
and then I drew it back on.

50
Hey! You made it!

51
Who's your friend? He's hot.

52
Thanks, man.

53
Listen, I talked to Chandler,
and I'm sorry about the movie.

54
Don't be sorry.

55
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.

56
Your what?

57
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

58
This is a gold mine.

59
What?

60
That won't make you any money.

61
Well, fine.

62
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

63
Except, uh, you.
You can live in the thumb.

64
All right, baby, come on!

65
Yes! Yes!

66
- I am on fire!
- See you later.

67
What are you doing?

68
What's it look like? Going home.

69
Why?

70
Chandler.

71
Chandler, wait.

72
Sorry, I was just playing
for one second.

73
If you don't want me to see
Richard again, I won't.

74
He means nothing to me.

75
Oh, come on. I was there.

76
I know he's the love of your life.

77
Not anymore.

78
Really?

79
Really.

80
All right?

81
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

82
Okay, this is empty.

83
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.

84
Where's the other guy?

85
Which guy?

86
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

87
I don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

88
Okay.

89
- How you doing?
- Very busy.

90
Right. Okay.

91
Yes, hello. I have a question.

92
Um, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

93
A beard and a mustache.

94
Thank you.

95
No, she didn't think so.

96
I know. It's like... Anyway...

97
Makeup didn't cover it. We've tried
everything, and nothing's worked.

98
What do we do?

99
Yeah. Uh-huh.

100
Yeah. Oh, okay.

101
Okay, thank you.

102
Yeah, it's not coming off.

103
What? What else did he say?

104
Um, he said he thought I was funny.

105
Okay, look. Let's just go downstairs...

106
...we'll have some fun,
and you will forget all about it.

107
There's no way I am leaving
looking like this!

108
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

109
Ross, I am a human doodle!

110
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

111
Besides, no one will even look at you.

112
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

113
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

114
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

115
There was some staring and pointing.

116
I need a drink.

117
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

118
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

119
That is one big drink.

120
Macadamia nut?

121
Um, wow! That's some pricey nut.

122
Really like those macadamia nuts, huh?

123
Nope.

124
Get out of here, you lurker!

125
Go on, get!

126
- Hey, Pheebs.
- You made up.

127
I couldn't be mad at him for too long.

128
She couldn't live
without the "Chand love."

129
Aw.

130
Get a room.

131
- We have one.
- I know. Use it.

132
Oh, yeah.

133
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

134
- Excuse me?
- It's me. Joey.

135
Do I know you?

136
Joey?

137
Oh, yeah.

138
Yeah, the hand guy.

139
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

140
Nothing.

141
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

142
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

143
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

144
- I have to get back to work.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

145
We can have our own show.

146
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

147
Huh?

148
And I wrote a song for us.

149
This hand is your hand

150
This hand is my hand

151
Oh, wait, that's your hand

152
No, wait, it's my hand

153
- That's okay.
- But you haven't even heard the chorus!

154
Oh, my God.

155
I look like my great-aunt, Muriel.

156
All right, you know what?

157
We don't have to go downstairs.

158
We can bring Vegas up to us.

159
All right, come on.

160
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

161
- Thirteen.
- Hit me.

162
Ooh, 23.

163
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

164
You win $10!

165
- I bet 20.
- Right.

166
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

167
Yes!

168
I've never seen a roll like this!

169
That's right, baby!

170
What do I want now?

171
Eight? Uh, six.

172
Pick a number!
That is your only job.

173
- Eight.
- Thank you.

174
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

175
- Eight it is.
- Yes!

176
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

177
- No.
- Okay, good.

178
- What do I want now?
- Try a hard eight.

179
- What?
- Two fours.

180
Eight!

181
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

182
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

183
You get this, and, uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place.

184
We get the biggest suite in the place.

185
The biggest suite in the place!

186
Come on!

187
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.

188
Because I had lunch with Rich...

189
Me neither!

190
- What now?
- Uh, another hard eight.

191
Hard eight? Let's call it easy eight!

192
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

193
...and we get married here, tonight.

194
Shut up!

195
It just got interesting!

196
What did you say?

197
You roll another eight,
we get married tonight.

198
- You serious?
- Yes. I love you.

199
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

200
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

201
What do you say?

202
- Okay.
- Okay.

203
Hard eight.

204
That's a four.
And where's the other one?

205
- Under the table.
- Nobody move!

206
You look that way, I look this way.

207
Here it is, here it is.

208
That could be 4 or 5.

209
It's your call.

210
It's a four.

211
I think so too.

212
Oh, well, lost again.

213
That's it. You and me. Outside!

214
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!

215
Oh!

216
Be cool.

217
Okay, your lurking days are over.

218
- What?
- Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.

219
You move on,
I'll be one step ahead of you...

220
...every single time.

221
And then I'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

222
...till Monday...

223
...because that's when I go home.

224
- When do you leave?
- Also Monday.

225
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

226
Hit me.

227
Hit me.

228
We need more cards.

229
Yeah, and we also need more, um, drinks.
Hold on a second.

230
Hello, Vegas?

231
We would like more alcohol.

232
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

233
Oh, I forgot to dial.

234
That must be our alcohol and beers.

235
- Hey.
- It's Joey! I love Joey!

236
Oh, I love Joey!

237
Joey lives with a duck.

238
Look, I need some help, okay?

239
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

240
I'll do it. Whatever you need
me to do, I'm your man.

241
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

242
Are you okay?

243
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

244
Hey, Rach?

245
How you doing?

246
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

247
Don't let her drink anymore.

248
Here's that macadamia nut.

249
- No, something else.
- Oops.

250
So, what do you wanna do now?

251
I wanna get out of the room.

252
I really miss downstairs.

253
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.

254
Well, hello!

255
I'm Ross.

256
- Good luck to you.
- Sir, you've got a little something...

257
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
I won! I won! I finally won!

259
I won! That was my quarter!

260
Take a hike, toots.

261
Excuse me, sir.

262
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

263
Is that true, miss?

264
- Sells drugs to kids.
- What?

265
She sells drugs to kids.

266
It was my quarter.

267
Was it her quarter?

268
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

269
- Okay, lady, you're out of here.
- No, you can't arrest me!

270
I won't go back to that hellhole!

271
I'm just taking you outside.

272
Oh, okay.

273
I need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

274
Here's something blue and new.

275
You are so efficient. I love you.

276
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

277
We need something old.

278
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

279
That'll work.

280
I don't think so.

281
Now something borrowed.

282
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

283
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

284
Aw.

285
Okay. One thing at a time.

286
- Are you gonna play?
- No, I don't really have any money.

287
Not yet, anyway.

288
Can't sit here if you don't play.

289
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange.

290
I'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

291
Would you like to see my card?

292
What did I do with my Filofax?

293
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

294
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

295
Oh, my God. May I just say that you
gentlemen have the exact same hands?

296
They're identical.

297
I've never seen that
in the business world.

298
Stop it.

299
Miss Phalange, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

300
Please stop it.

301
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

302
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

303
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

304
Didn't I just throw you out?

305
No, you threw out Phoebe.

306
I'm Regina Phalange. Phalange.

307
Come on, lady.

308
Please take him too.

309
Me? Oh, come on, man.

310
Come on, buddy.

311
Don't let him do this. Come on!

312
I'm your hand twin!

313
Hello. One marriage, please.

314
We want to get married.

315
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

316
All right.

317
What are you doing?

318
The "Wedding March."
Does that freak you out?

319
No, it's the graduation song.

320
Okay.

321
This is it. We're gonna get married.

322
You sure you wanna do this?

323
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

324
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!

325
Wait. Okay.

﻿1
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay
and I have babies coming out.

3
Okay.
Have you started having contractions?

4
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

5
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

6
Which of you is the father?

7
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

8
Okay.

9
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

10
Pheebs...

11
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

12
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

13
Okay. Um...

14
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

15
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me.

16
What took you so long?

17
Your cab left when ours did.

18
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

19
You're not wearing one.

20
Oh, man! I did it again!

21
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

22
My mom might...
What are you doing?

23
I've got to get the before shot.

24
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

25
...is because, uh, she's not coming.

26
- What?
- She hit her head in the shower.

27
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

28
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

29
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina.

30
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

31
He's head of the department.

32
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.

33
I'm having my first contraction.

34
- Oh, it's not bad.
- Okay.

35
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

36
You okay?

37
Something hurts.

38
Ooh, it's sympathy pains.
Oh, that's so sweet.

39
I didn't know I cared that much.

40
- Hello.
- Hi.

41
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

42
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

43
I'll be back to do your internal.

44
Just relax, everything looks great.

45
And also, I love Fonzie.

46
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

47
That's what it sounded like.

48
All right.

49
Hey!

50
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

51
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

52
Uh, Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

53
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

54
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

55
...you get two percent financing.

56
Yeah.

57
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

58
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

59
Oh, my.

60
They're male nurses.

61
Heh, heh. Not in my head.

62
They want to take us out Saturday night.
What do you say?

63
Um...

64
- I don't think so.
- What?

65
What are you talking about?

66
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

67
I'm moving on and so are you.

68
Why don't you want to go?

69
Um...

70
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

71
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

72
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

73
You're coming.
And when they get off...

74
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

75
Yep. There's always room for Jello.

76
How do you make that dirty?

77
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

78
Grandma's chicken salad...

79
Ross!

80
Get a shot of this.

81
Hey, babies, these are the headlines
when you were born.

82
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

83
...check it out.

84
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

85
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

86
Okay, I'm having another one.

87
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Ooh, yes, it does! Ow.

88
Ow, ow, ow!

89
Ooh.

90
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.

91
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

92
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Maybe they're with them.

93
Really? Male nurses?

94
Yeah, I was bummed too.

95
So they're going on dates?

96
- When?
- I think Saturday.

97
- What's with him?
- Um, sympathy pains.

98
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

99
Okay.

100
Let's see what we got here.

101
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

102
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

103
...is that another doctor?

104
Oh, no, no.

105
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

106
The Fonz.

107
All right.

108
Soon.

109
It's not that weird, is it?

110
It's very weird.

111
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

112
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

113
What are you doing?

114
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

115
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

116
- Again, it's not...
- Aah! Aah!

117
Hey, there you are.

118
Um, there's something you should know.

119
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

120
I am so fine.
You and I, we're just, nothing.

121
Just goofing around.

122
Um, I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

123
But, um, if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

124
Fine. Maybe I will too.

125
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

126
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!

127
Okay, Pheebs?

128
This is Dr. Oberman.

129
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

130
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

131
You're going into what grade?

132
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

133
Uh-huh. Me too.

134
Ross, I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

135
Really, I'm fully qualified...

136
Shh, Doogie. Shh.

137
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?

138
Go, little boy! Go!

139
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

140
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

141
Uh, well, what else could it be?

142
It's kidney stones.

143
Or...

144
Kidney stones.

145
You're getting there.

146
These babies are very, very lucky.

147
They are? Why?

148
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

149
Happy birthday.

150
Just to clarify.

151
I'm not Fonzie.

152
Yeah.

153
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

154
- I know, it is.
- Yeah.

155
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

156
I want to keep one.

157
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

158
You've gotta be kidding.

159
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

160
Maybe I can. You don't know.

161
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

162
Maybe not. You know?

163
Three babies are a handful.

164
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

165
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

166
Phoebe, no. This is insane.

167
Just ask him.

168
What? Me?

169
I can't ask him!

170
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

171
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.

172
Just feel him out.

173
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

174
You're right.

175
Tell him it's for you.

176
Feeling better, sweetie?

177
Maybe a little.

178
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

179
Me too.

180
Hey. I just heard. What's up?

181
Kidney stones.

182
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

183
But they're too close to the bladder.

184
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra...

185
Whoa!

186
No, no, no.
Nothing is going "up," okay?

187
"Up" is not an option.
What's a urethra?

188
Are you crazy?

189
Did you ask him?

190
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

191
I'm kind of on a clock here.

192
Oh, Fonzie.

193
You know who I always liked? Mork.

194
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.

195
Fonzie met Mork.

196
Mork froze Fonzie.

197
Yeah...

198
Yes...

199
...but Fonzie was already cool.

200
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

201
Yeah, that's right.

202
How you doing?

203
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

204
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

205
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

206
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of the last favor you asked me to do.

207
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi!

208
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're going out with on Saturday.

209
Dan, Monica.

210
Nice to meet you.

211
Hello, Dan.

212
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really! Really!

213
So Dan...

214
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

215
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

216
- Chandler.
- That's okay.

217
I'm doing this to
get through medical school.

218
Oh.

219
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

220
Sure.

221
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

222
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

223
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

224
Aw, great.

225
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

226
- No.
- All right, very good!

227
This is a big one.

228
Unh! Get these things out of me!

229
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

230
I want the drugs, Ross!

231
I do too! I do too!

232
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye.

233
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

235
She should be here.

236
She'll make it on time.

237
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

238
So Frank...

239
Three babies.
Whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?

240
Not to me.

241
Fair enough.

242
You're at 10 centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

243
I want only the father here.

244
- We love you.
- Good luck.

245
- Bye, Dan!
- Uh, bye, Monica.

246
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

247
What is that?

248
Oh, my God!

249
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

250
Ready? Time to try pushing.

251
Ready? Time to try peeing.

252
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

253
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

254
I see the head.

255
Yes, it is a head!

256
Keep pushing. Come on.

257
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

258
There's somebody coming out of you!

259
It's my son!

260
All right.

261
Here's your first baby.

262
Yes!

263
Yes! We got a baby boy!

264
Frank Junior, Junior!

265
How does he look?

266
So gross!

267
Okay. You ready to push again?

268
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

269
Come on, you can do it.
You can do it.

270
Yeah!

271
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

272
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

273
How scary is that?

274
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

275
He's coming! Yes, he's coming!

276
Hey, where's his thing?

277
Chandler's a girl!

278
Oh, God. Kindergarten flashback.

279
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

280
But Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!

281
Okay, keep saying it.

282
- Am I too late?
- No, no. Everything's okay.

283
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

284
We have our babies?

285
Yeah.

286
We have our babies.

287
Oh, my God.

288
You did it, man.

289
Would you like to see them?

290
They're so small.

291
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Great.

292
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

293
You and I are just "goofing around."

294
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

295
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

296
Well, I have...

297
...and the technical definition is:

298
"Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

299
...and have amazing sex...

300
...and just want to spend
more time together."

301
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

302
...then we have to get you
my original dictionary.

303
I am so bad at this.

304
- You're better than you think you are.
- Really?

305
Okay. So if...

306
- Know when to stop.
- I sensed that I should stop.

307
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

308
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not going to happen.

309
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

310
You're my favorite.

311
- Which one do you have?
- I don't care.

312
Hi.

313
Hey.

314
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

315
Did you talk to them
about, you know...

316
Yeah, um...

317
No, honey.

318
Oh, okay.

319
It was a long shot.

320
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

321
Yeah.

322
So here you are.

323
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

324
Everyone said labor
was the hardest thing.

325
But they were wrong. This is.

326
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.

327
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

328
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.

329
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

330
Okay, so we're cool.

331
We're going to be great.

332
Little high-fives.

333
Aah, aah, aah.

334
Well, if you're going to cry...

335
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

336
I know.

337
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

338
You won't be able to take it.

339
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

340
They'll call her Chandler.

341
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

342
It works on you.

﻿1
Come in.

2
I've been waiting for you.

3
Hi, I just...

4
Ah! Oh, my God! Monica!

5
Oh, my God!

6
I'm sorry! I was...

7
I was taking a nap.

8
Since when do you
take naps in that position?

9
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.

10
Yes, I was. A guy.

11
From work.

12
I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!

13
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant.

14
The one that looks like
a non-threatening Ray Liotta?

15
Aha. That one!

16
Give me a second. I'll be out of your hair.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.

17
When I get back,
I want every little detail.

18
Maybe that's him.

19
Okay, um... Okay, um...

20
It's just Joey and Ross.

21
Why aren't you at the movie?

22
We were, but Ross was talking
so loud on his phone, they threw us out.

23
I had to talk loud
because the movie was loud!

24
- He's talking to London.
- Did he get in touch with Emily?

25
No. He's calling everyone
on her side of the family...

26
...hoping someone
will help him get in touch with her.

27
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!

28
Ross.

29
Way to suck up to the family!

30
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!

31
- Hey
- Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!

32
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.

33
Vomit tux?

34
Who vomited on...

35
You know what? What you up to, Joe?

36
They're doing
this telethon thing on TV.

37
And my agent got me a job as co-host!

38
That's great!

39
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.

40
That's the kind of math
Joey likes to do.

41
Oh, PBS!

42
- What's wrong with PBS?
- What's right with them?

43
Why don't you like PBS?

44
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in this bad place, you know, personally.

45
So I just thought it would make me
feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.

46
Because they were so nice
when I was a little kid.

47
No one ever wrote back.

48
A lot of those Muppets
don't have thumbs.

49
All I got was a lousy keychain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.

50
I didn't have keys!

51
I'm sorry, Pheebs.

52
I just wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.

53
This isn't a good deed. You just want
to get on TV. This is totally selfish.

54
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55
What about you having
those babies for your brother?

56
Talk about selfish!

57
What are you talking about?

58
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?

59
Yeah, so?

60
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.

61
Look, there's no
unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

62
Yes, there are totally
good deeds that are selfless!

63
May I ask for one example?

64
Yeah, it's... You know, there's...

65
No, you may not!

66
That's because all people are selfish.

67
Are you calling me selfish?

68
Are you calling you people?

69
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.

70
Okay?

71
And you know the deal on Santa Claus,
right?

72
I'm gonna find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!

73
- Hello?
- Hello, Ross?

74
Emily?

75
Oh, my God! It's Emily!

76
It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!

77
Hi.

78
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.

79
Wait! Okay, okay, you can hang up,
but I'll keep calling everyone in England...

80
...if that's what it takes
to get you to talk to me.

81
Really? About what?

82
Look, you're my wife. We're married.

83
You know, I love you.

84
I really miss you.

85
I miss you too.

86
Well, at least I think I do.

87
She's talking.

88
When you said "the deal with Santa Claus,"
you meant?

89
That he doesn't exist.

90
Right.

91
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?

92
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.

93
So, Mon, when are we going
to meet this new, secret waiter man?

94
He's really shy. I don't think
he's up to meeting everyone yet.

95
Yeah, I don't think he's up
to meeting everyone yet.

96
I don't care, I wanna meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.

97
Really?

98
That's what you heard? You said that?

99
I might have said that.

100
Why is that funny?

101
Because I'm very happy for him.

102
And you! You lucky dog!

103
- Hi.
- Hey.

104
Well, Emily's willing to work
on the relationship.

105
- That's great!
- Yes!

106
In London.

107
- What?
- She wants me to move to London.

108
But you live here.

109
You know that.

110
What are you gonna do?

111
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...

112
...I could convince them
to move to London with Ben.

113
I'm sure your ex-wife would be more
than happy to move to another country...

114
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.

115
It could happen.

116
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.

117
This'll be your phone.

118
That's great.

119
But I'm not really
expecting a lot of calls.

120
No, you answer it and take pledges.

121
But I'm the host.

122
No, Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.

123
You don't seem to understand.
See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

124
Well, here's your phone, doctor.

125
I can't believe I can't find
a selfless good deed.

126
You know that really old guy
that lives next door to me?

127
I snuck over there and raked up
all the leaves on his front stoop.

128
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.

129
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!

130
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

131
I will find a selfless good deed.
Because I just gave birth to three children...

132
...and I will not let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!

133
Hey, Monica?
Can I ask you a cooking question?

134
- Sure.
- If you're cooking on the stove...

135
...does that mean that your new secret
boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?

136
Chandler.

137
Is he?

138
I think I'm going to respect the privacy
of my new, secret boyfriend.

139
Why?

140
If this guy was me...

141
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...

142
...I'd be going like this:

143
All right, Emily.

144
As much as I love you...

145
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.

146
I understand that would be difficult.

147
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.

148
Why can't you just do that?

149
I don't know. It's just...

150
Okay, okay, but I know that even though
I've been a complete idiot up till now...

151
...you have to come here.

152
You have to, so we can
work this out together.

153
All right.

154
All right? Did you just say "all right"?

155
I did. Now I'm the idiot.

156
Emily, that is so great!

157
It'll be great!

158
We're going to be
like two idiots in love!

159
Ross, there's one thing that
really scares me still.

160
- Yes, tell me.
- You have to understand...

161
...how humiliating it was
for me up on that altar...

162
...in front of my entire family,
all my friends.

163
I know. I am so sorry.

164
And then, after deciding
to forgive you...

165
...seeing you at the airport,
catching our plane with her.

166
Again, very sorry.

167
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.

168
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.

169
Emily, there is nothing
between Rachel and me.

170
Okay?

171
I love you.

172
All right.

173
I'll come to New York
and we'll try to make this work.

174
That is so great!

175
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.

176
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.

177
And she said yes.

178
- Great!
- No, no, no.

179
Only if I promise
never to see Rachel again.

180
What? You can't...

181
What did you tell her?

182
I told her I'd have to think about it.

183
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to
make this kind of a decision?

184
I'm actually asking you!

185
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.

186
She's one of your best friends.

187
But he can't not see Emily,
I mean that's his wife!

188
- That's true!
- Yeah, right?

189
But you've known Rachel since high school
and you cannot just cut her out of your life.

190
- That's true!
- No, you cannot.

191
Thanks for the help. Problem solved!

192
- Hello?
- Hey, Mon.

193
Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day.
When are you gonna be on TV?

194
There was kind of a mix-up
in my agent's office...

195
...but I'm still on TV,
and that's good exposure.

196
You're not on TV.

197
Oh, okay. How about now?

198
Yeah! There he is! There he is!

199
Hello, New York!

200
Maybe just put the whole duck
right in there. Who cares?

201
- Now I got the legs.
- Aw! Aw!

202
How many times have I told you guys
to never watch the cooking channel?

203
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey.

204
Listen, I need that broiling pan
that Joey borrowed the other day.

205
That was yours?

206
We used it when the duck
was throwing up caterpillars.

207
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page 27.

208
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.

209
Hey. Joey's gonna be at the telethon
for the rest of the day.

210
We have the whole place to ourselves.

211
Yeah, so?

212
Just thought maybe you'd want to book
some time with "the best you've ever had."

213
You know what, champ?

214
I think I'll pass.

215
- Why?
- Why?

216
What's your point?

217
PBS Telethon.

218
Hey, Joey.

219
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.

220
I went down to the park
and I let a bee sting me.

221
What good is that going to do anybody?

222
It helps the bee look tough
in front of his bee friends.

223
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.

224
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.

225
Damn it!

226
Back on in 30 seconds, people!

227
Excuse me,
would you mind switching with me?

228
No way. I'm in the shot, man.

229
- You've been here all day!
- I'm taking pledges.

230
And we're on three, two...

231
Welcome back to our fall telethon.

232
If you've been enjoying
the performance of Cirque du Soleil...

233
...and you'd like to see more of the same
kind of programming, it's very simple.

234
All you have to do is call in and pledge...

235
...and at that time tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you...

236
Okay.

237
That's it. I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.

238
So I'm just going leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.

239
A Magic 8 Ball?

240
You can't make this decision
with a toy!

241
It's not a toy.

242
I don't know what else to do!

243
I either keep my wife
and lose one of my best friends...

244
...or I keep my friend and get divorced
for the second time before I'm 30.

245
So if anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.

246
Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.

247
Any suggestion will do.

248
Okay, then.

249
Here we go.

250
Magic 8 Ball...

251
...should I never see Rachel again?

252
"Ask Again Later."

253
Later is not good enough!

254
"Ask Again Later."

255
What the hell?

256
This is broken! It is broken!

257
Let me see.

258
Will Chandler have sex tonight?

259
"Don't Count On it."

260
Seems like it works to me.

261
PBS Telethon.

262
Hi, Joey.

263
Hey, Pheebs.

264
I'd like to make a pledge.

265
I would like to donate $200.

266
Two hundred dollars?

267
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?

268
I'm still mad at them, but I also know
that they bring happiness...

269
...to lots of kids
whose moms didn't kill themselves.

270
You know, so...

271
...by supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.

272
So there! A selfless good deed.

273
And you don't feel a little good
about donating the money?

274
No, it sucks.
I was saving up to buy a hamster.

275
A hamster?
Those things are, like, 10 bucks.

276
Not the one I had my eye on.

277
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.

278
Thank you!

279
And the pledge that did it
was taken by one of our volunteers.

280
Oh, boy! And may I say,
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.

281
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!

282
Oh, look!

283
Joey's on TV!

284
Isn't that great?

285
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so...

286
Oh, no!

287
Look...

288
...maybe I got carried away before,
but there's something you gotta know.

289
If I'm the best, it's only
because you made me the best.

290
Keep talking.

291
I was nothing before you.

292
Call the other girls and ask.

293
Which wouldn't take long.

294
But when I'm with you,
and we're together...

295
...oh, my God!

296
- Really?
- Oh, my God!

297
Now, I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.

298
But that would be wrong.

299
We're too good.

300
We owe it to sex!

301
Well, if we owe it!

302
Oh, my!

303
When is Joey gonna be home?

304
I was kind of hoping
we could do this without him.

305
No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.

306
But I just cleaned the bathroom.

307
- Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves?
- Yeah.

308
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.

309
Okay. Ow!

310
- That wasn't part of it.
- I know.

311
Hi. You ready? We're going to be late.

312
- For what?
- For Stella, remember?

313
She's getting her groove back
in 20 minutes.

314
Yeah, I totally forgot about that.

315
Mind if I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.

316
Sure, I guess.

317
Hey, I hear you don't have to go
to London. Yay.

318
It's not that easy. There's still
a lot of relationship stuff.

319
Like what?

320
Just stuff.

321
You know, kind of what Emily wants.

322
Why don't you talk to me about it?
Maybe I can help.

323
No, no, you can't help.

324
I mean, I kind of have to do this
without your help.

325
Well, I...

326
I know you can do that too. I'm just saying
if you need somebody to talk to...

327
Hi.

328
Thanks.

329
Ross, look, whatever this
relationship stuff is that Emily wants...

330
...just give it to her.

331
The bottom line is that you love her.

332
So just fix whatever she wants fixed.

333
Just do it.

334
You're going to have to try.
You'll just hate yourself if you don't.

335
Come on, answer it!
It's driving me crazy.

336
Hello?

337
Hi, sweetie.

338
Good.

339
Look. Yes, I've been thinking...

340
...about that thing
you wanted me to do...

341
...and I can do it.

342
So will you come to New York?

343
What?

344
- Never done that before.
- Nope.

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey, ha, ha.

2
Monica?

3
What time is it?

4
Uh, 9.

5
But it's dark out.

6
Um, well, that's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

7
This is what 9 looks like.

8
I guess I'll get washed up then.

9
Watch that sunrise.

10
I'm really getting tired of
sneaking around all the time.

11
I know, me too. Hey, what if we went away
for the whole weekend? No interruptions.

12
And we could be naked the entire time.

13
All weekend?

14
- That's a whole lot of naked.
- Mm-hm.

15
Yeah, I could say I have a conference
and you can say you have a chef thing.

16
Oh, I've always wanted to go
to this culinary fair in Jersey!

17
Ha, ha, okay.
You know you're not, though.

18
- Right. Okay.
- Let's go.

19
Wait. What about Joey?

20
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.

21
Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.

22
How weird! Chandler just told us
he's got a conference there. Huh.

23
Oh, that's funny, ha, ha. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

24
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

25
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

26
Do you want people to think it's
a fake conference? It's a real conference.

27
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
- Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
- No, she's out shopping.

29
- Damn.
- What's going on?

30
I told Emily to come.

31
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

32
Wait a minute.

33
So when Emily comes,
you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?

34
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part, all right...

35
...and not on the part
that makes me do this, huh?

36
So you'll never be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?

37
I have no idea. I mean...

38
But I assure you, I will figure it out.

39
It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.

40
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

41
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
What's going on?

43
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

44
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up, and then we flip it.

45
That's better than my way.

46
Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?

47
- Oh, man.
- Oh.

48
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

49
So, Rach?

50
You know how Emily's coming, right?

51
Oh, yeah. I know.

52
Can you hear anything?

53
Oh, yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

54
Hey, Joey's ass.

55
What are you doing?

56
Remember when they got
in that big fight and broke up...

57
...and we were all stuck in here
all night with no food?

58
Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it was gonna happen again.

59
You know? So I hid this in here.

60
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...

61
Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!

62
Condoms?

63
Hey, you don't know how long
we're gonna be in here.

64
We may have to re-populate the Earth.

65
And condoms are the way to do that?

66
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

67
- The last time I talked to Emily...
- Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!

68
- What?
- Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!

69
LaPooh's still alive?

70
Oh! It says he was hit by
an ice-cream truck and dragged for...

71
...19 blocks!

72
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Sweetie, we heard you crying.

73
- Please don't cry.
- It's LaPooh!

74
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

75
I can't believe it! We're here!

76
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows!
Oh, I love that!

77
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

78
- Oh. Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

79
Oh, yes!

80
Monica, get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!

81
We're switching rooms.

82
Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!

83
No, they gave us glasses
with lipstick on them.

84
If they didn't change the glasses,
who knows what else they didn't change.

85
Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want
this weekend to be perfect, okay?

86
- We can change rooms, can't we?
- Okay.

87
Okay, but let's do it now, though,
because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!

88
Hey, so, uh...

89
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

90
Oh, yeah.

91
Well...

92
...you know I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

93
Mm-hm.

94
Well, there's this...

95
...one thing.

96
Okay, here goes.

97
I made a promise that... Oh, hey.

98
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

99
- Oh, God!
- You're bleeding.

100
Ah. Ah, not again.

101
This happened when my grandfather died.

102
It's... Ugh, sorry.

103
Oh, gross, unh.

104
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you wanna tell me?

105
- Um...
- Ugh.

106
Sorry. Sorry.

107
Okay.

108
I, uh...

109
I can't see you anymore.

110
Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either.

111
I think you'll find this room
more to your liking.

112
Okay, great.

113
They say he's only got half a tank left.

114
Half a tank? We still got a lot
of high-speed chasing to do!

115
- We're switching rooms again.
- What? Why?

116
This is a garden-view room
and we paid for an ocean-view room.

117
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

118
Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

119
Uh-huh.

120
- Chandler.
- Yeah?

121
Look, these clowns are trying to
take us for a ride. I won't let them.

122
We're not a couple of suckers.

123
I hear you, Mugsy.

124
But, look, all these rooms are fine.

125
Okay? Can you just pick one
so I can watch the...

126
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

127
- Okay, this one I like.
- Nothing.

128
Nothing. It's over.

129
Damn it, this is regularly scheduled
programming!

130
Can we turn the TV off, okay?

131
Do we really wanna spend
the weekend like this?

132
I'm sorry, am I getting in the way
of all the room-switching fun?

133
- Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
- Who should I blame?

134
The nice bellman who had to drag
our luggage to 10 rooms?

135
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

136
...from Albany to Canada
on a half a tank of gas?

137
Do not speak ill of the dead.

138
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

139
What's the matter with you?

140
I just wanna watch a little television.
What's the big deal?

141
Jeez, relax, Mom.

142
What did you say?

143
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

144
Hey.

145
Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

146
Okay. All right. What's up?

147
Okay.

148
You know how you told me I should do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

149
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

150
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

151
Yeah?

152
...is for me not to see you anymore.

153
Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
What are you gonna tell her?

154
Oh, my God.

155
Oh, you've already agreed to this,
haven't you?

156
It's awful, I know. Uh, it's... Heh.

157
I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

158
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

159
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

160
Oh!

161
Oh, lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

162
I think that's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

163
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. Uh, this is so hard.

164
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

165
- Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
- What are you doing?

166
- Storming out.
- Rachel, this is your apartment.

167
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

168
Damn Rolos!

169
- Hey, you're back.
- Hey.

170
How was your conference?

171
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues for the entire time.

172
Are you kidding with this?

173
Uh, so your weekend was a bust?

174
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

175
- Hi.
- Hey, you're back too.

176
Yeah. Um, Chandler,
could I talk to you outside for a second?

177
- How was your chef thing?
- Ugh. It was awful.

178
I guess some people don't
appreciate really good food.

179
Maybe it was the kind of food
that tasted good at first...

180
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

181
- Chandler.
- Monica.

182
I wanna know how much the room was.
I'll pay my half.

183
Okay, fine. $300.

184
- Three hundred dollars?
- Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.

185
What are you guys woofing about?

186
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

187
No!

188
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

189
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

190
...always have lots.

191
You should've seen the look on her face.

192
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

193
- You want my advice?
- Yes. Please.

194
- You're not gonna like it.
- That's okay.

195
You got married too fast.

196
- That's not advice.
- I told you.

197
I'm going to the bathroom.

198
Man, if anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I don't think I could do it.

199
Me neither.

200
Maybe I could do it.

201
- Hi.
- Hey.

202
I know you guys heard about
the whole thing with me and Ross.

203
But I've been obsessing about it all day
and would love not to talk about it.

204
Uh, I don't know if this falls
under that category...

205
...but, uh, Ross is right back there.

206
- That's not Ross.
- Oh, no, not that guy.

207
He does look like him, though.

208
Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.

209
Oh, my God. It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

210
- What?
- Yeah, you're not Kip.

211
Do you even know who Kip is?

212
Who cares? You're Rachel.

213
Who's Kip?

214
Kip, my old roommate.
We all hung out together.

215
- Oh, that poor bastard.
- Mm-hm.

216
See? You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

217
They broke up,
they couldn't be in the same room.

218
You all promised you'd stay his friend.

219
And what happened? He got phased out.

220
- You're not gonna be phased out.
- Well, of course I am.

221
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your old college roommate.

222
It was a matter of time
before someone had to leave the group.

223
I always assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

224
Honey, come on, you live far away,
you're not related.

225
You lift right out.

226
Hey.

227
Hey, Mr. Bing.

228
That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.

229
Said someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

230
Yes, that was mine.

231
I figured you hooked up with some girl
and she left it.

232
Yes, that would have made more sense.

233
You know, I don't even feel like
I know you anymore, man.

234
All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna
ask you this one time, all right?

235
And whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

236
Were you or were you not...

237
...on a gay cruise?

238
Phoebe.

239
I'm sorry about
the whole lifting-out thing.

240
You gotta come with me.

241
- Come where?
- Wherever I go.

242
Come on, you and me, we'll start
a new group. We're the best ones.

243
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

244
Pheebs, do you mind
if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?

245
Oh, sure, yeah.

246
Bye, Ross.

247
Forever.

248
- Ahem.
- Hi.

249
Hi.

250
What are you doing here?
Isn't this against the rules?

251
I talked to Monica.

252
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.

253
I'm the one who's making things change.

254
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

255
- Oh, Ross...
- No, no, it's okay. Really.

256
Plenty of people just see
their sisters at Thanksgiving...

257
...and just see their college roommates
at reunions...

258
...and just see Joey at Burger King.

259
So is that better?

260
No, it's not better.

261
I still don't get to see you.

262
Well, what would you do, Rach?
If you were me, what would you do?

263
Well...

264
...for starters, I would have said
the right name at my wedding.

265
I can't believe this is happening.

266
I know.

267
I am so sorry.

268
I know that too.

269
Ahem. Hey, Rach?

270
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Phoebe said
you wanted to talk to me about a trip.

271
- Hey.
- Hi.

272
I just came over to drop off...

273
...nothing.

274
So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?

275
Yeah, it did.

276
So I guess this is over?

277
- What?
- Well, you know, you and me.

278
I mean, it had to end sometime.

279
Why exactly?

280
Because of the weekend. We had a fight.

281
Chandler, that's crazy.

282
Ha, ha. If you give up every time
you have a fight with someone...

283
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than...

284
Oh.

285
So this isn't over?

286
You are so cute!

287
No, no. It was a fight.

288
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

289
- Really? Okay, great.
- Heh.

290
Aw. Welcome to an adult relationship.

291
We're in a relationship?

292
- I'm afraid so.
- Okay.

293
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw
Donald Trump at your convention.

295
Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.

296
Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

297
Yeah, it's in the bathroom.

298
Oh! Oh!

299
- Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Ooh, oh!

300
- Joey, I need to talk to you.
- Oh! Oh!

301
Oh, oh, oh!

302
Yes.

303
You? And you?

304
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

305
But how? When?

306
- It happened in London.
- In London!

307
The reason we didn't tell anyone was
we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.

308
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

309
No, no, no. You can't.

310
Please, please. We just don't wanna
deal with telling everyone.

311
Please, just promise you won't tell.

312
All right.

313
Man, this is unbelievable!

314
I mean, it's great! But...

315
- I know. It's great! Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

316
Oh, I don't wanna see that!

317
We're so stupid.

318
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey.

319
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe. Heh.

320
If you win, you must slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!"'

321
Oh, that's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

322
- But you know it doesn't count.
- For what?

323
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.

324
- I guess fun time's over.
- Yeah, I'm done.

325
Wait, guys, if we follow the rules...

326
...it's still fun and it means something.

327
I'm gonna take off.

328
Guys, rules are good!

329
Rules help control the fun.

330
Oh!

﻿1
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2
None of that.
Not while you're living under my roof.

3
What?

4
Look, just because I know about you two
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

5
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition for another hour?

6
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

7
And I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

8
Okay, look, if I have to pretend
I don't know about you two...

9
...then you two are gonna have to pretend
there's nothing to know about.

10
Okay, sorry.

11
I can hear that.

12
Rachel's at work.

13
I can still hear you.

14
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
Hey. What's that?

16
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom
that once belonged to my grandmother.

17
Can you believe it?

18
A year ago I didn't even have a family...

19
...and now I have heirlooms
for crying out loud.

20
- Oh, God!
- Aah!

21
Oh, soft.

22
- Is this mink?
- Yeah.

23
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

24
Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that
no innocent animals suffered to make.

25
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids
who worked their fingers bloody...

26
...for 12 cents an hour.

27
That didn't happen, I made that up.

28
- Hey.
- Ross?

29
Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.

30
How come? Everybody else does.

31
You can't.

32
What is that?

33
Oh, uh, I'm getting rid
of a couple of things.

34
This is all of your things.

35
Yes, yes, it is.

36
No, but it's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

37
Stuff that's just ours.
Together, you know, brand new.

38
So basically this is a "getting rid
of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.

39
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...

40
I'll take it all.

41
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?

42
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants...

43
...and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.

44
Okay, but don't you think
that's a little extreme?

45
- After what I did, can you blame her?
- Oh, my God. You got off easy.

46
When my friend Sylvie's husband
said someone else's name in bed...

47
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

48
What is he doing?

49
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

50
- Calm down, Joey.
- No.

51
Everything's getting all messed up,
you know?

52
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

53
We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel,
hence, Ross stops seeing us.

54
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.

55
Yeah, I know.
We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."

56
I'm not happy about this either, but,
you know, if Ross says he's happy...

57
...then we just have to keep our feelings
about Emily to ourselves.

58
Are you cool with that?

59
No.

60
But, you know, I'm an actor.

61
I'll act cool.

62
Ooh. Oh, God,
storage rooms give me the creeps.

63
Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.

64
If you want the little round waffles...

65
...you've gotta wait till I find
the little round waffle iron.

66
- I want the little round waffles.
- All right.

67
Here it is.

68
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

69
I wonder if the best place to put something
that cooks food is underneath the poison?

70
Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.

71
Fog him! Fog him!

72
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about this coat.

73
I'll take it.

74
- That might work.
- Oh, yeah, ha, ha.

75
Huh? All right, what do you think?

76
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

77
No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.

78
No, it's great, okay?
I am totally on board.

79
I love you too. All right, bye.

80
- What's the matter, Ross?
- Nothing. No. Oh, uh, actually...

81
...great news. Heh.

82
Um, just got off the phone with Emily...

83
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

84
Whoo-hoo!

85
- Why?
- Well, her thought is... And I agree.

86
- Fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

87
Her cousin has this great place to sublet.

88
It's got a view of the river on one side
and Columbia on the other.

89
That's way uptown.
That's like three trains away...

90
...which is great.

91
I love to ride that rail.

92
So you're really okay with this?

93
Yes, yes. I mean,
it's kind of far from work...

94
...but, uh, you know,
I'll get so much done on the commute.

95
I've been given the gift of time.

96
That's so funny, because last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

97
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

98
Now he's moving?

99
Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!

100
He's not even here.

101
You guys. You guys.

102
We were just in the storage area
and we saw this really creepy man.

103
He was like this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

104
He was like a Bigfoot
or a yeti or something.

105
He came at us with an ax,
so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.

106
Yeah, I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

107
Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard?

108
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you fogged Danny.

109
Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.

110
Who's Danny?

111
Danny just moved in downstairs.

112
He just got back from this four-month trek
in the Andes. Nice fella.

113
Oh, he's nice. He's nice.
You know, you always...

114
...stick up for the people we fog.

115
- Yeah?
- Hi.

116
You might not remember us,
but we are the girls that fogged you.

117
- We're really sorry we fogged you.
- Yeah.

118
Okay.

119
Hi, uh, just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

120
We actually thought you were
like a yeti or something.

121
Okay.

122
Yes?

123
Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...

124
...but I don't think that we can accept
your acceptance of our apology.

125
It just doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

126
Okay.

127
Wow. That guy is so rude.

128
Really. What is with that guy?

129
I mean, you'd forgive me
if I fogged you.

130
Well, you did, a little bit.

131
Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.

132
- I totally forgive you.
- Really?

133
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
So listen, you know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

135
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

136
Well, he said that he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

137
...if I, um, you know, bring in
the next person I know who dies.

138
Oh, my God.

139
Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.

140
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

141
Wha...?

142
Phoebe? Ha. Honey?

143
Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get
a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.

144
But if you destroy a coat like this...

145
...I mean, that is like a crime
against nature.

146
Not nature. Fashion.

147
This is fashion?

148
Okay, so to you, death is fashion?

149
That's really funny.
Yeah, here's Phoebe, uh...

150
...sporting, you know,
cutting-edge hairy carcass...

151
...from, you know,
the steel traps of wintry Russia.

152
I mean, you really think this looks good?

153
Because I do.

154
I know, I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

155
I love you. Bye.

156
Okay, what is in here, rocks?

157
No, this is my collection
of, uh, fossil samples.

158
So rocks.

159
I'm really gonna miss this apartment.
Heh.

160
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

161
Hey, remember when I ran into this thing
and it kind of knocked me out a little?

162
I love this place.

163
To tell you the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

164
Uh, are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

165
Well, I mean, if, uh,
Emily gave me a choice...

166
You do have a choice.

167
Ross, why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

168
What?

169
It's not right what Emily wants you to do.
She is totally... Ow!

170
Stop pinching me.

171
You guys said I only had to keep my mouth
shut as long as Ross was happy, right?

172
Well, he just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

173
What's going on?

174
We all hate Emily.

175
- No.
- No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

176
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

177
...a whole lot to make her happy.

178
Yeah.

179
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

180
Yes, yes, unreasonable.

181
Unreasonable?

182
How about we have this conversation
when one of you guys gets married?

183
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

184
It's about compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

185
Do you do it? Yes.

186
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

187
...drinking coffee at Central Perk
all the time. It's real life, okay?

188
It's what grownups do.

189
I think he's right.

190
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse
way too much.

191
- God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
- Ugh, I know.

192
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

193
Kind of?

194
If you just kept this to yourself,
none of this would have happened.

195
Well, I'm keeping so many things
to myself these days...

196
...something was bound to slip out.

197
Well, I think it's very brave
what you said.

198
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.

199
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat?
How about the whole animal rights thing?

200
Well, ahem, I've been reading up,
and for your information...

201
...minks are not very nice.

202
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

203
It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

204
Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.

205
Hi.

206
- So you like the short hair better?
- What?

207
Yeti? Uh, Danny?

208
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the, uh...

209
...fogger smell.
- Oh.

210
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

211
...you know, if you hadn't looked so...
You know, um...

212
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

213
- What?
- That's cool. That's cool.

214
What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no,
that is not cool.

215
You don't even know me.

216
Come on. You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalogue.

217
So from that, you think
you've got me all figured out?

218
Well, you don't.

219
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

220
Do you?

221
Well, you know,
if kids like to play with capri pants.

222
Okay.

223
And stop saying that. I hate that.

224
Okay.

225
Fine. I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

226
But you did it too, and you're worse...

227
...because you are sticking
to your stupid snap judgment.

228
You can't even open up your mind for a
second to see that you might be wrong.

229
What does that say about you?

230
That pizza place
across the street any good?

231
- What?
- I'm hungry.

232
You wanna get some pizza?
You can keep yelling if there's more.

233
Okay.

234
- Okay.
- Stop saying that. I hate that.

235
Uh, Ross?

236
- Are you still mad at us?
- Yup.

237
Oh, good, because we have
an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.

238
You know what?
I'm really not in the mood.

239
Look, Ross.

240
I feel really bad. I mean,
you're going through all this stuff...

241
...and I just acted like a jerk.

242
- Yeah, we are so sorry.
- You're stepping on the song.

243
Look, we were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

244
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

245
Okay, now you're just taking lines
right out of the song.

246
Look, this is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

247
Yes, exactly. And that's why...

248
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make you your favorite dinner?

249
Come on.

250
Okay.

251
Thanks, you guys.

252
Pheebs, are you wearing fur?

253
Okay, let's get some perspective, people.

254
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat.

255
You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

256
- You do, huh?
- Yeah, you see, um...

257
...I'm an actor, right?

258
So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface, you know?

259
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know what I mean?

260
It's tough. Guys like me, you know,
you wander around, you're alone.

261
What are you talking about?

262
I'm not sure.

263
- Hi.
- Hey, look at you. Where have you been?

264
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.

265
- How did that happen?
- That yeti is one smooth talker.

266
I hope you're not too full,
because dinner's almost ready.

267
Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably
just gonna hang out in my room.

268
- Oh, no.
- Why?

269
Come on, you guys.

270
Listen, if Emily knew I was here having
dinner with you, she would flip out...

271
...and you know it.

272
It's okay. I really... I don't mind.

273
Wait, wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

274
Please.

275
It would really mean a lot for me
if you stay.

276
Ross, I just...

277
Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.

278
Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.

279
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

280
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

281
Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.

282
We haven't seen him in so long.

283
Oh, God.
I really missed that fat bastard.

284
Wow. This is so weird.

285
I just realized this may be the last time
we're all hanging out together.

286
It's almost as if he knew.

287
I'll get it.

288
Hello?

289
Hi, Emily.

290
Yeah, uh, you tracked him down.
Hold on one second.

291
Hey.

292
Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.

293
Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.

294
She wants to say hi. Hold on.

295
Hi, Emily.

296
Hello, everyone.

297
So who am I saying hello to?

298
Well, uh, I don't know
about who's here...

299
...but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here, and that's Rachel.

300
Well, I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.

301
You know what? Uh, Rachel is here.

302
She's there?

303
Oh, yeah, there she is.

304
Yeah. Yeah, she's here.

305
Ross, take me off speakerphone.

306
- Hi.
- How could you do this to me?

307
I thought I'd made my feelings
about Rachel perfectly clear.

308
Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

309
- You obviously can't keep away from her.
- That's ridiculous.

310
Look, I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.

311
Please, just get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

312
You'll see you're the only person
I want to be with.

313
I'll feel better when I'm there
and I can know where you are all the time.

314
Well, you can't know where I am
all the time.

315
Look, this marriage is never gonna work
if you don't trust me.

316
You're right.

317
So... can you trust me?

318
No.

319
I think it's going okay.

320
Looks like he's smiling.

321
How can you tell?
You can only see the back of his head.

322
You can totally tell.

323
Here, look, watch me.

324
Smile. Frown. Smile. Frown. Smile.

325
Well, I guess that's it.

326
Why? What happened?

327
My marriage is over.

328
- What?
- Oh, sweetie.

329
Oh, look at you, you're shivering.

330
Here.

331
Ross, honey,
is there anything we can do?

332
Yeah.

333
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

334
Okay, stop tormenting me.

335
This is mink, okay?
They're mean, and they hate squirrels.

336
And, you know, most of these
probably wanted to be coats.

337
All right, fine. No, I get it. Here.

338
You take it.

339
Are you happy now? I'm cold.

﻿1
Are you looking
at naked tribeswomen?

2
No, look.

3
That's a pig.

4
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!

5
- Hey.
- Hey.

6
Emily's cousin kicked me out.

7
- What?
- Why?

8
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...

9
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.

10
Didn't you sign a lease?

11
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?

12
You can stay with us.

13
Anything you need.

14
But you have to let us know
when you feel better...

15
...so we can make fun of your hair.

16
- You got it.
- Okay.

17
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.

18
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.

19
- What?
- He thought you said gonad.

20
Wow, Monica. If every place were this clean,
it'd be tough making a living.

21
Ha, oh, Larry!

22
Um, do health inspectors
work on commission?

23
No, bribes.

24
- Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
- I was just kidding.

25
- I'll check the kitchen floor.
- Knock yourself out.

26
Yummy! Heh.

27
Larry?

28
Yeah, I'd let him check out
my kitchen floor.

29
A 98.

30
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.

31
That is a Section 5 violation.

32
Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.

33
Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.

34
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.

35
- Where's your hat?
- In the kitchen. I'll get it.

36
Ah, there's the two points!

37
You should really read
that book you wrote.

38
Wow.

39
You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew
she'd go in hatless to get it, heh.

40
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.

41
Ah, I don't know about that.

42
But then I could be
your sidekick, Voonda, heh.

43
Maybe, uh, I could ask Voonda
to dinner sometime?

44
She would love that...

45
...since you know
all the clean places to eat, heh.

46
I'll call you.

47
Okay.

48
He's so funny! Whoa, oh.

49
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

50
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?

51
He's not great.
But, um, he's dealing with it.

52
- Oh.
- Wait, you're not...

53
Oh, I can't get started
with all that Ross stuff again.

54
He'll be screwed up for a long time.

55
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.

56
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.

57
- Two pounds of mocha java.
- It's Danny.

58
Are you going to go out again?

59
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.

60
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt. I'm all...

61
...and then nothing.

62
- Hey.
- Hi, Danny.

63
Wow, thirsty, huh?

64
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.

65
- Oh, fun.
- Oh, great!

66
- Really looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

67
See you!

68
So I guess we won't
be warming his house.

69
Oh, ha, ha, okay.

70
All right, I see what he's doing.

71
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.

72
And you won't do that.

73
That's right!

74
Because that would give him
the control.

75
So now he comes up with this
"I've got a party" thing...

76
...to get me to hint
for an invitation.

77
Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.

78
So there is no party?

79
No, there's a party.
There's a party.

80
But the power?

81
That is still up for grabs.

82
You follow me?

83
I think so.

84
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?

85
Exactly!

86
Ross?

87
Hey, roomies!

88
I love what you've done
with the place.

89
Oh, I know it's a lot of boxes.

90
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- Not a problem.

91
Since you'll be here a while...

92
...we, uh, could put your name
on the answering machine.

93
Oh, I, uh, hope you don't mind...

94
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.

95
Check it out.

96
We will
We will call you back

97
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Oh, yes.

98
- You're fake laughing too, right?
- The tears are real.

99
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

100
- You look beautiful this evening.
- Heh.

101
Show me the badge again.

102
Shiny, ha, ha.

103
Oh, you mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?

104
You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!

105
- We're out of here.
- Why?

106
I saw ten violations.
I'm shutting this place down!

107
- You have the power to do that?
- This does.

108
Shut it down.

109
Hey.

110
What are you doing?

111
Nothing.

112
You built a fort, didn't you?

113
Kind of, heh.

114
Oh, my God! The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.

115
All I heard for four years
through college was...

116
You should have gone out
once in a while.

117
- I hate this thing!
- Come on, Chandler.

118
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.

119
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?

120
- Oh, hi, Danny.
- Hey, guys.

121
Uh, I wanted to invite you to the party.

122
Oh, thanks, I'll try to stop by.

123
Actually, I think, ahem,
I'm going to be busy.

124
You are?

125
Yeah.

126
Remember? I've got that, uh, gala.

127
What's the gala for?

128
Uh, it's a, um...

129
It's, uh, a regatta gala.

130
Do you sail?

131
No, but I support it.

132
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.

133
Okay.

134
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?

135
What one?

136
You wanted him to invite you
and he did.

137
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes...

138
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.

139
But I said no...

140
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.

141
So the ball is in his court?

142
Ball?

143
No, there's no ball.

144
Joey, please.

145
Sorry.

146
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

147
You want to play some foosball?
Please?

148
- Okay.
- No, no, no.

149
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes, ha, ha.

150
Come on!

151
I have one question.

152
What is the deal with this?

153
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?

154
No, the quiet down thing.

155
Oh. You mean this.

156
Mm-hm.

157
I don't know how much more
I can take.

158
Did you know he taped over my
Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?

159
My God!

160
- What if that had been porn?
- Oh!

161
All right, this may be tough...

162
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.

163
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.

164
- Let's have a game.
- Okay.

165
Don't be scored on. No, no, no.

166
Yes. Ha-ha-ha.

167
Uh, fellas?

168
- So he's out of here.
- Mm-hm.

169
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.

171
Oh, I took Larry there, but it was all
violated, so we shut it down.

172
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?

173
I don't know. Clean places?

174
Mm, yum!

175
It's Danny.

176
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.

177
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?

178
What kind of a regatta gala
starts at night?

179
The fake kind.

180
- Um, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
- We have a ladle.

181
See you at the party.

182
Okay, great.

183
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."

184
I'm done. You want anything?
Uh, sports? International?

185
Apartment listings?

186
I'll take sports.

187
Mine!

188
All right, uh, international.

189
That's mine too.

190
I'm Italian.

191
I could check apartment listings,
though there's never anything here.

192
Not even on page seven?

193
Oh, yeah.

194
You're right.
Oh, here's an affordable place.

195
Two bedroom, close to work.
Ooh, it's available in five weeks.

196
What about that circled one?

197
Ooh, I don't know.
It's kind of expensive for a studio.

198
But it's available now.

199
Isn't it?

200
Yes, it is.

201
Let's go look at it, heh!

202
- Oh, okay. Let's go.
- There we go! Yay!

203
Oh, oh, oh, guys, would you, uh, chip in
for some new air filters for the purifier?

204
I mean, after all,
we are all using it.

205
Let's go quicker!

206
Yeah.

207
- Oh, my God!
- Mm.

208
Oh, look at this kitchen/bathroom.

209
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.

210
Somebody was using his head.

211
Let's check out
the rest of the place.

212
I think this is it.

213
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.

214
But this place is available now.

215
You don't want to be stuck
with us for five weeks.

216
So you think I should
take this place?

217
Oh, it's perfect!

218
How about you?

219
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.

220
Ah, I see what you guys are saying.

221
I'll, uh, go downstairs
and fill out an application.

222
We are bad people.

223
He knew we were trying
to get rid of him.

224
Could we get a bathtub
in our kitchen?

225
Ready for dinner?

226
- Ooh, absolutely.
- Great.

227
You wanted to go to
the Italian place on Bleecker St?

228
Oh, I love that place, ha, ha.

229
- So no.
- Oh.

230
How about Mama Lozetti's?

231
Yuck.

232
Sure.

233
How long has that milk
been sitting out?

234
No, this place is totally healthy.

235
This milk is mine.
I bought this today...

236
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?

237
Okay, let's go.

238
Hey, buddy.

239
Health Code 11 B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.

240
But then I have to go
all the way around.

241
So you choose convenience
over health?

242
Stop, Larry.

243
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?

244
It was exciting at first.

245
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?

246
I suppose I could give him a warning.

247
Thank you.

248
Go, go!

249
If, after dinner,
you still need to bust someone...

250
...I know a hot dog vendor
who picks his nose.

251
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.

252
That was a nice place.

253
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.

254
What do we do?

255
I don't know.

256
Maybe pizza?

257
- About Ross!
- Oh.

258
Hello.

259
Oh, yeah.

260
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.

261
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable...

262
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that, uh, barks into the night.

263
Well, who doesn't love dogs?

264
Uh, he's a tap dancer.

265
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.

266
He's a pimp!

267
There you go. He's a pimp.

268
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!

269
Hello?

270
Oh.

271
Watching for a sound
To lead me to wherever...

272
Shh, this is never going to work.
He's right there.

273
Just go say hi.

274
I have to go downstairs and back up,
as if I'm coming home from the gala.

275
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.

276
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey.

277
What's going on?

278
This is a great party.
Great food, ha, ha.

279
Oh, you know, most parties, it's, uh,
all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.

280
So, um...

281
What's this?

282
Salad.

283
Oh.

284
And what's this?

285
Bread.

286
Aren't you a chef?

287
Oh.

288
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

289
Oh, right, tonight was your party.

290
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.

291
Oh, well, you know,
the gala had to end sometime.

292
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

293
- Yeah, sure.
- All right?

294
Whose court is the ball in now?

295
I thought there wasn't a ball.

296
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.

297
Ball's flying all over the place.

298
This is my friend, Tom.

299
This is the girl I told you about.

300
Oh, come on!
You telling people about me?

301
I think you two
could really hit it off.

302
I'm gonna go mingle.

303
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."

304
Yeah, okay.

305
At ease, soldier, heh.

306
I'm sorry?

307
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.

308
You're Danny's wingman, right?

309
You guys are best buds, frat bros.

310
I'm going to go talk to, uh, a friend.

311
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.

312
Go tell him, "Nice try."

313
He just keeps lobbing them up...

314
...and I keep knocking them
right out of the park.

315
I think I need a drink.

316
Yeah.

317
Ninety-eight...

318
...ninety-nine...

319
...one hundred!

320
Okay. Go.

321
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

322
Here we go, here we go.

323
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
So I, uh, didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.

325
You're kidding?

326
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so...

327
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.

328
You don't need me
taking up all your space.

329
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.

330
Please, just stay.

331
Yeah.

332
Are you sure?

333
- Definitely.
- You have to stay.

334
- All right.
- All right, buddy.

335
So I'm a pimp, huh?

336
It's okay.

337
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.

338
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.

339
And I'll do everything I can
to keep my annoying habits just...

340
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

341
The cowboy hat's a little much.

342
Come on, it's fun!

343
All right.

344
Isn't this a woman's hat?

345
Dude, stop talking crazy,
and make us some tea!

﻿1
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

2
It was so good. I think you killed us.

3
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

4
I need something sweet.

5
Does anyone wanna watch TV?

6
Yeah. Sure.

7
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

8
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.

9
Oh.

10
Oh, forget it.

11
Hey, you know what we should all do?

12
We should play that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankful for.

13
Oh, I... I am thankful for this
beautiful fall we've been having.

14
- Very nice.
- Sweet, Joe.

15
Yeah, the other day,
I was at the bus stop...

16
...and this lovely fall breeze
came in out of nowhere...

17
...and blew this chick's skirt right up.

18
Oh, which reminds me,
I'm also thankful for thongs.

19
It's not so much an underpant
as it is a feat of engineering.

20
It's amazing how much they can do
with so little material.

21
And the way they play with your mind.
I mean, is it there? Is it not there?

22
Are you aware that you're still talking?

23
Is anyone thankful for anything else
besides a thong?

24
Huh. I don't know what to pick.

25
Am I more thankful for my divorce,
or my eviction? Hmm.

26
Wow, see, and I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.

27
I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst
Thanksgiving ever.

28
No, no, no. I am the king
of bad Thanksgivings.

29
You can't just swoop in here
with your bad marriage...

30
...and take that away from me.

31
You're not gonna tell the whole story...

32
...about how your parents
got divorced, are you?

33
No, no.

34
Come on. I want to hear it.

35
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.

36
It's a tradition, like the parade.

37
If the parade decided it was gay, moved out
and abandoned its entire family.

38
Now, Chandler, dear.

39
Just because your father and I
are getting a divorce...

40
...doesn't mean we don't love you.

41
It just means...

42
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.

43
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?

44
You're right, yours is worse.
You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.

45
I don't know about that.
I've got one that's worse.

46
Really? Worse than:

47
"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"

48
Did the little rich boy
had a problem with the butler?

49
Yes, mine's worse.

50
More bandages! More bandages!

51
Please, can I get
some more bandages in here?

52
This man is... Aah!

53
Oh, no.

54
In this life, Phoebe.

55
Oh, this life.

56
Oh, okay. No, Chandler's is worse.

57
Man, it must be so cool
remembering stuff like that.

58
I don't have any past life memories.

59
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

60
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

61
- Oh, let's not tell this story.
- Oh, come on.

62
Oh, no! I know! I know!

63
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

64
- What?
- What?

65
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

66
Hey, it's not like it sounds.

67
It's exactly like it sounds.

68
Hello?

69
Hello?

70
- Phoebe?
- Joey?

71
What's going on?

72
Oh, my God.

73
I know.

74
It's stuck.

75
Step. How did it get on?

76
I put it on to scare Chandler.

77
Oh, my God.
Monica's going to totally freak out.

78
Well, then help me get it off.

79
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

80
Of course it smells really bad.
You have your head up a dead animal.

81
- Hey.
- Hey.

82
Hey, did you get the turkey...?
Oh, my God!

83
Oh, my God!

84
Who is that?

85
It's Joey.

86
What are you doing?
Is this supposed to be funny?

87
No, it's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.

88
Get that off now.

89
I can't. It's stuck.

90
Well, I don't care.
That turkey has to feed 20 people.

91
They're not going to eat it off your head.

92
Hold on, okay? Let's just all think.

93
Okay, I got it. Phoebe?

94
All right. You pull.

95
I'm gonna spread the legs
as wide as I can.

96
- Joey, now is not the time.
- Yeah. Sorry. Right, sorry.

97
Okay, count to three. One, two...

98
...three.

99
It worked. I scared you. I knew it. Ha, ha!

100
- I'm over here, big guy.
- Yeah, you are. Ha, ha!

101
I scared you. Whoo!

102
You did look like an idiot.

103
Hey, I wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot, all right?

104
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash"...

105
...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?

106
Yeah, that's the same.

107
That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.

108
Oh, wait. That can't be the one
that Rachel was talking about...

109
...because she didn't even know
that that happened.

110
- So, what's yours?
- What was it?

111
Um, I really don't wanna tell this story.

112
Oh, come on, Monica.

113
Reliving past pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.

114
You know, for me, anyway.
And, of course, the Indians.

115
Look, of all people,
you do not want me to tell this story.

116
What is that supposed to mean?

117
Monica, I think Rachel's here.

118
I'll get it.

119
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Not for me.

120
Chip and I broke up.

121
Oh. Why?

122
Well, what happened?

123
You know how my parents are out of town,
and Chip was gonna come over?

124
Yeah, yeah. And you were
gonna give him, you know...

125
...your "flower."

126
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?

127
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.

128
Okay, and by the way...

129
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
is not called his "tenderness."

130
Believe me.

131
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel.

132
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too, sweetheart.

133
Hey.

134
Oh. Hi.

135
Uh, everyone...

136
...this is Chandler.

137
My roommate
and lead singer of our band. Heh.

138
Ross?

139
Oh. This is Monica.

140
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

141
Okay.

142
I'm so glad you could come, Chandler.

143
We've got plenty of food,
so I hope you're hungry.

144
Oh, Mom, no, no,
Chandler hates Thanksgiving...

145
...and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

146
Oh. Well, I'm so glad
you brought him here, then.

147
Hey, Chandler, um...

148
If you want, I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

149
As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it,
then I'm in.

150
Damn it.

151
So, uh, Rach...

152
Does it...? Does it feel weird
around here now?

153
You know,
since I've been away at college?

154
Oh.

155
No, not really.

156
That's cool.

157
So...

158
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut, Nancy Branson.

159
I am never going out with him again.

160
I don't care how much he begs.

161
I think his begging days are over,
now that he's with Nancy Branson.

162
You know what?
I've just had it with high-school boys.

163
They're just silly.

164
They're just silly, stupid boys.

165
I'm gonna start dating men.

166
Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.

167
I couldn't find that bowl
you and Jack were looking for.

168
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.

169
Monica.

170
Hey, Chandler?

171
Did you like
the macaroni and cheese?

172
Oh, yeah. It was great.
You should be a chef.

173
Okay.

174
Guess what.

175
All this stuff about Nancy Branson
being a slut was all a rumor.

176
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house tonight.

177
- Oh, that is so great.
- I know.

178
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...

179
...um, promise me
you'll tell me everything?

180
Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once, you know.

181
I know, but this time you're gonna
definitely know whether or not you did it.

182
I know.

183
Oh, and Chip promised that this time
it would last at least for an entire song.

184
So I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight.

185
You know, maybe playing her that song
we wrote last week.

186
- "Emotional Knapsack"? Right on.
- Right on.

187
Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.

188
Right, Clifford Alvarez?

189
Listen, Roland Cheng...

190
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.

191
Dude, don't do that to me.

192
Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

193
It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here
all night with your fat sister.

194
Hey.

195
Monica, why don't you finish off
these pies?

196
I don't have any more room in the fridge.

197
No.

198
No, thank you.

199
Well, Judy, you did it.

200
She's finally full.

201
I called you fat?

202
- I don't even remember that.
- Well, I do.

203
I'm so sorry. I really am.
But, come on, I was an idiot back then.

204
I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert,
for crying out loud.

205
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.

206
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.

207
I am really sorry.

208
That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.

209
Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.

210
- Yes, it was.
- No, it wasn't. It was actually...

211
Thanksgiving's over.
Get ready for Christmas.

212
Who wants to get a Christmas tree?

213
Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.

214
We wanna hear Monica's
Thanksgiving story.

215
Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf
that got broke in half.

216
But, you know, whatever.

217
So, Rachel, your mom tells me
you changed your major again?

218
Oh, yeah, I had to.

219
There was never any parking
by the Psychology building.

220
- Hi, Rachel.
- Oh, hi.

221
- Wow. Love your new nose.
- Jack.

222
What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.

223
He removed my mole cluster.

224
Want to see?

225
No, God. Please, let me.

226
- Hey.
- Hey.

227
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

228
God, your hair sure is different.

229
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

230
Can't we can't believe
how stupid we used to look.

231
So, uh, where's Monica?

232
She's upstairs. Monica.

233
Come down, everyone's here.

234
Ross, Rachel and the boy
who hates Thanksgiving.

235
Hi, Chandler.

236
Oh, my God.

237
What's the matter?

238
Is there something on my dress?

239
You just... You look so different. Terrific.

240
That dress, that body...

241
- Dude.
- Sorry.

242
Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.

243
But what we really want to hear about
is Ross' new girlfriend.

244
Oh, Mom... Okay.

245
Um, ahem, her name is Carol...

246
...and she's really pretty and smart.

247
And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team
and the golf team.

248
Can you believe it?

249
She plays for both teams.

250
So, Chandler,
I guess I'll see you at dinner.

251
- Dude.
- Sorry.

252
Oh, my God.

253
That was so awesome.

254
You totally got him back
for calling you fat.

255
He was just drooling all over you.

256
- That must have felt so great.
- Well, it didn't.

257
What?

258
Yeah, I mean, I look great.

259
And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah,
my heart's not in trouble anymore.

260
Blah, blah, blah.

261
I just don't feel like I got him back,
you know?

262
I mean, I just want to humiliate him.

263
I want him to be, like, naked...

264
...and I want to point at him
and I wanna laugh.

265
Okay. That, we may be able to do.

266
How?

267
Well, guys tend to get naked
before they're gonna have sex.

268
What? I mean, I didn't work this hard
and lose all this weight...

269
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.

270
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one is ever gonna take it.

271
And then second of all, you're not gonna
actually have sex with him.

272
You're just gonna make him think
that you are.

273
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

274
And then when he's naked...

275
...I can throw him out, lock the door...

276
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him.

277
And then you will definitely
get him back.

278
Okay, so how do I make him think
I want to have sex?

279
Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.

280
Just act like everything around you
turns you on.

281
- What do you mean?
- Well, like, anything can be sexy.

282
Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.

283
Ooh, ooh.

284
This feels so good against my cheek.

285
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.

286
Or I can bring it down to my side
and maybe run it through my fingers...

287
...while I talk to him.

288
- I can do that.
- Okay, good, good, good.

289
Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.

290
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

291
I was wondering if you could make me
some mac and cheese...

292
...like last year?

293
I'd love to.

294
Ooh.

295
I love macaroni and cheese.

296
I love the way this box feels
against my cheek.

297
- Okay.
- Ooh, and I love carrots.

298
Oh!

299
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.

300
Like this.

301
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.

302
Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...

303
...um, I like to pick up this knife.

304
And, um, I put the cool steel...

305
...against, um...

306
...my body.

307
Are you all right?

308
I'm fine.

309
- What do got?
- Twenty-year-old male.

310
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.

311
Ow!

312
Could you please not do that feet first?

313
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

314
It says here the knife
went right through your shoe.

315
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.

316
- Did you bring the toe?
- Oh, yes.

317
I have it right here on ice.

318
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then...

319
- What is it?
- You brought a carrot.

320
- What?
- This isn't your toe.

321
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.

322
You brought a carrot?

323
Oh, my God.

324
There's a toe in my kitchen.

325
God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.

326
It's too late.
All we can do is sew up the wound.

327
- Without my toe? I need my toe.
- Okay.

328
No, no, no. I can go really fast.
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

329
Oh, I'm not falling for that one.

330
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?

331
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.

332
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?

333
I'm sorry.

334
It wasn't your whole toe.

335
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.

336
It's the best part.

337
It has the nail.

338
Chandler...

339
Sir Limps-a-lot.

340
I came up with that.

341
You're a dork.

342
- I can't believe this.
- Chandler, I said I was sorry.

343
Yeah, well, "sorry" doesn't bring back
the little piggy that cried all the way home.

344
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it.

345
- I'll see you later.
- Wait, Chandler.

346
Come here.

347
Is there anything I can do? Anything?

348
Yeah, just leave me alone
for a little while.

349
Oh, I'm a duck. I go quack-quack.
I'm happy all the time.

350
Nice try.

351
Wait, wait, wait.

352
- Look, Monica...
- Look.

353
This is not gonna work.

354
I bet this will work.

355
You're so great. I love you.

356
What?

357
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

358
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this.

359
No, I didn't.

360
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

361
You love me.

362
No, I don't. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

363
Gauze!

364
Gauze!
I need to get some gauze in here!

365
Can I please get some more gauze?

366
This is getting ridiculous.

﻿1
What am I sitting on?

2
Top of the world?

3
Dock of the bay?

4
I'm out.

5
- Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
- Oh!

6
All right, whose are they?

7
- Whose are they?
- Not mine.

8
Joey's. Got to be Joey's.

9
They're mine.

10
See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

11
Why are they here?

12
I don't know, uh...

13
I'm Joey.

14
I'm disgusting.

15
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

16
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

17
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18
- Take them!
- I got them.

19
You can touch them. They're yours.

20
Chandler? A word?

21
Yeah.

22
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop. Aah.

23
Tighty-whiteys? What are you, 8?

24
Thank you, Joey, so much.

25
You're not welcome, okay?

26
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

27
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

28
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

29
Then one thing led
to another and...

30
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

31
It was. All right, listen...

32
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

33
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

34
Yeah, actually.

35
We'll be more careful.

36
We don't want them to know,
because it's going really well.

37
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

38
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

39
- We are. Help us.
- Help.

40
All right. But you do it with me once.

41
Joey!

42
Didn't think so.

43
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Pheebs.

44
What are you reading?

45
Um, Wuthering Heights.

46
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

47
You're taking a class? That's so cool.

48
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

49
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

50
...with a less painful final exam.

51
That sounds like fun.

52
Oh, you should come with me!

53
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

54
Okay.

55
Yay! Okay.
Ooh, but, do you have time to read it?

56
I read it in school.

57
This is going to be so much fun!
Shh. I have to finish.

58
Hi.

59
What's wrong, buddy?

60
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

61
What did the police say?

62
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

63
I can't believe someone ate it.

64
It's just a sandwich.

65
Just a sandwich?

66
I am 30 years old, okay?

67
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

68
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

69
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

70
I have enough for one more sandwich.

71
I was going to eat it myself, but...

72
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

73
I still can't believe someone ate it!

74
Look, I left a note and everything.

75
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

76
"Ross Geller's lunch."

77
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

78
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

79
I'm surprised you didn't wear it home.
Ha-ha-ha.

80
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

81
I learned that on the street.

82
Really?

83
What would you say, Pheebs?

84
Stuff like, uh,
"Keep your mitts off my grub."

85
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?

86
This'll keep them away from your stuff.

87
Whoa!

88
Phoebe, you are a badass!

89
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

90
- Phoebe.
- He stabbed me first!

91
The Brontë sisters were
remarkable women for their time.

92
They lived in a patriarchal society.

93
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.

94
- Ahem.
- Okay.

95
So, what is the book about?

96
Didn't you read it in high school?

97
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

98
And I was on top of the pyramid.

99
But anyway, um...

100
...what's the book about?

101
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

102
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

103
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

104
I totally get symbolism.

105
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

106
Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?

107
Ahem, um...

108
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

109
That's sort of a given...

110
...but, yes. Anyone else?

111
Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!

112
And the wildness of the moors...

113
...which I think, is mirrored...

114
...in the wildness
of, uh, Heathcliff's character.

115
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here...

116
You completely stole my answer!

117
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

118
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

119
What do you think?
Uh, you in the blue shirt?

120
I think that, um, yours is a question
with many possible answers.

121
Would you care to venture one?

122
Are you just repeating me?

123
All right. Let's move on.

124
Okay, then.

125
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

126
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.

127
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

128
- Phoebe! Phoebe!
- Yeah?

129
Your note?

130
Amazing!

131
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

132
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

133
A guy called me "Mental."

134
"Mental Geller."

135
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

136
The best you got in high school
was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."

137
It was the water fountain, okay?

138
Anyway...

139
...people are writing reports for me...

140
...uh, pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

141
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

142
...and you can get anything you want.

143
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

144
This was really fun.

145
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

146
So you, uh, still wondering?

147
No. We just went out.

148
You're smart.

149
I like that.

150
Oh.

151
Oh, candles!

152
What is that, a blanket?

153
A video camera? Oh, my God!

154
No, no, no. Wait.

155
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

156
Hi.

157
Joey, is what she just said, um...

158
Oh, my God!

159
You're actually going...

160
What is going on here?

161
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

162
I'm Joey.

163
I mean, I'm disgusting.

164
I make low-budget adult films.

165
Huh.

166
You promised to be more careful!

167
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

168
We're so sorry.

169
I'm telling everyone.

170
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

171
No, there's a better explanation.

172
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

173
...adult film class.

174
I like that. But no!

175
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

176
I don't know.

177
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

178
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

179
All right.

180
But it better make me look really good.

181
And another thing:

182
The video camera?

183
Nice!

184
Ross?

185
May I have a word?

186
Of course, Donald.

187
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

188
- What?
- Threatening letters...

189
...refusal to meet deadlines.

190
Apparently people now call you Mental.

191
Yeah.

192
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.

193
Oh, no. Uh, you...

194
You don't understand. This is so silly.

195
Um, this is all just
because of a sandwich.

196
A sandwich?

197
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

198
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

199
I call it "The Moistmaker."

200
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge...

201
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?

202
I'm sorry.

203
I believe I ate that.

204
You ate my sandwich?

205
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

206
Oh, really?

207
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

208
No, I...

209
Do you, perhaps, remember...

210
...seeing a note on top of it?

211
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

212
That said it was...

213
...my sandwich!

214
Now calm down.

215
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

216
What?

217
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

218
You threw my sandwich away?

219
My sandwich?

220
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
What's this book about?

222
You didn't read it, either?

223
I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally
read something else.

224
- What?
- Vogue.

225
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

226
No, read it yourself.

227
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

228
Fine.

229
All right. So Jane Eyre?

230
First you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

231
She's a cyborg.

232
A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?

233
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

234
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

235
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

236
Um, Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

237
Go ahead, Rachel.

238
Um, thank you, Phoebe.

239
What struck me most
when reading Jane Eyre...

240
...was, uh, how the book was
so ahead of its time.

241
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

242
Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.

243
- Hey.
- Hey.

244
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

245
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

246
You're naked!

247
I know!

248
Ross?

249
Hey, Chandler.

250
Monica!

251
Are you okay?

252
I'm fine.

253
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

254
Why?

255
On account of my rage.

256
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

257
He gave me a pill for it.

258
A pill?

259
Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

260
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

261
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

262
And I thought it was a good idea.

263
So I took it.

264
They're making you take time off work?

265
And you're okay with that?

266
I don't know.

267
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

268
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

269
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

270
I'm sorry.

271
It was so funny when you compared
Jane Eyre to Robocop.

272
That was not funny!

273
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

274
Come on! What is the big deal?

275
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

276
I thought it would be fun.

277
Fun is good.

278
But I also wanted to learn.

279
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

280
Oh.

281
So you really wanted to learn.

282
You know, Pheebs,
I just wanted to have fun.

283
You know who should go?

284
I know! I know! I know!

285
Monica, you asked the question.

286
Oh, yeah.

287
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

288
Oh, no, no, no!

289
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

290
What's going on?

291
Joey has got a secret peephole!

292
Oh, no, no, no, no!

293
He has a naked picture of Monica!

294
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

295
- Look.
- Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

296
Give me that!

297
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

298
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

299
I am not a pervert, okay?

300
It's just...

301
I just kind of...

302
I think I can explain this.

303
Thank you.

304
Joey's a sex addict.

305
What? No, I'm not!

306
It's okay! It's good!

307
It's a disease.

308
I am not a sex addict!

309
Yes, you are!

310
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

311
No, it isn't. It's not.

312
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

313
What is the truth?

314
- What's up?
- What's going on?

315
I slept with Monica.

316
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

317
Oh, no.

318
You slept with my sister?

319
Uh, yes, but it was...

320
We just did it once, uh, in London.

321
This is not good for my rage.

322
Monica.

323
Is this true?

324
Of course, it's true.

325
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

326
Yes, it's true.

327
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

328
Uh... Oh!

329
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

330
Right, Monica?

331
I guess I wanted to keep it...

332
...as a souvenir.

333
My God, Monica!

334
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

335
No!

336
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

337
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

338
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

339
That makes sense.

340
And the video camera?

341
Uh, Monica?

342
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

343
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

344
Unbelievable!

345
You really kept Joey's underwear?

346
Why? Why would you do that?

347
I'm Monica.

348
I'm disgusting.

349
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

350
Well...

351
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

352
Huh?

353
All right.

354
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

355
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

356
You were making a good point.

357
I mean, till you got cut off.

358
What's up with that girl Monica?

359
I don't know. I didn't come with her.

360
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

361
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.

362
Test?

363
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

364
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!

﻿1
Okay, this is it.

2
You sure you wanna do this?

3
Hello, Mrs. Ross. Woo-hoo!

4
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

5
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

6
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

7
Okay! Okay!

8
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

9
- Agh.
- No running in the chapel.

10
Hey, don't you give me
any of your... Hey!

11
- Hi.
- Hey!

12
What are you doing here?

13
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

14
- Isn't that why you guys are here?
- Yes.

15
- Why else would we be here?
- Ha-ha-ha.

16
Well, what happened? Did we miss it?

17
We actually missed it.

18
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

19
This is insane.

20
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

21
What?

22
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

23
What? If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

24
Really?

25
Yeah.

26
Oh, my God.

27
Oh, well.

28
Mm.

29
Why are we in bed together?

30
I don't know.

31
Do you have any clothes on?

32
Yes.

33
- Really?
- No.

34
Ugh...

35
But we didn't have...

36
...sex, did we?

37
I don't remember much about last night.

38
- It was such a blur. Ha, ha.
- Oh.

39
Oh!

40
- I remember laughing. I laughed a lot.
- Uh-huh?

41
Then we didn't have sex.

42
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.

43
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.

44
Tell me about it.

45
- Morning, Pheebs.
- Mm.

46
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

47
Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry.

48
You want my breakfast?

49
Eh, too depressed to eat.

50
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.

51
So I guess I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

52
- What about my cab?
- I don't need that anymore.

53
No, you borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

54
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

55
Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?

56
- I don't know, it's a long trip.
- That would be great.

57
We could talk and play games.

58
This could be our chance to,
like, renew our friendship.

59
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

60
Sure?

61
Heh. All right, although I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

62
- Hey.
- Hey.

63
- Hey.
- Hey.

64
So has anybody talked
to Dr. And Mrs. Geller yet?

65
Mm-hm. They left me a message.
They'll be here.

66
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

67
It's a buffet, man.

68
Here's where I win all my money back!

69
I gotta talk to you.

70
Sure.

71
What's up?

72
Monica and I almost got married.

73
My God!

74
That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.

75
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

76
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

77
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...

78
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel...

79
...was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

80
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

81
Oh!

82
Tell her she's not marriage material.

83
What?

84
Girls say it to me all the time.

85
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

86
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

87
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

88
- Well, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

89
Good. I was just testing you.

90
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

91
We were just talking about bacon.

92
No, we were talking about tennis.

93
Tennis is more believable.

94
Hey.

95
- Hi.
- Thank you.

96
- Coffee. Heh.
- Mm.

97
- What?
- Are we gonna talk...

98
...about what you guys did last night,
or?

99
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing, uh, happened last night.

100
Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.

101
Rach, we weren't gonna miss
our friends marrying.

102
Huh, who got married?

103
You did?

104
- What?
- Heh.

105
- Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married.
- No, we didn't. That's ridi...

106
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

107
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

108
They let you get married.

109
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

110
Heh, I'm drunk right now.

111
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

112
What are you gonna do?

113
- Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

114
Well, I think,
I think Ross already has one.

115
Now, this one's free, right?

116
Because you paid for the first two,
third one free.

117
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

118
...because we don't need to get divorced.

119
- We're just gonna get an annulment.
- An annulment?

120
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

121
Oh, that's your thing!

122
What?

123
Your thing, that you're the guy
who gets divorced.

124
Oh, yeah.

125
No, no, that's not "my thing."

126
I do not love getting divorced.

127
Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.

128
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it...

129
...and then it won't work out, so you're
gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.

130
Ha-ha-ha.

131
I'm so drunk.

132
- So, what should we do?
- I don't know.

133
I know I love you.

134
- I know I love you.
- Heh.

135
Where are we on the whole
"going back...

136
...to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

137
That's a good question.

138
Last night we let the dice decide.

139
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

140
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

141
Okay? So say, uh...

142
You roll another eight, then there's a sign
that we should get married.

143
All right. Eight we get married...

144
...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12, we don't get married.

145
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

146
Hey, we got a shooter.

147
Money, please.

148
- Ready?
- Ready.

149
Come on, eight.

150
Yes, yes, eight.

151
Eight, easy eight.

152
- Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight.
- That was so unlikely.

153
- Well, let's get married. I guess.
- Aah.

154
That wasn't hard.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

155
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

156
- Agh! Aah!
- Unh, I wanted it so bad!

157
- Wanna go pack?
- Yeah.

158
- We're doing the right thing, right?
- Oh, of course we are.

159
Heh, we left it up to fate.

160
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

161
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
Use them wisely.

162
Come on, Joey.
You can't win if you don't ask any...

163
...questions!

164
Aah! Aah.

165
- What?
- You promised me a fun road trip.

166
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.

167
We are switching,
and you are going to drive back.

168
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper.

169
All right. All right.

170
Yeah. And until then,
you are going to sing to me.

171
Because the radio's broken, and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

172
- Really?
- Sing!

173
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

174
Man, this is a long drive.

175
Are my eyes open?

176
No!

177
- Morning.
- Aah!

178
- Hey.
- Hey, hubby. Heh.

179
Yeah. Actually, um,
I wanted to talk to you...

180
...about that whole annulment thing.
- Uh-huh?

181
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

182
- Okay.
- Heh.

183
So we'll just stay married.

184
Yes, exactly.

185
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

186
Wow, this is so amazing.

187
I, uh, really thought I'd have
to talk you into this more.

188
Ha, ha. Now I'm scared because
I don't actually think you're kidding.

189
I'm not kidding.

190
Look, I... I... Heh.

191
I can't have three failed marriages.

192
I can't, okay?

193
I am not gonna be that guy.

194
So, what, we just stay married forever?

195
Okay, how...?

196
How is this going to affect you, really?

197
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while...

198
...instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs."

199
It's right next to it.

200
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

201
We can stay married...

202
...because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

203
All right. Look, just...

204
...please take a moment here...

205
...and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

206
I am asking you to do me a favor.

207
You are asking me to be your wife.

208
And, as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

209
That kid kicked me really hard.

210
Well, you did pull his hair.

211
- He took my snack.
- I'm not getting into this again.

212
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

213
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

214
There. There. Okay.

215
- This doesn't mean anything, does it?
- No.

216
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

217
He could be a rape... He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

218
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

219
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

220
- And, you, are you a rapist?
- No.

221
Do you like car games?

222
Yeah, you know the, uh,
license plate game?

223
I love the license plate game!

224
Ooh, I'll play. I'll play.

225
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night. Shh.

226
- Hey.
- Hey.

227
Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...

228
...but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

229
Uh...

230
We register...

231
...and you get to keep all the presents.

232
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

233
I've thought about how to tell you this,
and, um, the bottom line, Ross...

234
...is we cannot stay married.

235
- I don't know if that's true...
- Oh, but it is.

236
Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?

237
This is a difference of opinion.

238
- When that happens in a marriage...
- Oh, Ross, come on!

239
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

240
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

241
All right. All right, I'll do it.

242
Thank you.

243
Hey, hey, um...

244
...uh, is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

245
There's the train station, where I get off.

246
Well, I have your address
and phone number.

247
And I have your name
and the fact that you're a drifter.

248
So ball's pretty much in your court.

249
All right. See you, Pheebs.

250
Come on, Pheebs,
I can't take this anymore.

251
Please talk to me.

252
Let me make it up to you, huh?

253
Ground control to Major Tom

254
Commencing countdown
Engines on

255
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on

256
Pssh, this is...

257
Stop it! Stop it! No.

258
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

259
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.

260
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

261
...and I didn't deliver, okay?

262
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

263
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

264
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

265
Thank you.

266
So can we play 20 Questions now?

267
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

268
Okay.

269
Is it...

270
...a kind of hot sandwich?

271
Yes.

272
Is it a meatball sub?

273
That is incredible!

274
You are the master!

275
Aah! Bug!

276
- Ah! That's funny. You look like you're...
- Don't say it!

277
Don't even think it.

278
All right.

279
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

280
Should we just get married?

281
All the signs are telling us to do it.

282
I'm sick of the signs.

283
- I'm happy the way things are.
- Me too.

284
- I don't want change, do you?
- No.

285
All right then, nothing changes.
Everything stays the same!

286
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it's driving me insane!

287
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar...
Aah, agh.

288
You know, I was thinking, what if I, uh...

289
...unpack here?

290
All your stuff would be here.

291
Well...

292
What if all my stuff was here?

293
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

294
Doesn't make any sense.

295
Okay.

296
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

297
Live together?

298
There've been no signs for that.

299
Me asking is kind of a sign.

300
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Okay!

301
Yes.

302
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

303
- Okay.
- Here's your key. Here's your key.

304
Now go out and christen it!

305
Go out and come back in!

306
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

307
- Ready?
- Ready!

308
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

309
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

310
- This isn't a sign!
- No, it's a very old key!

311
- It's an old key!
- Oh, my God, it's old.

312
I love you.

313
I love you.

314
Are you hugging the door right now?

315
No.

316
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

317
Hey.

318
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

319
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

320
Ross, thank you.

321
Do you wanna go see a movie?

322
- Yeah, why not?
- Pheebs?

323
Thanks, I've already seen one.

324
- Okay, um, I'm gonna get my sweater.
- Okay.

325
You wanna hear something weird?

326
Always.

327
I didn't get the annulment.

328
- What?
- We're still married.

329
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

330
What are you doing?

331
Key is stuck in the lock.

332
I can fix it. Hold on.

333
Watch out, watch out.

334
It still doesn't work.

335
- I'm not finished.
- Oh.

336
Nice job, Joe.
You are quite the craftsman.

﻿1
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

2
I remember when people used big ones.

That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

6
Did someone get her
drunk again, or?

7
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

8
It's about being with loved ones.

9
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

10
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

11
Oh, here.

12
See, now it feels like Christmas.

13
And that's the story of the dreidel.

14
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians...

15
...who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

16
...symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

17
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

18
So around the same time
that you started telling this story.

19
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. What's up?

20
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

21
Everywhere I look she's like...

22
I can see why that's hard to resist.

23
I like her so much.

24
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

25
I know. And she's so sweet.

26
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

27
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

28
I am so over Janine.

29
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

30
- Hey, guys.
- Janine!

31
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

32
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

33
Hold it.

34
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

35
Yeah, that's what I said.

36
Oh, my God, we love that show!

37
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

38
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

39
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

40
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

41
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

42
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

43
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why...

44
Well, how it works is...

45
...the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

46
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

47
Not a lot of people know that.

48
Do you guys want to come too?

49
- Are you serious?
- We are there!

50
What are you laughing at?

51
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

52
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

53
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

54
Bye, Janine.

55
Did she just ask me out on a date?

56
I don't think so.

57
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

58
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

59
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

60
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

61
It's a New Year's Eve party.

62
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

63
If she says, "What are you doing?"

64
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

65
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

66
...and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

67
It was a dry day.

68
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

69
Oh, my God!

70
Okay, I've been on sets before...

71
...so let me give you some advice.

72
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

73
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

74
- Got it.
- Okay.

75
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

76
Everyone! Gather up!

77
- Excuse us!
- Excuse us!

78
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

79
...we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

80
Uh, yeah, I have a question.
Uh, when is this gonna air?

81
Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance
over there...

82
...you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

83
- And everyone else, spread out.
- Ross.

84
So when is it gonna air?

85
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

86
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

87
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

88
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

89
That's terrible.

90
No, we do it every year.

91
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

92
Yeah, we never find them.

93
She's always bested us,
that wily... minx.

94
We'll search here for an hour...

95
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

96
- You can't look for Monica's presents.
- We have to.

97
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

98
Well, then you should look with us.

99
Why?

100
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

101
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

102
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

103
What if she gets you
a great present...

104
...two mediums
and lots of little ones...

105
...and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

106
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

107
- If I help, we can find them faster!
- Right!

108
Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!

109
- Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
- Yeah.

110
- Aw!
- Ooh! Who's it for?

111
"Dear Losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

112
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

113
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

114
We are so gonna find them this year.

115
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

116
Yeah.

117
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

118
...and look under my gym bag
or anything?

119
- No. Never do that.
- No.

120
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

121
Okay, that did not just happen.

122
Here comes a camera.

123
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

124
- Why do they keep doing that?
- Ugh!

125
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

126
They've been taping them all day.

127
Right.

128
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

129
We learned how to dance.

130
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

131
Yeah!

132
- Hey, you're a good dancer.
- Really?

133
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

134
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

135
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

136
Uh-huh.

137
You're dancing with her.

138
- We're together.
- Yeah, we came together.

139
I don't see it.

140
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!

141
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.

142
Really, you think so? I don't.

143
I couldn't find anything...
Hey, wait!

144
Yeah, we found them.

145
They were in the guest room closet.

146
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

147
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

148
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

149
Chandler, what is this very weird, um,
metal A-Z thing?

150
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

151
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

152
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

153
Yes, okay.

154
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

155
...you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

156
Hey, dancing girl?

157
Can I go to the bathroom?

158
Here we go. Yeah.

159
Looking good, Gellers!

160
We know!

161
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

162
- We should go dance by him.
- Okay.

163
Okay, everybody, hold!

164
Next on the platforms are...

165
- You two! And...
- Yes!

166
- You two!
- Cool!

167
Excuse me? Sir?

168
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

169
Would it?

170
Hey, Tall Guy!

171
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

172
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

173
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

174
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

175
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

176
I'm trying to win her over. I...

177
I don't think so.

178
You can dance with my partner.

179
She's real mellow.

180
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

181
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe...

182
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

183
All right. Hey.

184
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

185
Hey! Oh, no.

186
Are you in second grade?

187
Hey, man. You're the one
who wet his pants.

188
Hey!

189
Man, this sucks.

190
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

191
...then who's gonna be
the losers then?

192
- I know what'll get us up on a platform.
- What?

193
The routine!

194
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

195
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

196
...he'll want to build us
our own platform.

197
Was it that good?

198
We got honorable mention in the
brother-sister dance category!

199
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

200
Okay, let's do it.

201
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

202
Five, six, seven, eight!

203
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

204
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

205
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

206
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

207
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

208
When we start,
it'll be the countdown...

209
...so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

210
Hey, guy!

211
You got three seconds to get away.

212
What's going on here?

213
Take a look at the guy's pants!

214
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

215
What's the matter with you? Go!

216
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

217
Can you believe this?

218
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

219
I know!

220
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

221
No.

222
Me too!

223
When the music starts...

224
...I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

225
Ross? We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

226
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

227
- Ten.
- Nine, eight, seven.

228
Okay, it all comes down to this.

229
Whatever happens, happens.

230
Destiny.

231
Three, two, one!

232
- Cut!
- No!

233
- Year!

234
Happy No Year!

235
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

236
Hey, look who I found.

237
Oh, hi, guys!

238
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

239
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

240
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

241
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

242
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

243
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

244
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

245
Hmm. How about my "az"?

246
- Hey. This is hollow.
- What?

247
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

248
- Oh, the presents!
- Don't look directly at them!

249
What?

250
All right, no, we could look at them.

251
This one's for me!

252
This one's for Chandler. Here.

253
- And the big one's for me!
- Oh, let's open them!

254
- Wait a minute. We can't do this.
- Why?

255
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

256
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

257
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

258
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.

259
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

260
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

261
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

262
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

263
So, please, please, can we just?
Can we put them back?

264
- Will you get us better gifts?
- Fine.

265
Hey, guys.

266
You found the presents?

267
You let them find the presents?

268
Great.

269
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

270
- That's what you got me?
- Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

271
Home sweet home, huh?

272
Nice to, uh, get back to reality.

273
Plus, we, uh, know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

274
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

275
Anyway, good night.

276
- Joey?
- Yeah?

277
Three...

278
...two, one.

279
Happy New Year.

280
What was that for?

281
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

282
...I was really, really disappointed,
and I just...

283
I just really wanted to kiss you.

284
Really?

285
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

286
- In the moment.
- But only in the moment.

287
So do you, uh, want to kiss again?

288
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

289
Can you wait?

290
No.

291
Me neither.

292
Three, two...

293
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

294
Oh. Okay.

295
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

296
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

297
...and the guy yells "cut!"

298
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

299
...the routine from eighth grade?

300
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

301
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

302
There's no way you could've
done the end...

303
...the way you guys did it back then.

304
What? We could do it.

305
I don't know. You were a lot bigger...
I mean, stronger back then.

306
I can do it, okay?

307
Come on, let's go! Come on.

308
One, two, three, four...

309
...five, six, seven, eight.

310
- I can't do it!
- Ahh!

311
Now, you do that, you're on TV.

﻿1
Hey.

2
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
Listen, uh...

4
You think I have a chance with Janine?

5
Ugh, we've been through this.

6
Don't do this to yourself.

7
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

8
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited about the fact...

9
...that I just kissed her!

10
- Are you serious?
- That's great!

11
Yeah, well, we'll see.

12
You kissed her?

13
Oh, we kissed it up real nice.

14
So you kissed. Then what happened?

15
I came over here to tell you guys.

16
So she's waiting over
there for you?

17
Yeah.

18
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

19
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

20
Okay.

21
- Okay, now I'm really leaving.
- All right.

22
But can you just...

23
...just leave your lips?

24
- Bye.
- Bye.

25
Have you kissed her yet?

26
It's awesome!

27
I could do it forever.

28
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

29
- I'm so glad you said "cooks."
- Right?

30
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

31
We still get your bills and stuff.

32
Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

33
I'm not your garbage man.

34
I'm your mailman.

35
Monica, look.

36
Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!

37
- You got it from Pottery Barn?
- Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

38
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

39
A pharmacist.

40
A pharmacist.

41
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

42
I hate Pottery Barn too.

43
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

44
You took off your pants
and got under the sheets.

45
I was tired.

46
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

47
She hates mass-produced stuff.

48
She thinks her furniture
should have a story behind it.

49
This has a story behind it.

50
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

51
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

52
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

53
Hey! I made that for her.

54
- You made pottery?
- Yeah.

55
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

56
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

57
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

58
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

59
Ah, I love these little drawers.

60
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.

61
Ah, just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

62
So the farmer says:

63
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

64
I'm so glad you're together.

65
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

66
We're a couple of couples.

67
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

68
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

69
Thanks again, man.

70
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

71
- That'd be great!
- Okay.

72
But at least let us
bring the wine.

73
- You don't have to.
- Ah, I insist.

74
- You'll get the wine, right?
- Yeah.

75
- Okay, good night.
- See you tomorrow.

76
Can't wait.

77
How are we going to get
out of that one?

78
- What?
- I can't handle two nights in a row...

79
...with them.

80
What's wrong with them?

81
They're just a little...

82
...blah!

83
Blah?

84
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

85
She's very loud for such
a small person.

86
Uh, they're my best friends.

87
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

88
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

89
Just not two nights in a row.

90
- Okay?
- I guess.

91
Thank you.

92
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

93
- Hey.
- Hey.

94
Ooh! What a great table!
Where did you get it?

95
Guess.

96
Um, a flea market?

97
Ha, I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

98
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

99
Ah, wow.

100
You can just imagine
that this is where...

101
...they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

102
- You know?
- Ooh, yes.

103
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.

104
Almost.

105
Oh, how much was it?

106
Just only 500 bucks.

107
500 bucks at a flea market?

108
I thought you meant how much was it...

109
...when it was new, back then.

110
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, no.

111
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

112
- A dollar?
- And fifty?

113
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

114
- They gave you the old-time pricing.
- Yeah.

115
Well, what period is it from?

116
Uh, it's from yore.

117
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

118
Yes. Yes, I do.

119
- It's just perfect.
- Oh, good.

120
I bet it has a great story too.

121
Did they tell you
where it's from or...

122
Yes, that I know.
This is from, uh, White Plains.

123
- White Plains.
- Mm-hm.

124
Ooh, it sounds like
such a magical place.

125
- I'm here.
- Hi!

126
Oh, my God!

127
- You like it?
- Oh, my God!

128
It's my new apothecary table!

129
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

130
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

131
I got it at Pottery Barn.

132
I know. I bought the same one.

133
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

134
- I said ours was an original.
- Why?

135
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

136
She hates Pottery Barn?

137
She says it's all mass-produced...

138
...nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

139
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

140
What? No, no.

141
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

142
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

143
Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!

144
Heh, yeah.

145
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

146
It's not like she hates you.

147
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

148
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

149
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

150
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

151
Huh. You know what's
not one-of-a-kind? A twin!

152
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

153
- Hey, ooh, cool sheet!
- You like it?

154
- You want to know where I got it?
- Sure.

155
At a flea market.

156
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

157
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

158
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

160
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

161
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

162
...but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

163
Thanks. But, uh, it's just
gonna be me tonight.

164
- What happened to Janine?
- She's, uh, really sick.

165
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, she's been in there all day.

166
Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...

167
...phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

168
Monica! Chandler!

169
I'm sorry about tonight.
I don't know if Joey told you...

170
...but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

171
Have a great time, huh?

172
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

173
Oh, no, she really is sick.

174
Then why is she going to a play?

175
Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...

176
...go to a play for a cold."

177
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

178
Uh, she didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

179
I'm so sorry.

180
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

181
Because she, uh, thinks that
you are "blah."

182
And that, uh, you, Monica,
are too loud.

183
What?!

184
What?

185
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

186
She was lying to our faces?

187
I can't believe this.

188
Who is she to judge us?

189
- We couldn't have been nicer to her.
- And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!

190
I know, I know.

191
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

192
I'm sure she said it...

193
...because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

194
And it was our first date.

195
Plus, she's really sick.

196
You said you made that up!

197
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

198
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

199
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

200
- She'll come around, I promise.
- Of course we will.

201
- Come on, we gotta make dinner.
- Okay.

202
I do not like that woman!

203
I can hear you!

204
I am loud!

205
Aw.

206
Isn't it good?

207
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new...

208
...old sheet.

209
Oh, sure.

210
My apothecary table!

211
- What?
- No!

212
- Where did you get this?
- At Pottery Barn, okay?

213
Oh, my God!

214
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

215
Wow. If they've ripped off our table...

216
...ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

217
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

218
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

219
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

220
Ross, calm down.
I'll give you the 80 cents.

221
Okay, one more time.

222
Would you like some orange juice?

223
- Perfect decibel.
- I know!

224
Hey.

225
Uh, what are you guys doing?

226
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

227
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

228
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

229
- What do you say?
- I'd like to...

230
...but I'm not sure if we have the time.

231
Ha, very funny. I don't know
what to do.

232
I really want you to get along.

233
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

234
- We owe you?
- That's right.

235
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

236
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

237
I looked like an idiot.

238
And I was humiliated.

239
And I only made $200.

240
We didn't give you any money.

241
You don't think I know that?

242
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

243
...the Sahara desk...

244
...or the Parker console table.

245
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

246
- I know, I went a little crazy.
- A little?

247
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

248
Look at that!

249
- The ornamental birdcage! Large.
- Ha, ha.

250
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

251
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

252
Fascinating.

253
Another amazing find! Wow.

254
- I bet this has a great story too.
- It does.

255
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

256
Huh, a lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

257
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

258
Well, there's yore.

259
Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.

260
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

261
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

262
- and I think you should...

263
- you should ask Rachel to help.

264
Aw, he doesn't need my help.

265
I think he's ready to get rid
of the... What'd you call it?

266
The, uh, "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

267
Really?

268
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need...

269
Uh, here's 60 bucks.

270
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial, uh, flea market...

271
...and get me some stuff?

272
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

273
- I do want to.
- She does want to.

274
- She does want to.
- Yeah!

275
I guess the flea market
was just better last time.

276
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

277
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

278
Ugh, yeah, you know what?
Don't look at it.

279
- Seriously, don't look at it.
- Look!

280
There's the table
they stole from us.

281
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

282
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and...

283
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

284
No, it's not.

285
Come on, ours is totally different.

286
I mean, we don't have the...
We don't have that lamp.

287
And that screen is on
the other side.

288
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

289
- Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
- No. No.

290
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

291
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

292
- Come on, don't be mad.
- No, but I am mad.

293
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

294
...and it's in my living room...

295
...and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

296
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

297
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

298
I can't! I can't!

299
Unless...

300
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

301
No, I'm not gonna move out!

302
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

303
- Yes! I would so move out.
- Then I don't have a choice.

304
- I have to buy that lamp!
- That's right.

305
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

306
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

307
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say...

308
...I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

309
I guess I was just nervous.

310
- That's understandable.
- Don't worry about it.

311
So we can go out again?

312
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

313
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

314
See, huh?

315
Wasn't that fun?

316
We have got to move.

317
What?

318
I knew it!

319
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

320
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

321
...is you talking about it.

322
"Oh, Chandler...

323
...I just lost myself in the movement."

324
You know, I know you're talking...

325
...but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

326
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

327
All right, enough!

328
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

329
I really think you could take her.

330
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

331
All right. Uh...

332
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

333
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

334
- They said stuff to me too.
- I know, I'll talk to them about it.

335
They mean so much to me.

336
They're like my family, you know?

337
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time...

338
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

339
It can't.

340
I'm very upset.

341
Okay.

342
Would it help if I apologized?

343
Yeah.

344
That'd be very helpful.

345
What did I tell you about the hall?

346
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

347
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

348
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

349
...I would like that too.

350
- Great.
- Now, come on.

351
- I'm glad we worked it out.
- Me too.

352
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

353
- Or I'll hear you.
- That's it, big girl!

354
Wait!

355
You'd better run!

356
Did you hear that?

357
- What am I gonna do?
- I'm sorry, man.

358
- Want to go watch?
- Yeah!

359
- Hey.
- Hey.

360
- How you doing?
- So, uh, did she move out?

361
Pretty much.

362
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

363
When it's not right, you know it.

364
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

365
- You know what'd cheer you up?
- What?

366
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

367
I think you should come.

368
You're right, that did cheer me up.

﻿1
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

2
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

3
They printed it. Yeah.

4
I didn't know they prints jokes.

5
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

6
It's not just about the pictures.

7
It didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

8
Here, check it out. It's the first one too.

9
Right there.

10
Ha, ha.

11
That is funny.

12
It was also funny when I made it up.

13
- What?
- I made that joke up.

14
Uh, oh, oh. No, you didn't. I did.

15
Uh, uh, oh. Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.

16
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

17
What?

18
I'm sorry. I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

19
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

20
- No.
- Seriously?

21
You tell a lot of jokes.

22
Look, it's my joke.

23
But if it makes you feel any better,
they don't print the name.

24
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

25
Yeah, I guess.

26
- Hey, guys.
- Joey, Playboy printed my joke!

27
No, it's mine! It's my joke. Call them!
They'll tell you!

28
- My joke!
- My joke!

29
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30
Jokes? What...?

31
You guys know they have naked chicks
in there, right?

32
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

33
The band Heart is having a really tough
time and they may break up.

34
Let's watch that at your place.

35
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

36
Hey, Chandler.
You know what we should do?

37
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

38
What? No, I want to watch this.

39
- Did your cable go out?
- No. No, that's VH1.

40
I gotta tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...

41
...it's a lot of noise to me.

42
Why is your cable out?

43
Uh... Oh, because I haven't
really paid the bill. Heh, heh.

44
If you need money, would you
please let me loan you some money?

45
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

46
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

47
- Whoa.
- I know, yeah.

48
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

49
And Ross gave me this great book.

50
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch the show at his place?

51
Sure.

52
- Paid your phone bill?
- Not so much.

53
- Hey.
- Oh.

54
It's only you.

55
- What are you doing?
- We are looking at a Playboy.

56
I want to look too!

57
Yikes!

58
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

59
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...

60
...she has lost her clothes.

61
So she rides naked on the horse, she's
crying out, "Where are they? Where are they?"

62
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

63
Oh. Yeah.

64
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...

65
- ...lift up your shirt and bend over?
- Yeah.

66
You see, now, I would date this girl.

67
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

68
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

69
I got a question.

70
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

71
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

72
Rachel.

73
What?

74
I don't know.

75
Me neither.

76
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

77
Yeah.

78
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

79
So you heard it, you repeated it...

80
...so that must mean you wrote it.

81
Oh, you guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say...

82
...I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

83
What?

84
You didn't get it?

85
The doctor is a monkey.

86
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

87
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

88
Your joke?

89
Well, I think the Hef would disagree.

90
Which is why he sent me a check...

91
...for $100.

92
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

93
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

94
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...

95
...that I am a published writer.

96
Well, she'll know that you stole the joke.

97
You gonna follow me down there?

98
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna go now.

99
Okay.

100
- Here you go.
- Oh.

101
Ah.

102
Uh, Gunther?

103
I can't pay for this now,
because I'm not working.

104
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like...

105
...paying for stuff, so...

106
Well, if you want, you can work here.

107
Uh, I don't know.

108
It's just...

109
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

110
And to go from that to this,
it's just...

111
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

112
Okay. But the money's good.

113
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

114
What?

115
Flexible hours.

116
Maybe I could be a waiter.

117
Could I use the phone?

118
She picked Rachel.

119
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

120
He took my joke. He just took it.

121
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

122
Phoebe picking Rachel.

123
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

124
You know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

125
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

126
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

127
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

128
- Picking Rachel.
- That's right.

129
Did you hear something?

130
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain and stealing my thoughts.

131
It's coming from the living room.

132
I finished my book.

133
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

134
Don't you guys look cute.

135
You guys make a cute couple.

136
Monica, what are you doing?

137
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place the other day.

138
Remember?
When you picked Rachel over me?

139
That was funny. Ha, ha, ha.

140
- It was kind of funny.
- It wasn't funny at all!

141
Why would you do that?

142
Why didn't you pick me?

143
Fine.

144
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you...

145
...is just, you know, you're...

146
...high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch.

147
That is completely untrue.

148
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

149
You write out a list,
and we'll go through it point by point.

150
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

151
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more...

152
...flexible and mellow. That's all.

153
Well, people are different.

154
Yeah, Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

155
What? Are you saying, that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

156
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

157
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

158
You're not invited to lunch!

159
What do you think?
I think that's pretty strong.

160
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

161
Pssh.

162
You start working on that list.

163
- I cannot believe her.
- I know. Where do you want to eat?

164
- Oh... Oh, I love that Japanese place.
- I'm sick of Japanese. Not going there.

165
- Wherever you want to go is cool.
- All right.

166
Oh, hey, Gunther...

167
...check this out.

168
Yeah. Man, that Chandler cracks me up.

169
Hey, Ross, you want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

170
- Yeah. I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
- Sure.

171
- Coffee?
- No.

172
Coffee? I'm going up there.

173
- No.
- No, thank you.

174
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

175
I'd love ice water.

176
You got it.

177
Joey, what are you doing?

178
Just being friendly.

179
Joey, you're not supposed to go back there.

180
No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?

181
Don't wink at me.

182
And put on your apron.

183
Okay. Heh, heh.

184
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

185
- Joey, do you work here?
- No.

186
- Waiter.
- Yeah!

187
Joey, what's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

188
Uh...

189
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

190
It's supposed to go
in the other direction.

191
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

192
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

193
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it. Right?

194
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

195
It'll be great.

196
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

197
Why would it be weird?

198
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

199
Okay. It doesn't seem that weird.

200
Seriously, I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

201
See, now it's weird again.

202
I think it's great. You're gonna make
a lot of money. Here's your first tip.

203
Don't eat yellow snow. Ha, ha, ha.

204
15, coffeehouse.

205
This is great. Finally, I have
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

206
Let me tell you some things
I learned working at the coffeehouse.

207
First, the customer is always right.

208
A smile goes a long way.

209
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

210
Thanks, Rach.

211
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

212
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers, huh?

213
It's all about turnover.

214
Joey.

215
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

216
I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it right now.

217
And since you wait,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

218
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

219
Okay.

220
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

221
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

222
But you know what we decided you are?

223
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

224
Ha!

225
That's true, I am flaky.

226
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

227
Yeah, totally.

228
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

229
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

230
That's great. Good for you guys.

231
- I am not high maintenance!
- I am not a pushover!

232
- Who said you were?
- You did!

233
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

234
Hey, Gunther.

235
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

236
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

237
Really? I like your natural color.

238
It's a great part. Check it out.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

239
I wait for him in this bar and save his seat.
Listen.

240
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."

241
- That's the whole part?
- Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but...

242
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.

243
Oh, man.

244
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."

245
- Excuse me.
- No, I didn't mean you.

246
But you believed me, huh?

247
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

248
So you'd hire me, right?

249
For what?

250
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

251
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

252
What?

253
It's for the kids.

254
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

255
Yeah. It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

256
I'm sure you all read about it.

257
- It's my joke.
- It's my joke.

258
It's my joke.

259
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

260
- No. Let's have Monica decide.
- Yeah.

261
- Hey, Mon!
- Mon, get out here!

262
- Monica?
- Okay.

263
You have to help us decide
whose joke this is.

264
Why do I have to?

265
- You're the only one that can be fair.
- Yeah.

266
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

267
But I'm your brother. We're family.

268
That's the most important thing
in the world.

269
Don't try to sway her.

270
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

271
- Okay, let's go.
- All right.

272
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...

273
...then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

274
Chandler, you go first.

275
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

276
- Did I meet him at Christmas?
- Can I finish my story?

277
Do you want me to pick you?

278
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

279
Two babies.

280
- Continue.
- Okay.

281
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

282
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

283
Are you kidding?

284
Okay, look, I study evolution.

285
Remember? Evolution.

286
Monkey into man.

287
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

288
...I had a monkey.

289
I'm Dr. Monkey!

290
- I'm not arguing with that.
- All right.

291
I've heard enough. I've made my decision.

292
- Oh!
- Okay, so what...? Do tell.

293
You are both idiots.

294
The joke is not funny,
and it's offensive to women.

295
And doctors. And monkeys.

296
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

297
You should be arguing over who gets blamed
for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.

298
Now, let it go.

299
The joke sucks.

300
- It's your joke.
- It is not.

301
- Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
- Hi.

302
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

303
Why don't you tell them...

304
...what you were telling me earlier about me
not being high maintenance.

305
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

306
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

307
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance...

308
...is merely attention to detail...

309
...and...

310
...generosity of spirit.

311
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

312
Really? I've heard better.

313
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them, Chandler.

314
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

315
Look, I am not high maintenance!

316
I am not. Chandler!

317
You're high maintenance.

318
You are on my list!

319
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not...

320
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

321
And that's good.

322
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good...

323
...at making you feel better about that.

324
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...

325
...but it's okay, because I like...

326
...maintaining you.

327
I didn't even tell him to say that.

328
- Aw.
- Okay.

329
- All right, you're off my list.
- I'm off the list.

330
Phoebe?

331
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

332
Because I have the best boyfriend.

333
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

334
How'd the audition go?

335
Oh, not good. No.

336
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so...

337
Wow, that is a bad audition.

338
Well, how did you lose your job here?

339
I had the audition...

340
...but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

341
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

342
He left work in the middle of the day
to do a personal errand...

343
...and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

344
That's not right.

345
What are you gonna do?

346
Joey, you can't let him get away with that.

347
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say something to him...

348
I really shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something to him!

349
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

350
- That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
- Okay.

351
- What?
- He can have his job back.

352
That's right,
he can have his job back.

353
Glad we got that all straightened out.

354
There you go, Joey.

355
- Got your job back.
- That's great. Thanks, Rach.

356
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

357
- Rach, you're in my seat.
- I'm sorry.

358
Hey, I never got to hear who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

359
- I'd pick you, Phoebe.
- Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.

360
Yeah, I kind of thought.

361
Never.
- It would totally be you.

362
Hey.

363
A question: If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...

364
...who would you pick?

365
- No way.
- I'm not answering.

366
Joey.

367
No way, I'm not answering that.

﻿1
Okay, Rach,
that's muffin and espresso, 4.50.

2
Ross, double latte, 2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25.

3
And, Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25.

4
So all together that's 12.75.

5
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

6
- Hi.
- Hi.

7
How much do I owe?

8
Oh, that's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

9
Oh. Great. Well, tell him thanks.

10
And since Joey seems like such a nice guy,
maybe we could go on a date sometime?

11
Well, he's not used to women
being so forward...

12
...but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

13
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

14
Hey, Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?

15
It will be when you look like that
in a tight skirt.

16
This is great.
I'm getting more dates than ever.

17
Wait, you're only giving away free stuff
to the pretty girls?

18
Joey, that is so gross.

19
Hmm. How about a scone
on the house, baby?

20
I'm pretty.

21
- Hey, does anyone have any gum?
- Oh, I do.

22
Here. Sorry.

23
Oh, you know what?

24
No.

25
Wait a second.

26
- I know it's in here somewhere.
- You know what? I'm good. I'm good.

27
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

29
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

30
Aw.

31
- I'm so sorry that you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

32
I don't get sick.

33
Getting sick is for weaklings.
It's for pansies.

34
Honey, no one thinks
that you're a pansy.

35
But we do think that you need a tissue.

36
I have not been sick in over three years.

37
- I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
- I don't need a tissue. I'm fine.

38
When you put a D at the end of "fine,"
you're not fine.

39
I'm fine.

40
You know, it's a really hard word to say.

41
- Yes?
- Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

42
- Oh, my God, Jill.
- Oh, my God, Rachel.

43
Oh!

44
Oh, my God, introduce us.

45
- This is Chandler.
- Hi.

46
And you know Monica and Ross.

47
- Hi.
- And that's Phoebe, and that's Joey.

48
- Hey. How you doing?
- Don't.

49
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- Oh.

50
Which sister is this?

51
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

52
- Daddy cut me off.
- Never mind, I got it.

53
And you know what I said to him?

54
I said, "I'm gonna hire a lawyer,
sue you and take all your money...

55
...and then I'm gonna cut you off."

56
- What did he say?
- He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.

57
Ah.

58
Then he told me to come
and learn the value of money...

59
...from the one daughter he's proud of.

60
Oh.

61
Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me.
My dad's proud of me. Ha, ha.

62
- Rach?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

63
Hey, honey, so, what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?

64
- Okay, I bought a boat.
- You bought a boat?

65
Yeah, but it wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

66
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

67
Jill, I think this is the best thing
that could've ever happened to you.

68
You've needed to get out
on your own anyway.

69
And you know, when I did it,
at first I was scared...

70
...but then look at me now.

71
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

72
Okay, well, this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna get a job.

73
You're gonna get an apartment.
And I'll help you.

74
You can stay with us.
Right? She can stay with us?

75
- Of course, yeah.
- Oh, that's so great.

76
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you guys.

77
Aw. I like cars.

78
- You all finished here?
- Yes.

79
Great.

80
- Okay, here are the tips for this morning.
- Mm.

81
Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes $8.

82
- What?
- For all the free food you gave away.

83
Well, if it's free food,
how come you're charging me for it?

84
We don't give anything away
unless it's someone's birthday.

85
Oh. What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

86
- No.
- Oh. Sorry.

87
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

88
Jill, how did you pay for all this?
I thought your dad took your credit card.

89
Oh, please,
I memorized those numbers when I was 15.

90
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got.

91
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.

92
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.

93
I don't think charging clothes to your dad
qualifies as making it on your own.

94
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.

95
I don't think Rachel's gonna think
it's a good idea.

96
- So who made her queen of the world?
- I would love that job.

97
- Hey. What's going on?
- Hey.

98
Jill.

99
Did you shop?

100
No.

101
They did.

102
- Yeah, we went shopping.
- Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah.

103
You went shopping?

104
Then you came in here
and paraded it right under Jill's nose...

105
...when you know she's trying to quit.

106
Wow. You guys, that's terrible.

107
- Sorry, Jill.
- Sorry, Jill.

108
It's okay.

109
- So, what did you get?
- Oh, well, all right. I got... Thank you.

110
I got, um, this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

111
Oh.

112
And then I got, uh...
These are apartment pants.

113
Apartment pants?

114
Yeah, you've never heard of them?

115
No, of course.
Of course I've heard of them.

116
- Ross, what did you get?
- Huh?

117
I got this...

118
This.

119
- A pashmina?
- Yeah.

120
Oh, I love these babies.

121
- Really?
Mm-hm.

122
Ross, what's a pashmina?

123
It's a rug.

124
Jill?

125
I'm sorry, Rachel.

126
Oh, come on,
you really think that's gonna work on me?

127
I invented that.

128
Oh, right. But I am sorry.

129
All right, it's okay.
One little setback is okay.

130
- But don't let it happen again, all right?
- Okay.

131
Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff,
I should take it all away.

132
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.

133
And the pants.

134
You know what? I'm just gonna take it all,
because that way, you'll learn the lesson.

135
Alrighty.

136
I'm gonna run a couple of errands,
and I will see you at dinner.

137
She took all my stuff.

138
Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.

139
That's the best one.

140
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
- Oh. Well, hey.

141
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.

142
Oh, yeah?
Well, how about you with the:

143
- "I'm sorry."
- Shut up. I wasn't like that at all.

144
What about what I said, you know,
about the apartment pants?

145
How dumb was I?

146
- Were you this cute in high school?
- Oh, stop.

147
- No, you stop.
- No, you stop.

148
You stop.

149
Okay, why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?

150
Okay, so, what do you wanna do?
Let's do something crazy.

151
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.

152
Okay, I'll rest.

153
But, you know, if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

154
See, that would be impossible to resist
if you weren't all drippy here.

155
Are you saying
that you don't wanna get with this?

156
Yeah, I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

157
Oh. Come on.

158
Don't take this personally, okay?

159
It's just that I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

160
I'm with you, Chandler.

161
I can't have sex with a sick person either.
That's disgusting.

162
But I'm not sick. Let me prove it to you.

163
We are two healthy people
in the prime of life.

164
See, that's the thing.
I would like to stay in...

165
...the prime of life.

166
Hey.

167
- Hey.
- What's up?

168
Um, I think there's something
you should maybe know.

169
It better not be
about the apartment pants...

170
...because I just pitched the idea to
my boss at Ralph Lauren, and she loved it.

171
No, no. It's just, I was, um...

172
I was with Ross and Jill after you left...

173
...and I'm pretty sure
I saw a little spark between them.

174
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, it's probably nothing.

175
But I just wanted to warn you
that there might be something there.

176
- With Ross and Jill?
- Yeah.

177
With Ross and my sister?

178
Yeah.

179
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

180
Yeah.

181
- Oh, there is no way.
- Okay, then.

182
Oh, my God. I cannot believe that.

183
I don't really like it when Ross goes out
with anyone, but my sister?

184
Isn't that like incest or something?

185
Oh, my God, and they're gonna have sex.
Oh, no. What if he marries her too?

186
Oh, this is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

187
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross, you know?

188
And Jill, she should be able
to do whatever it is she wants to do.

189
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.

190
This is just...

191
Oh, my God, this is just the worst thing
that could've ever happened to me.

192
But great news
about the apartment pants, huh?

193
That'll be 3.85.

194
What do you mean?
Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.

195
It's just I can't,
because my manager said that I...

196
Happy birthday to you

197
Happy birthday to you

198
- Happy birthday, dear Annie...
- Amy.

199
Amy

200
Happy birthday to you

201
- Hey.
- Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too.

202
Yeah, not in here it isn't.

203
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

204
Oh, hey. Uh...

205
You know, I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

206
Oh. No. But I just walked past three sales
and I didn't go in.

207
- How strong am I?
- Oh.

208
That is great.

209
Hey, you know
who doesn't have to job-hunt?

210
- Ross. He works at the university.
- Yeah?

211
Oh, so you know that? You guys talked?
So you get along? So you're gonna go out?

212
Me go out with Ross? No. God, no.
What would make you think that?

213
It's just Phoebe...

214
...said she, you know, thought she saw
something between you guys.

215
- No. I mean, he's nice.
- Yeah.

216
He's the kind of guy you're friends with
but not the kind of guy you date.

217
I mean, he's the kind of guy you date,
because you did, but me?

218
Hmm, not so much.

219
Oh, not so much? What do you mean?

220
I mean,
is there something wrong with Ross?

221
Oh, no, no, no. He's just...

222
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

223
- Are you saying he's a geek?
- You think so too?

224
No. No. Ross is not a geek.

225
Fine. Then let's just say he's not my type.

226
What, handsome is not your type?

227
Smart, kind, good kisser?
What, those things aren't on your list?

228
Ross is a great guy.
You would be lucky to be with him.

229
Well, okay, if it means that much to you,
I'll ask him out.

230
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I was just...

231
You know what, Rachel? You're right.
You know, he has been really nice to me.

232
Yeah, but he's not your type.

233
But maybe that's a good thing.

234
You know,
I'm doing all these different things.

235
Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.

236
Yeah, but you don't, you know...
You don't wanna try too much too fast.

237
I mean, you do remember what happened
to the little girl...

238
...who tried too much too fast,
don't you?

239
What?

240
She died, Jill.

241
Chandler.

242
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

243
Oh. Oh.

244
Calling Dr. Big. Dr. Big to the bed.

245
Oh, jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

246
How could I be asleep
knowing that you were in the next room?

247
I was asleep.

248
Oh, no, no, no, honey.
You know what's sexy? Layers.

249
Layers are sexy.

250
And blankets are sexy.
And, oh, hot water bottles are sexy.

251
Come on, get into bed.
I wanna prove that I'm not sick.

252
I wanna make you feel as good as I feel.

253
- Would you please get some rest?
- I'm fine.

254
Happy birthday to you

255
- You're paying for that.
- What? No, no, it's her birthday.

256
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 different women today.

257
- But it...
- You are no longer authorized...

258
...to distribute birthday muffins.

259
Damn it.

260
Rach.

261
- Hi.
- Hi. Ahem.

262
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?

263
- Well, yeah.
- Oh, wow. I mean, wow.

264
I think she's cute...

265
...but I never would've thought
of going out with her. Never.

266
- Really?
- Yeah.

267
But after you said it was okay,
I figured, why not?

268
Oh, so not really "never." Heh.

269
I have to say,
you are a much bigger person than I am.

270
I mean, after all we've been through.
I just...

271
You know what?
I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.

272
Aw.

273
Hey, if you ever wanna go out with Monica,
you have my blessing.

274
And mine.

275
Chandler?

276
I think I'm sick.

277
Really?

278
Struck down in the...

279
...prime of life.

280
Okay, fine, I admit it. I feel terrible.

281
- Will you please rub this on my chest?
- Okay.

282
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

283
- Come on, I really need your help here.
- No, no, no.

284
- Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
- Okay.

285
So you're just kind of rubbing it
on yourself?

286
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

287
Are you kidding me?
Is this turning you on?

288
Yes.

289
I can't believe it.
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

290
It's all very, very good.

291
So you wanna go, uh...

292
...mix it up?

293
- Not now, I'm sick.
- Oh, come on, you big faker.

294
What about your rule
about never sleeping with sick people?

295
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

296
- Okay, if you really wanna have sex.
- Okay.

297
Worked like a charm.

298
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
What are you doing here?

300
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

301
I don't like it.

302
- Really?
- It's kind of slutty.

303
It's yours.

304
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

305
Me too.

306
- Hi, Jill.
- Hey.

307
Hi...

308
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

309
Heh. You're not at home,
you're right here.

310
Yeah, I know.

311
And I bet you thought it would be weird.
But it's not.

312
Okay.

313
So, well, I'll, um...

314
I'll have her home by midnight. Ha, ha.

315
Why aren't you home yet?

316
Is someone there?

317
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

318
What are you doing here?

319
Uh, I'm just looking out your window
at the view.

320
What are you guys doing?

321
We got some VapoRub in some places.

322
Oh. He brought her back
to his apartment.

323
Who?

324
Is that your sister?

325
Ugh. She is a slut.

326
God. Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

327
Oh, my God, look,
he's taking off her clothes.

328
He's taking off her coat.

329
Oh, this is just terrible.

330
Oh, no, it's not. It was the first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...

331
Hoo-hoo. He's gonna get some.

332
Of the glare...

333
...from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

334
You know,
so, um, he's closed the drapes there...

335
...so he can have a nice pleasant
conversation with your little sister.

336
Well, I'm off to bed.

﻿1
Oh. Uh, hey, Rach.
I was just coming over here to, uh...

2
Oh, wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.

3
I'm eating their food.
What are you doing?

4
Ross is on a date with my sister.

5
They shut the drapes
two and a half hours ago.

6
Whoa, I didn't know
we could date your sister.

7
Joey, we know you steal our food.

8
I'm good.

9
Oh, are the drapes still closed?

10
Yeah. Who should've shut their drapes
is that perverted couple two doors over.

11
- Is that a swing?
- Oh, don't even ask.

12
Yuck.

13
I can't believe Ross is going out
with Rachel's sister.

14
When Chandler made out with my sister,
I was mad at him for 10 years.

15
- That was like five years ago.
- Yeah, you got five years left.

16
- Joey...
- You wanna make it six?

17
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

18
Hey.

19
Can I get a cup of coffee?

20
So how was your big date last night?

21
Uh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.

22
- It was fun?
- Yeah.

23
Great.

24
So, uh... So did you guys hit it off?

25
- I guess so.
- So, uh... So did anything happen?

26
Because rumor has it
you guys shut the drapes. Heh.

27
No, no, nothing happened.

28
I shut the drapes to show her slides
of my favorite fossils.

29
Oh, slides. Ha, ha.

30
So really nothing happened.

31
Something could've happened, all right?
She really dug my slides.

32
- Mm.
- And she was definitely giving me the vibe.

33
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

34
Anyway...

35
If she wasn't into me,
why would she ask me out again?

36
- She asked you out again?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

37
- Tomorrow night.
- Hmm.

38
Valentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.

39
Who knows what could happen?

40
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides, if you know what...

41
Okay, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

42
I can't...
I can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.

43
I just can't. It's just too weird, all right?

44
I imagine the two of you together,
I freak out.

45
- It just freaks me out, and I can't do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. No... Yes. It's okay.

46
It's okay.

47
Hey, it's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

48
- Thank you. I... Yeah.
- I mean, after tomorrow night.

49
No, no, no. Please, Ross. I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out.

50
Okay, okay, okay.

51
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

52
Ross, thanks.

53
- You want me to call her right now?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

54
I mean, come on, that's craz...
I mean, that's crazy.

55
So, what's going on with you?
What is going on with you?

56
Well, um... Oh.

57
- I may teach another class this semester.
- Yeah, do it now. Call her right now.

58
- This is my favorite part.
- Yeah, me too.

59
Oh, you know what's sadder than this?
Bambi.

60
I cried for three days with that movie.
No, wait, two.

61
Because on the third day, my mother killed
herself, so I was partly crying for that.

62
Well, see, now, that I can see crying over,
but Bambi is a cartoon.

63
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

64
Yes, it was very sad
when the guy stopped drawing the deer.

65
There's nothing wrong with crying.
You don't have to be so macho all the time.

66
I'm not macho.

67
Yeah, you're right.

68
I don't know what I was thinking.

69
I guess I just never really cried, you know?
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

70
Come on, man, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up.

71
Like, uh...

72
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?

73
I'd be sad, sure, but I wouldn't cry.

74
Okay, what if the puppy said,
"Help me, Chandler.

75
All the other puppies pick on me."

76
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich.

77
Oh. I've got it. I have got it.
Pictures from your childhood.

78
This will get you going good.

79
- All right, what's going on there?
- Oh, that's Parents' Day, first grade.

80
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

81
- Where are your parents?
- Oh, they didn't wanna come.

82
- Oh, Chandler.
- You poor thing.

83
So that story doesn't make you cry?

84
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?

85
No. It's not okay. It's not okay at all.

86
You're dead inside.

87
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

88
- Are you Phoebe Buffay?
- Yeah.

89
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

90
Oh, you're my biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you. Hi. Ha, ha.

91
- Sure, yeah.
- Wow.

92
Wow, thanks a lot.

93
I just wanna say
I think you're really talented.

94
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

95
Joey, listen, take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

96
Bye.

97
So you saw me
on Days of Our Lives, huh?

98
You want me to do a little
Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?

99
I have no idea what you're talking about.

100
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.

101
- Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.
- Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.

102
- Movies?
- That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

103
- I don't think so.
- No, no, it was.

104
She was in Sex Toy Story 2...

105
...Lawrence of a Labia.

106
And I got her autograph.

107
The guys at the comic-book store
aren't gonna believe this.

108
Gunther.

109
Hey, don't let that guy in here anymore.
He just said Phoebe's a porn star.

110
Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
but she's really good.

111
You should check out
Inspect Her Gadget.

112
- Hey.
- Hey.

113
You'll never believe what just happened.

114
Ross totally blew me off
and didn't even tell me why.

115
Oh, well. You know what, honey?

116
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone else.

117
Oh. Oh, there is this great guy
you will just love at work named Bob.

118
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

119
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

120
Not random. Bob.

121
It's probably because
I'm not mature enough or smart enough.

122
Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.

123
Pfft. No, that can't be it.
It's really gotta be the smart thing. Ugh.

124
I'm so stupid.

125
I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty,
stupid girl.

126
No, honey.

127
Okay.

128
Okay. You wanna know why Ross
canceled the date?

129
Because I asked him to.

130
- You asked him to?
Mm-hm.

131
- Why?
- Because you are my sister...

132
...and Ross and I have this huge history.

133
- You wanna go out with Ross?
- No.

134
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to have him?

135
- You know, Bob in Human Resources...
- Ugh.

136
I cannot believe you did this to me.
You had me doubting how smart I was.

137
You had me doubting my fashion sense.

138
This is not that big a deal.
Just don't date Ross.

139
- There's a million other guys out there.
- You have no right to tell me what to do.

140
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do.

141
- Why are you always so jealous of me?
- This is not about me being jealous of you.

142
This is about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

143
Can't have?

144
Excuse me,
the only thing I can't have is dairy.

145
All right, all right.
You just blew your chances at dating Bob.

146
- Who?
- In Human Resources!

147
I am jealous of her?

148
I mean, who does she think she is,
Princess Caroline?

149
- You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
- Do I have my own castle?

150
Hey. Phoebe's not here, is she?

151
- No.
- Oh, great, did you get a movie?

152
Uh...

153
Yeah. Yeah.

154
But, uh, I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna like.

155
You didn't get more that are gonna have us
reaching for the tissues all night, did you?

156
Sort of.

157
Guys, what's going on?

158
Phoebe's a porn star.

159
- What?
- Yeah.

160
- What are you talking about?
- Where?

161
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay the Vampire Layer."

162
- Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
- That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?

163
Down at the adult video place
on Bleecker.

164
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him...

165
...to surprise him.

166
And then... Ha, ha. Then I pretended
that I didn't know he was in there.

167
Wow. I mean, I just can't...
I can't believe this.

168
You know?
I mean, you think you know someone.

169
Even Phoebe, who's always been
somewhat of a question mark.

170
Hmm.

171
This is so bizarre.

172
I guess it kind of makes sense, though.
She had such a terrible childhood.

173
Hey, I had a terrible childhood
and I don't do porn.

174
- Yes, but you're dead inside.
- Ah.

175
- All right, well, I'd better take that back.
- What? Why? Why?

176
We can't watch that.
I mean, that's Phoebe.

177
- You're right. We shouldn't watch this.
- Absolutely not. That goes back.

178
- But, you know, maybe a little bit.
- How about just the first half?

179
Hey, no, this is wrong, you guys.
Phoebe's our friend.

180
- I'm not gonna watch it.
- Yeah.

181
- Good for you, Joe.
- Yeah.

182
Ah. I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.

183
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake
into my dark places?

184
Actually, I was kind of hoping
it would be the other way around.

185
- Hold on, what is that on her ankle?
- Her ankle is what you're watching?

186
- Well, it's hard to tell.
- Ooh.

187
Oh, God, if she would just stop moving.

188
She's just doing her job.

189
You sick bastards.

190
Oh. It's a tattoo.
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't...

191
Wait, that's Ursula.
That's not Phoebe. That is Ursula.

192
Wait, wait. I can watch that.
Rewind it. Rewind it.

193
- Hey.
- Oh.

194
What's up? Oh, my God.
What am I doing?!

195
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

196
Chicken Soup for the Soul?

197
There's no back to this couch.

198
Why are you reading this?
You hate this kind of stuff.

199
I figured I'd give it a shot.

200
Maybe one of those stories
would make me cry.

201
Then you wouldn't think
I was all dead inside.

202
Aw, that's so sweet.

203
Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.

204
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.

205
- Stop it.
- I mean, come on, seriously. Think about it.

206
We get married, I'm up at the altar,
and I'm like this:

207
I won't care.

208
Because I know that you'll be feeling it
all in here.

209
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

210
And if we have a baby one day...

211
...and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room...

212
...and you don't cry, so what?

213
And if we take him to college
and we come home...

214
...and we see his empty room
for the first time...

215
...and you got nothing?

216
Won't matter to me.

217
Okay.

218
Well, I won't worry
about this anymore, then.

219
Yeah. And, you know, if I die...

220
...from a long illness...

221
...and you're writing out my eulogy...

222
...and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

223
"I will always be with you"...

224
...and you still can't shed one tiny tear...

225
...I know you'll be crying a river inside.

226
- Aw, I love you, sweet...
- What is wrong with you?

227
- What?
- What?

228
You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?

229
I mean, I left you a note from the beyond.

230
- So you didn't mean any of that?
- No, you robot!

231
You damn kids.
You ring my bell one more time, I swear to...

232
Oh, uh, Jill. Um...

233
That's just a little game I play
with the kids down the hall.

234
They've really taken a liking to me.

235
What's the matter?

236
Rachel and I had a really big fight.
Can I come in?

237
I know we're not supposed to see
each other anymore. I'm okay with that.

238
I don't know anybody in the city,
and I need somebody to talk to about it.

239
- Oh, of course. What happened?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

240
Okay. Um...

241
- But you know what might cheer me up?
- What?

242
Seeing some more
of your super-cool slides.

243
- Wow, really?
- Totally. I loved them.

244
And maybe you could finish telling me
about all the different kinds of sand.

245
I'd love to. You wait right here.
I'll go get the projector and my notes.

246
Oh, great. Thanks, Ross.
You're such a good friend.

247
Oh.

248
Hey. Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her anywhere.

249
- No, I haven't.
- Is Ross home?

250
Maybe I'll just call him
and see if he's actually seen her.

251
Who is it?

252
It's Phoebe, "Phoebe."

253
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

254
- So you're making porn movies.
- No, I'm not.

255
We're still rolling.

256
You're making one right now.

257
- Let's go, Phoebe.
- And you're using my name.

258
Yeah, can I help you with something?

259
Phoebe, come on.

260
Look, I'm talking right now.
You're... You mean her. Oh.

261
You know,
twin stuff is always a real big seller.

262
What?

263
Yeah. I could talk them into giving you
like $30.

264
No. No way. No.

265
And stop using my name.
And shame on you.

266
And shame on all of you.
You're disgusting.

267
Especially you, with that.

268
Slides are almost ready.

269
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing.

270
Alcohol.

271
- Okay, well, there's wine in the kitchen.
- Oh, great.

272
Hello?

273
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

274
Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?

275
She's really upset. We're just talking.

276
I think she's trying to make something
happen with you to get back at me.

277
Oh, so that's the only reason
she could be here, huh?

278
It couldn't have anything to do
with the fact that I'm a good listener...

279
...and I put on a great slide show?

280
Ross, I am telling you,
she is using you to get back at me.

281
You know, I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

282
Whoa.

283
Uh, that was your sister, actually.

284
She thinks you're just using me. Heh.

285
So?

286
- Hey.
- Hey.

287
So I just came from the company
Ursula works for.

288
Oh, no, not you too.

289
No, no.
I went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks.

290
There were a lot of them.

291
- Nice.
Mm-hm.

292
And I won't have to
go back there anymore...

293
...because I gave them
my "correct address."

294
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother you
that people think you're a porn star?

295
Oh, no, no. I know how to handle it.

296
- Good.
- Yeah.

297
You're trying to figure out
where you know me from?

298
All right, I'll give you a hint.
From porn. Okay?

299
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

300
- See?
- Yeah.

301
Hey.

302
- You, uh, may have been right about Jill.
- Oh, I knew it. What happened?

303
- Um, she kissed me.
- What? You kissed?

304
- Maybe we should give them some privacy.
- Shh!

305
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

306
It doesn't sound like it.
It's pretty easy not to kiss someone.

307
You just don't kiss them.
See? Look at us right now, not kissing.

308
Let me finish, okay?

309
She started kissing me,
and I didn't stop it.

310
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

311
Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna give you
something to think about.

312
Hold on.

313
But then I started thinking
and I stopped the kissing.

314
Oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue
out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.

315
Look, I realized if anything were to happen
with me and Jill...

316
...then nothing could ever happen
with us.

317
- What?
- No, I mean...

318
Look, I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us again, ever.

319
But I don't wanna know
that it never could.

320
So I stopped it...

321
...and she got mad
and broke my projector.

322
Wow.

323
I don't even know what to say.

324
Thank you.

325
You're welcome.

326
Oh, my God, are you crying?

327
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out.

328
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna spend one more day...

329
...with someone
who's out to sabotage my every move.

330
That's you, Rachel.

331
Yeah, I got that.

332
And you.
I throw myself at you, and you say no?

333
How gay are you?

334
You take care, Jill.

335
- Okay, see you.
- Bye-bye.

336
I can't believe Jill's gone.

337
I can't help it. I opened a gate.

﻿1
Hey, you guys, guess what?

2
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.

3
What is the matter with you?

4
No. Barry and Mindy.

5
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce,"
I immediately go to Ross. Heh.

6
Who's Barry and Mindy?

7
Barry was the guy I almost married,
and Mindy was my best friend.

8
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?

9
That just means he was falling
asleep on top of her instead of me.

10
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
How different would my life be?

11
I know. I've always wondered
how different life would be...

12
...if I'd never gotten divorced.

13
- Which time?
- The first time!

14
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
she was a lesbian.

15
I can't.
I keep seeing it the good way.

16
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.

17
Towards the end of our marriage, I did
karate as a way of releasing the tension...

18
...from, you know,
not doing anything else physical.

19
Maybe the problem was
pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."

20
What if I was still fat?

21
You wouldn't be dating me,
that's for sure.

22
Sure I would.

23
What? You guys think I'm that shallow?

24
No, I think Monica was that fat.

25
Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired
off Days of Our Lives.

26
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.

27
What if I had had the guts
to quit my job?

28
I'd probably be writing for The New
Yorker, being paid to be funny.

29
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow...

30
...I don't have to wear a tie.

31
What if I'd taken that job
at Merrill Lynch?

32
- What?
- Merrill Lynch?

33
A massage client who worked there
said I had a knack for stocks.

34
Why didn't you take it?

35
At that time, you see, I thought that
everything that rhymed was true.

36
So I thought if I worked with stocks...

37
...I'd have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.

38
Do you think if all those things
happened, we'd still hang out?

39
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?

40
Aah! Rob Tilman!

41
No, heh, no, it's me. Ross.

42
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.

43
- No. No, no. Ross Geller.
- Of course! Monica's brother.

44
- Yeah. Right.
- Wow! How are you?

45
- Good. Good, I'm married.
- Oh! Me too! Ha, ha.

46
- Isn't it the best?
- Oh, it's the best. Heh.

47
- So, um, how's Monica?
- Really, really great.

48
Actually, she's right down the street.
Um, you should stop by and say hi.

49
- Oh, I would love to.
- Yeah, she'd be so excited.

50
- Oh, okay.
- Come on.

51
Wait, don't you have to pay for...

52
...Busty Ladies?

53
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me
to pick it up for him, but I...

54
So, Monica,
still going out with Dr. Boring, huh?

55
He's not boring. He's just...

56
He's just low-key.

57
- Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
- Thank you.

58
You know, the hazelnut,
actually not a nut.

59
It's a seed.

60
Wow.

61
Can anyone else name a well-known seed
that's been masquerading as a nut?

62
Oh, dear God. Let me think.

63
Hey.

64
Oh, no. What's the matter?

65
I got another rejection letter.

66
They said my writing was funny,
just not "Archie Comic funny."

67
I gotta get back to the hospital.

68
- All right.
- Okay.

69
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

70
Oh, uh, by the way, the answer is
the Brazil nut.

71
Was his question,
"What's more boring than him?"

72
Hey, man.
Sorry about that Archie thing.

73
You, uh, need me
to give you some money?

74
Hey, I may have no money,
but I still have my pride.

75
Really?

76
Eh.

77
Joey doesn't have to give you money.

78
- TV stars have assistants, right?
- That's an idea.

79
If I hire an assistant,
would you take money from her?

80
No, Joey.
Chandler could be your assistant.

81
He could answer
your fan mail and stuff.

82
That would be great! Let's do that!

83
I could use the money.
Give me time to write.

84
- Great! Welcome aboard.
- Okay!

85
All right. I need to use the bathroom.

86
Since I don't need assistance
in there, take a break!

87
All right.

88
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

89
- Guess what?
- What?

90
Joey just hired Chandler.

91
Oh, that's so sweet.

92
Oh! Hang on!

93
Hang on!

94
Go!

95
No. No, no.
I said sell when it hits 50!

96
Five-oh! It's a number!
It comes after four-nine!

97
No, it's okay. It's okay.
You're allowed one mistake.

98
Just kidding. You are of course fired.

99
Ugh.

100
- Hey, Mon?
- Hey.

101
Mon, look who I ran into.

102
Oh, my God, Rachel!

103
- God, you look terrific!
- Oh, so do you!

104
Thanks.

105
- Did you lose weight?
- You are so sweet to notice.

106
Yes, I lost 3 and a half pounds.

107
Ah!

108
- You remember my friend Chandler?
- Hi.

109
- And that's Phoebe.
- Hi.

110
Sit down. Sit down. How long's it
been since we've seen each other?

111
1987, the day after Christmas.
Uh, Sean McMahan's party.

112
I played you one of my songs.
"Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."

113
Oh, yeah. Right.

114
- So, now, do you still do music?
- Well, sometimes.

115
- Sometime I'll play you...
- Oh, my God!

116
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives
just walked in here!

117
- Rach, he's a friend of ours.
- You are friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?

118
It's hard to be friends with Drake...

119
...because of his busy schedule
and the fact that he's not real.

120
Hey, or I could bring
my keyboard here sometime.

121
- He's coming over.
- Joey?

122
I know. Here, here.

123
Oh.

124
No. This is my friend Rachel.
We went to high school together.

125
- Ha, ha, hi.
- Hi.

126
I...

127
I love you on that show.

128
- Oh.
- I watch you every day.

129
When you took out your
kidney to save your ex-wife...

130
...even though
she tried to kill you...

131
It's always nice to meet fans.

132
- She's not crazy, is she?
- No.

133
So, uh, how you doing?

134
Hang on.

135
Hang on. Hang on.

136
Go!

137
Who's this?

138
Oh, you're gonna like working for me.

139
What's your name?
What kind of name is Brindy?

140
I... Uh, whatever.

141
Stop talking.

142
All right, from now on
your name is Joan.

143
You can pick your own last name.

144
- Hey, there you are.
- Uh-oh, it's my boss.

145
All right, here's a list of things
for you to do today.

146
This is gonna be so great.
Thank you so much.

147
I gotta go to work. I'm delivering
twins, but only one of them is mine.

148
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins."

149
Teach me how to spell vitamins.

150
"Wear in my new jeans."

151
- You realize what you are, don't you?
- What?

152
You're his bitch.

153
No, no! No!

154
Wait! You didn't sit on my
Kit Kats did you?

155
No, there was a little,
little dip in the market...

156
...and I lost $13 million.

157
But the Kit Kats are all right?

158
What am I gonna do?
I can't call my office, they'll kill me.

159
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!

160
- All right, now my chest hurts.
- What?

161
My chest hurts. Ugh.

162
- Ugh! And now, I can't breathe.
- Are you having a heart attack?

163
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?

164
- Yes.
- Then, yes. That is what I'm having.

165
Oh, my God!

166
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.

167
Most people'd be excited if they
didn't work for a couple weeks.

168
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.

169
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.

170
I miss Joan.

171
Honey, a heart attack is nature's
way of telling you to slow down.

172
I always thought it was nature's way
of telling you to die. Heh.

173
You're not gonna die.

174
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.

175
I wish I was dead.

176
Let's take a walk.

177
You should consider writing for
Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.

178
So what's going on with you?

179
Well, um, I've been doing a lot more
of my karate.

180
- Still a dry spell with Carol?
- Yeah.

181
How long has it been since
you've had sex?

182
- Well, last weekend...
- That's not so bad.

183
...will be two months...

184
...since I stopped trying.

185
You need to spice things up.

186
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

187
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.

188
Oh.

189
- Dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys.
- Wow.

190
Role-playing.
You're warden, she's prisoner.

191
- You're the pirate, she's the wench.
- Okay, I think I got it.

192
You could be two stockbrokers,
rolling naked on the trading floor...

193
...and everybody's watching.

194
It never happened.

195
And over there is Brady's Pub...

196
...where I unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning."

197
Wow! This is so amazing. What else?

198
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.

199
And, uh, that is an old man.

200
- Hey, old man!
- Hey.

201
Alrighty. What do you say we head
back to my place?

202
Well, wow. Um, you know,
I would really love to, but I shouldn't.

203
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning?

204
Just for a moment. Just for us.

205
Isn't that a line from the show?

206
Uh, yeah, but, uh...

207
...I may have said
those things before, but...

208
...I never truly meant them until now.

209
That's a line from the show too!

210
Okay, you watch too much TV.

211
Joe, here's the freshly-squeezed
orange juice you asked for.

212
- Thanks.
- Hi.

213
Yeah, there's pulp in that.

214
- Yeah?
- Heh.

215
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.

216
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice. Okay?

217
I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp.

218
God, I'm sorry. I am being so rude.

219
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?

220
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.

221
Yeah, well, sure,
iced tea would be great.

222
Iced tea.

223
Okay. Anything for you, sir?

224
Did I not just tell him?

225
Okay, look, Chandler,
if this is gonna work...

226
...you have got to listen.

227
You're gonna throw that juice at me,
aren't you?

228
It's not all juice.

229
Honey, this morning was fun, huh?

230
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?

231
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
a place with two bathrooms.

232
Look, Carol, um, I was thinking maybe...

233
...maybe we can spice things
up a little.

234
- What do you mean?
- Carol, our sex life. It's just not...

235
- Dad!
- Hey there, little fella!

236
Hey, why don't we get
some shoes on you?

237
Show Dad how you
put your shoes on in your room.

238
- Yay!
- Yay!

239
Yay!

240
Seriously, our sex life.

241
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...

242
...we could try some new things,
you know, for fun.

243
- Like what?
- Well, I don't know. Um...

244
What if we, uh, were to...

245
...tie each other up?

246
Um, some people eat stuff
off one another.

247
Yeah.

248
Um, you know, we could try dirty talk.
Uh, heh.

249
- Um, we could have a threesome.
- I love that idea!

250
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?

251
Oh, my God, that's so great.
Oh, wow!

252
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present.

253
- Aw.
- Wait a minute.

254
My last Kit Kat bar.

255
- You want to share it?
- Okay!

256
- Hey.
- Hey.

257
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.

258
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.

259
I just... I hate pulp.

260
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?

261
It's not mayonnaise!

262
Okay, uh, anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.

263
- What's this?
- Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.

264
- Just the way you like.
- Aw, thanks, man.

265
Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story
to Archie Comics.

266
Oh, my God, that's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?

267
Oh, you wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.

268
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.

269
Well, um, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.

270
Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.

271
So Reggie hires him as his assist...

272
As his butler.

273
And makes him do crazy things...

274
...like bring him milk shakes
that can't have lumps.

275
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.

276
Did they already do that?
I think I read it!

277
Monica, listen. I have to ask.

278
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.

279
- Does he do this with a lot of girls?
- Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.

280
Ah! And I'm one of them.

281
Wow.

282
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.

283
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?

284
Yeah.

285
I wish we could just not be married
for a little bit.

286
You know, I just wish we could be,
like, on a break.

287
Well, you're not.

288
It's easy for you. You get to
have sex with whoever you want.

289
Yeah, I can. Ha.

290
Don't think I don't. I do.

291
I mean, all the time. You bet!

292
- Monica?
- Hmm?

293
You've done it, right?

294
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?

295
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.

296
Louder. I don't think
the guy in the back heard.

297
Yeah, I heard it.

298
It's not like I haven't had
the opportunity.

299
- I'm waiting for the perfect guy.
- Mm-hm.

300
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect...

301
...but, uh, I'm thinking maybe
I should get it over with.

302
You know, give him my flower.

303
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.

304
- You know what? You are right.
- Sex does not have to be a big deal.

305
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.

306
People should be able to sleep
with whoever, whenever...

307
Rachel. I'm never gonna think it's okay
for you to cheat on your husband.

308
Oh, what do you know, virgin?

309
Phoebe?

310
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?

311
Oh, yeah. The doctor said
that could be one of the side effects.

312
Put the cigarette out.

313
No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!

314
- Put it out.
- Okay, okay!

315
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Come on.

316
- I got it. I got it.
- Give it to me! Give it!

317
Hello?

318
No, she can't come to the phone now.

319
Oh, right. No problem.
Okay, bye-bye.

320
Was it work? Were they mad?
Was it Jack? Did he yell?

321
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.

322
Jack was making sure you
were getting better.

323
Thank God.

324
Yeah, she's fired.

325
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.

326
You've got to let her go.

327
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.

328
Not so fast, Wesley.

329
- Ramoray.
- That's right, Wesley.

330
I just stopped by to say
that you're not a real doctor.

331
And that woman's brain is fine.

332
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

333
- Hope? Hope?
- Drake.

334
You're not dying, Hope.

335
You're gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.

336
Oh, Drake.

337
Okay.

338
Here we go.

339
Okay. Ahem.

340
Mm.

341
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.

342
Um, I am free tomorrow night.

343
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some
sandwiches.

﻿1
So, honey, this, uh...

2
This threesome thing? Uh, heh.

3
How are we even gonna find...?

4
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

5
Oh. Wow.

6
Huh.

7
Boy.

8
Well, someone's been
doing their homework.

9
Yeah. Oh, and I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice...

10
...but she is so...

11
Oh, I know. Ha, ha.

12
You know, just talking about it
is getting me kind of...

13
- I know. Me too.
- Yeah?

14
I think Ben's asleep.

15
Oh, um...

16
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

17
Yeah. Heh.

18
Right. Save it. I can do that.

19
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

20
How's it going?

21
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

22
Here you go, sweetie.

23
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

24
- I put some honey in it.
- Nyeh nyeh honey nyeh nyeh.

25
- She doesn't know she was fired?
- No, the doctors say it may kill her.

26
What are you two girls
whispering about over there?

27
But I think we should tell her.

28
Ugh, I mean, it's just so realistic.

29
I know. Yeah.

30
- His name's Pat.
- Pat the dog.

31
Oh! Oh! I get it! Ha, ha!

32
Oh, God.

33
You, uh? You...

34
...ready for a refill?
- Oh, I probably shouldn't.

35
- Oh.
- So I will! Ha.

36
Oh!

37
Wow.

38
- It's like it's raining.
- Pretty cool, huh?

39
But if you think a fish wouldn't get
sucked into the mechanism...

40
...well, you'd be wrong.

41
Um, can I use your bathroom?

42
- It's, uh, right through there.
- Okay. Ah.

43
You know, I gotta tell you.

44
If someone told me a week ago...

45
...that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...

46
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

47
I hope you're hungry.

48
We're starting with oysters.

49
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

50
They have parasites?

51
No. Ha, ha.

52
Um, well, some people say
that oysters are an aphrodisiac.

53
- What people?
- People.

54
People say it.

55
Come here.

56
- So, oysters, huh?
- Ha-ha-ha.

57
And then we're gonna have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

58
Something we can eat...

59
...with our hands.

60
When we were studying
communicable diseases...

61
No, no, no.

62
It's sensual.

63
- Oh. Didn't know. Okay.
- Okay.

64
Oh, no!

65
I'm sorry, it's the hospital.

66
The food looks great.
Save me some?

67
I can't promise anything.

68
We're really gonna do this, huh?

69
Looks like it.

70
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out...

71
- I got it!
- Okay.

72
- Susan, hi.
- Hey.

73
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

74
I'm Ross, by the way.

75
Hello, Ross.

76
- I love what you've done with this space.
- Thank you so much. Heh.

77
How hot is this?

78
I'm sorry you're here with me
instead of Roger.

79
Yeah, me too.

80
Well, I could make it seem
like he's here.

81
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

82
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1979."

83
- Stop it! That's not funny!
- Okay.

84
I'm sorry, okay? It's just...

85
...tonight was supposed to be,
you know, a big deal.

86
- What was tonight?
- You don't want to know what tonight was.

87
Okay.

88
What was tonight?

89
Tonight was going to be my first time.

90
With Roger?

91
Not just with Roger? Oh, my God.

92
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

93
Four different women!

94
I've had sex way more times.

95
How many?

96
Nine.

97
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

98
Well, good. Good for you.
You really think Roger's the perfect guy?

99
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

100
That's what I tell girls about me.

101
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

102
No, you're not.
You are sweet and wonderful...

103
...and this is gonna happen for you.

104
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

105
Okay.

106
I was kidding.

107
So was I.

108
Joey.

109
You're such an amazing actor.

110
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...

111
...and Joey Tribbiani begins?

112
Well, with Dr. Drake...

113
...they always tell me what to say.

114
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

115
- Wow.
- Mm.

116
Tell me something. Whoa!

117
- I just fell right off the couch there.
- Yeah, you did.

118
I'm okay.

119
- Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
- Whoops. Yeah.

120
When was the last time...

121
...someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

122
Wow.

123
I can't feel my hands.

124
Come on. Come here.

125
- Huh?
- Huh.

126
- Oh?
- Ooh.

127
- We can't do this.
- No!

128
- Oyster?
- Yeah.

129
If... if! If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

130
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

131
But I have nothing to compare it to.

132
So even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

133
I do like that.

134
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

135
Well, if it helps, there were only three.

136
So it'd just be for tonight?

137
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

138
Stop it. We're not doing this.

139
- Let's do it!
- No!

140
- Okay!
- Okay!

141
So, um...

142
Do you have any, uh, moves?

143
I have some moves.

144
- I have no moves.
- Okay.

145
Oh, okay, what you doing there?

146
- I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
- Yeah, forget it.

147
- What if I turn out the lights?
- Okay.

148
Oh, yeah.

149
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

150
That's the couch.

151
Oh, my God!

152
I know!

153
I'll tell you something.

154
We are gonna do that again!

155
- Oh, okay!
- Ah!

156
Morning.

157
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

158
Oh, God.

159
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

160
He actually saw you a little bit too.

161
No.

162
Oh, God, we... We didn't, uh?

163
No. No, no.

164
Not after seeing that.

165
God, I'm just a horrible person.

166
- Well, why?
- Because I'm married.

167
That's right, I'm a married woman.

168
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair. Ugh!

169
That's ridiculous.

170
I'm not a "star."

171
I'm just a regular famous actor.

172
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

173
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

174
Hey. Hey, look.

175
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

176
- And she gave me...
- The ring from the cave. Yeah.

177
Wow.

178
Uh, okay, well...

179
Uh...

180
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

181
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

182
And I want you to have it.

183
- No, I couldn't.
- Yes. Yes.

184
And every time you look at it...

185
...I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

186
Now, you had the chance to cheat...

187
...and with me.

188
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

189
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

190
- Look, you want the ring or not?
- Yeah!

191
Hey, look at you! You're up!

192
- All right.
- I thought I'd try to take a walk.

193
You pour me some water.
I'll be back soon.

194
Whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna call work, are you?

195
No. I've learned my lesson.

196
Let's go. Come on. Move it.

197
Phoebe, come on!

198
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

199
Hey, Joe...

200
...did you ever have a threesome?

201
Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
you're a very attractive man, but...

202
No, I...

203
No. The reason I'm asking is that...

204
...I sort of had one last night.

205
- You?
- Yeah.

206
- Wow. All right.
- Yeah.

207
So? Was it amazing?

208
It was, heh...

209
...okay.

210
Just okay? Did you do it right?

211
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

212
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

213
Huh.

214
But still, Ross.

215
Your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

216
Oh, oh, no, absolutely.

217
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

218
It's just...

219
...my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly...

220
...and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

221
Oh.

222
But you got to be with
both of them, right?

223
Not really.

224
Eh, just Carol.

225
- Not the other one?
- No, she kept kicking me away.

226
- You don't want that.
- No.

227
Hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.

228
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

229
- You get a little bored?
- A little.

230
- Yeah. Made a snack.
- Yeah?

231
- What'd you have?
- Just a sandwich.

232
Turkey. A little mustard.

233
- Sounds good.
- It really was.

234
- Hey.
- Hey.

235
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

236
- Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you.
- Heh.

237
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

238
So you, uh,
want to do something tonight?

239
Oh, I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over again.

240
Oh. Oh, right.

241
Right. Because you're still seeing him,
and, uh, he's a good guy.

242
I remember a time...

243
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, totally.

244
Totally. Are you?

245
Great. It's so amazing.

246
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

247
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

248
I'll bet he can.

249
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.

250
- You sure you're okay?
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

251
Aah!

252
My God! Barry!

253
- You said you'd be away all weekend!
- Oh!

254
That's right, I'm sorry. I am early!

255
Finish, please!

256
Surprise, look who's back.

257
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

258
Call security.

259
Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?

260
Heh, I don't think so.

261
- Phoebe?
- Jack! Hey. Ha, ha.

262
- What are you doing here?
- All better. Back to work.

263
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

264
He should do his research, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

265
Well, you were fired.

266
Nuh-uh.

267
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

268
Oh, okay. I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

269
- Anyway, I'll be in my office.
- Ah, heh.

270
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

271
All right, I'll work right here.

272
This is good. Next to this plant.

273
- Phoebe, let's...
- You're in my office.

274
Look, I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

275
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake...

276
You lost 13 million dollars.

277
So now this is all about money?

278
You know, it's bad enough that...
Ow!

279
Oh, you have got to be kidding.

280
- Are you all right?
- I'm having another heart attack.

281
- What?
- I'm having another heart attack!

282
Call 911!

283
Dumb-ass!

284
Pheebs, how's it going?

285
They fired me,
and I'm having a heart attack.

286
- Well, welcome back.
- Yeah.

287
- Hi, Ross.
- Hi, Rachel.

288
- Is Joey Tribbiani here?
- Um, no.

289
If you see him, please tell him
that I'm looking for him...

290
...and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

291
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great!

292
I'm fine! I'm so good.

293
But you know who's not great?

294
Men!

295
- You're a man, right, Ross?
- Yeah.

296
- Sit down.
- Okay.

297
Let me, uh, ask you something.

298
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

299
Why is it that the second
we go out of town...

300
...bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

301
We're sorry.

302
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

303
- Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
- Oh, what are you, a detective?

304
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband...

305
...and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

306
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

307
- Ugh.
- Hey, there are some men...

308
...who'll do whatever
to make their marriage work.

309
There are some men
who will stand by and watch...

310
...as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome"...

311
...with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

312
Who are these men?

313
Just men. A guy I know.

314
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife...

315
...is gay.

316
She is not...

317
She's gay.

318
Oh, my God.

319
She is so gay!

320
I can't believe this.

321
Good day for married people, huh?

322
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

323
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

324
- I guess women aren't that great either.
- Try telling my wife that.

325
- Okay to come in?
- Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.

326
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

327
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?

328
- What?
- I'm the ruptured spleen. Ha, ha!

329
- Why would you do that?
- Because you shouldn't be with him.

330
You should be with me.

331
- Really?
- When you were talking about Roger...

332
...that was killing me. Look.

333
Things like last night don't just happen.

334
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women...

335
...in the morning, I couldn't wait
to just go hang out with my friends.

336
But with you...

337
...heh, I was, you know,
already with a friend.

338
- Chandler.
- You probably don't want to go out with me.

339
I make too many jokes,
I've never been in a serious relationship...

340
...and I guess I'm not
technically a "doctor."

341
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

342
No, there were two.

343
- Including me?
- Oh, yeah.

344
It only takes two heart attacks
To finally make you see

345
One of them won't do it
But the second will set you free

346
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye

347
And that is just what I will do

348
Soon as those bastards I worked for die

349
La, la-la la, la la la la la la
La la la, la la la-la-la la

﻿1
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?

2
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.

3
Yeah. What was I thinking?

4
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip?
Did I do something wrong?

5
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip.

6
You know what's more generous than that?
Fifty percent.

7
- You know what's even more generous?
- I see where you're going.

8
- What's up with the greed, Joe?
- All right, look, I'm sorry, you guys.

9
It's just that I gotta get
these new headshots made...

10
...and they're really expensive, you know.

11
I'm down to like three.

12
Actually, two, because one of them
I kind of blackened in some teeth.

13
Why'd I do that? Ugh.

14
Well, isn't there something you can do
to earn a little extra money?

15
I mean, can't you pick up,
I don't know, an extra shift here?

16
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.

17
Of course, it helps if you've got,
you know, a little of this going on.

18
- Wow, I still have it. Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

19
Wait, don't you have an audition today?
Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job.

20
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

21
Oh, wait a minute.

22
I used to get medical experiments
done on me all the time.

23
Ah, finally, an explanation.

24
No, I used to get paid
for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?

25
Let's see. Uh...
Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again.

26
I really prefer doing that at the home office,
you know?

27
Ooh, ooh, maybe they want some
of my blood or spit or something, huh?

28
- Joey.
- Yeah?

29
What did I tell you about talking
to your friends while you're working?

30
Uh, do it?

31
That guy's been waiting for his coffee
for 10 minutes.

32
He's complained about you three times.

33
Now, where was I?

34
- Hey.
- Hey.

35
- Hey, what have you been up to?
- Oh. We went to a self-defense class today.

36
Wow.

37
Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch
all morning really takes it out of you.

38
Takes it out of you? Heh.

39
- No, now we can kick anybody's ass.
- Yeah.

40
After one class? I don't think so.

41
What, you wanna see me
self-defend myself?

42
Go over there
and pretend you're a sexual predator.

43
Go on, I dare you.

44
Of course you can defend yourself
from an attack you know is coming.

45
That's not enough.

46
Look, I studied karate for a long time.

47
And there's a concept
you should really be familiar with.

48
It's what the Japanese call unagi.

49
Isn't that a kind of sushi?

50
- No, it's a concept.
- Yeah, it is, it is. It's freshwater eel.

51
All right, maybe it means that too.

52
Oh, I would kill
for a salmon-skin roll right now.

53
You know what? Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.

54
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.

55
Unagi is a state of total awareness.

56
Okay? Only by achieving true unagi...

57
...can you be prepared
for any danger that may befall you.

58
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...

59
...or your kettle of fish?

60
All I'm saying is,
it's one thing being prepared...

61
...for an attack against, like, each other.

62
Whole other story being prepared
for an attack, I don't know...

63
A surprise!

64
All right, you knew that was coming,
but that doesn't mean you have unagi.

65
Ooh, if we made reservations,
we could have unagi in about a half-hour.

66
You know what?

67
- Hey, hey, is Monica here?
- No.

68
Okay, look, I need your help.
I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.

69
Well, Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.

70
Heh. She was working on Valentine's Day,
so we're celebrating it tonight.

71
Oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both
of you at one of those romantic spas?

72
Ooh, Joey,
that's actually a really good idea.

73
Yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.

74
Well, as appealing as that does sound
to her boyfriend...

75
...and her brother...

76
...I can't. We promised
we'd make each other gifts this year.

77
- Oh, I love that.
- You guys.

78
You can't make crotchless panties?
You take...

79
- You take a pair of scissors and just cut...
- Okay, okay, okay.

80
So making things,
that sounds so much fun.

81
I thought so too,
until I papier-mâchéd one of my eyes shut.

82
I love papier-mâché. What did you make?

83
I made a:

84
- What is that?
- Nothing.

85
Oh.

86
So, what are you gonna do?

87
Have you guys made anything
that I could take credit for?

88
Ooh, I have, I have.
I started making these little sock bunnies.

89
Oh, for crying out loud.

90
Hey, wait a minute. That is my sock.

91
Now it's your little bunny friend.

92
Okay.

93
This actually is a:

94
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

95
Can I ask you a question
about the Valentine's Day gifts?

96
- Oh, yeah.
- Do we have to make the entire thing?

97
Yes. Why, did you forget to make yours?

98
Of course not.

99
I just have to, uh, go over to the place
where I made it and pick it up.

100
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
I can't wait.
It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.

102
I can't believe it.
Make the presents. Make the presents.

103
- What?
- Just so excited to make the presents!

104
Shoot.

105
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.

106
And with all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.

107
We're at the end
of one of our research cycles...

108
...so we're not looking
for applicants now.

109
That's too bad.
I've kind of been saving up.

110
Uh, you sure there's no studies
I can participate in?

111
Well, here's a schedule
of what's coming up.

112
Ah, thanks.

113
Oh, but this one starts now.

114
That one is available now,
but only identical twins are eligible.

115
- It's a twin study.
- But it's $2000.

116
- Sorry.
- Oh.

117
Well, how about this one?

118
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionists."

119
We already got the results back
on that one, and they're not good.

120
- That was good.
- Wasn't that a blast?

121
- Danger! Danger!
- God, Ross!

122
What the hell was that?

123
A lesson in the importance of unagi.

124
You're a freak.

125
Perhaps.

126
Now, I'm curious.

127
At what point during those girlish screams
would you have begun to kick my ass?

128
All right, so we weren't prepared.

129
I'm sorry I had to take
such drastic measures to make my point.

130
But, look,
I just want you guys to be safe.

131
Oh...

132
Danger!

133
Ah, huh? Unagi.

134
Two thousand bucks is a lot of money.

135
Boy, I wish I had a twin.

136
Where could I find someone...

137
...who looks exactly like me?

138
Hey.

139
Chandler.

140
I sensed it was you.

141
What?

142
Unagi.

143
I'm always aware.

144
Okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?

145
- What's up?
- I can't figure out what to make Monica.

146
Oh. Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?

147
I'm going crazy, okay?

148
Do you have anything around here
that looks homemade?

149
Oh, you know what? She'd love this.

150
It's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.

151
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon."

152
Yeah, yeah. Except Apollo 8
didn't actually land on the moon.

153
But you could write, um:

154
"Your love lets me orbit the moon twice
and return safely."

155
Wait, I can't give this to her.

156
- Why not?
- It says "Captain Ross" on the side.

157
- And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
- Oh.

158
- Danger!
- Aah!

159
Ah. Salmon-skin roll.

160
Okay, okay.

161
Yes, honey, I made it myself.

162
I can't do it. I can't do it.

163
Oh, oh. A mixed tape. A mixed tape.

164
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

165
- You ready to exchange gifts?
- Sure. Okay, you go first.

166
- Okay, come here, come here.
- Okay.

167
Okay, now, it's not wrapped,
because I just finished it.

168
Okay.

169
But I made you a tape
of what I think are all romantic songs.

170
What a great gift.

171
Oh.

172
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

173
Maybe. We'll have to listen and see.

174
- Oh, I love it. Thank you so much. Mwah.
- Aw. Okay. Mwah.

175
Okay, you ready to open yours?

176
- Yeah.
- Okay.

177
It's a sock bunny.

178
Ha, ha. Yeah, yeah.
Remember how I call you "bunny"?

179
Not really.

180
Well, I did one time.
And I wanna start doing it more.

181
- That's what this is about.
- I see.

182
You know, um,
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

183
No. No, she doesn't.

184
Phoebe, what she makes, that's...
They're sock rabbits.

185
They're completely different. Okay, okay.

186
Okay, I didn't make it. I'm sorry.
I totally forgot about tonight...

187
...and that we were supposed
to make the presents.

188
- Oh, it's okay. I don't...
- No, no, it's not okay. It's not.

189
I mean, you're so incredible.

190
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape for me.

191
You know, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna make this up to you. I will.

192
I am going to cook you anything you want
in here.

193
And I'm going to do anything you want
in there.

194
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.

195
Wow.

196
- You are way too young to have seen that.
- Oops. Ha, ha.

197
Your birthday's in a month and a half.

198
What do you say I forget
to get you a present for that too?

199
You are totally and completely
100 percent forgiven.

200
- We have got to wash that.
- Yeah.

201
Hey, do you remember that jacket
that you loved so much...

202
...that you thought was too expensive?
- You have done enough.

203
Ha, ha. I'm gonna wake up early
and get it for you.

204
No, you don't have...
Get it in black, not brown.

205
- Oop. Your cake is ready.
- Oop.

206
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake."

207
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.

208
Who the hell are you?

209
I'm Joey.

210
How are you doing?

211
No, no, no!

212
"How you doing?"

213
"How you doing?"
Damn it, Carl. Go wait in the hall.

214
- Look, I got to apologize on behalf of Carl.
- Who the hell is Carl?

215
Oh, did I not mention?

216
Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin
for a medical research project.

217
You know, sometimes the good ideas
are just right in front of you, aren't they?

218
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but I think it might work.

219
But the only problem is Carl's acting is:

220
The only problem?

221
Yeah. He's the reason I didn't get
that big Minute Maid commercial.

222
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed it up.

223
Hey. Can I get a little piece of that cake?

224
Pizza. We like pizza. Get out!

225
- Pat Sajak?
- Yep.

226
- Alex Trebek?
- Oh, of course.

227
- Chuck Woolery?
- Definitely.

228
Phoebe, you will not find
a single game-show host...

229
...whose ass I cannot kick.

230
- Say it.
- Say we are unagi.

231
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.

232
Say it.

233
I could easily get out of this...

234
...but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt.

235
All right, Carl, we're next.
Now, remember, what is this not gonna be?

236
- Another Minute Maid fiasco.
- That's right.

237
And what are you not gonna do?

238
- I'm not gonna talk, because...
- Ah. Damn it, Carl.

239
Can I have the next one, please?

240
Thank you.

241
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.

242
That's us.

243
But, uh, this is a study
for identical twins.

244
That's right. Two thousand dollars.

245
But you're not identical twins.

246
Damn it, Carl.

247
Oh, my good God.

248
Hey. Continuing the countdown
of your favorite meals.

249
Tonight, number three:

250
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.

251
Look, you have done enough, okay?
You have to stop this now.

252
I will, but not tonight.

253
For dinner music, I thought we could listen
to that tape that you made me.

254
- Oh, the mixed tape.
- Mm-hm.

255
When I'm awfully low

256
Oh. "The Way You Look Tonight"
is on here.

257
Dance with me.

258
I will feel a glow

259
Just thinking of you

260
And the way you look tonight

261
You are just the sweetest.

262
I love the way
you look every night, Chandler.

263
That's why I made you this tape.

264
Happy birthday. Love, Janice. Mwah.

265
No, you're the sweetest.

266
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.
Let's remember, let's be safe out there.

267
- Great class. Heh.
- Thanks, man.

268
Yeah, yeah. I was watching.

269
Um, hey, a couple of questions, though.

270
Um, you know that last move...

271
...where that woman tripped you
and then pinned you to the floor?

272
What would you do next?

273
Well, then she'd take her keys
and jam them in your...

274
No, no, no. What would you do next?

275
- Who, me, the attacker?
- Yes, that's right.

276
Why?

277
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.

278
- What?
- No, I mean, it's okay.

279
I mean, they're my friends.
In fact, I was married to one of them.

280
Let me get this straight.
You attacked your ex-wife?

281
Oh, no, no, no. Heh.

282
I tried.

283
But I couldn't. That's why I'm here.

284
Maybe we could attack them together.

285
That's a no.

286
I am so, so, so sorry.

287
Uh-huh.

288
Oh! And I will cook anything you want
in here...

289
...and do anything you want in there.

290
Yeah, you will, and are you kidding me?

291
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.

292
Please, please, please?

293
- Okay.
- Okay.

294
My funny valentine

295
Sweet comic valentine
You make me...

296
- So are we going in there?
- I am.

297
Your looks are laughable

298
Aha.

299
Nowhere to run.

300
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over...

301
No, Rachel, they got here first.

302
- Why is Ross doing that?
- Danger!

303
Oh, my God.
Why is he jumping on those women?

304
We should help them.

305
I don't think they need any help.

﻿1
Hey.

2
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Check out what this one student wrote.

3
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

4
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie
of the Paleontology Department."

5
Ah, "Hotties of
the Paleontology Department."

6
There's a big-selling calendar, huh?

7
Who wrote it?

8
I wish I knew,
but the evaluations are all anonymous.

9
- Do you still have their final exams?
- Yeah.

10
Match the evaluation to the exam with the
same handwriting and there's your admirer.

11
A hot girl's at stake
and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.

12
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why are we so sure that this is a girl?

13
It's a girl.

14
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?

15
- Because I'm a teacher. She's a student.
- Oh, is that against the rules?

16
- No, but it is frowned upon.
- I see.

17
- Besides, there's a big age difference.
- Think of it like this. When you're 90...

18
I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...

19
...and it won't seem
like such a big difference.

20
No, that's not what I was gonna say
at all.

21
What I was gonna say is
when you're 90...

22
...you'll still have the memory
of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

23
Chandler, you know that girl you went to
college with who became a movie director?

24
Oh, yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

25
What's a movement class?

26
It's Chandler's way
of pretending he didn't take mime.

27
Listen, anyway,
she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.

28
- You gotta get me an audition.
- Oh. I haven't talked to her in like 10 years.

29
Oh, no, no, no. Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

30
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3400...

31
Hey, hey, dude.
Why you changing the subject? What?

32
- Will you make the call or what?
- Okay, I'll try.

33
All right. Thanks, you're the best.

34
The last day of auditions is Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

35
Just remember Thursday. Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?

36
Yeah, so Tuesday?

37
Thursday. Look, if you need help
remembering, just think of it like this.

38
The third day. All right?
Monday, one day.

39
Tuesday, two day.

40
Wednesday, when, huh, what day?
Thursday.

41
The third day, okay?

42
- Thank you.
- Okay.

43
- Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages.
- You just thought of that in there?

44
Sure, you know, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

45
Hello?

46
Uh...

47
Rachel.

48
You guys, someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops.

49
You're on the phone.

50
- Oh, my God.
- What?

51
Oh, my God. Thank you.
That was the Fire Department.

52
- There was a fire at our place.
- Oh, my God. How bad was it?

53
He didn't say, but it was a fire.
I'm guessing not very good.

54
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Phoebe, come on.

55
What are you smiling about?
What is so funny?

56
The part I wanna audition for is a fireman.
This is so meant to be.

57
Wow. Looks like you were very generous
with your grades this semester.

58
- Professor Geller?
- Yeah? Huh?

59
I wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your class.

60
Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.

61
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you
a hottie on my evaluation.

62
- That was you?
- Yeah.

63
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

64
But would you maybe wanna go out
with me sometime?

65
Oh, I... Heh.
I don't think that would be the best idea.

66
Oh, because I was thinking, um,
the semester's over.

67
- You're not my teacher anymore.
- What time?

68
Oh, you know what? Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A.

69
- Gotcha.
- I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.

70
- Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

71
So seriously, what time?

72
Coming through. Oh.
Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.

73
No, right. Coming through.

74
- Oh.
- Okay. Well, it's not so bad.

75
Most of the damage
was contained to the bedrooms.

76
Oh, my God.

77
Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

78
- Excuse me?
- Joey. He's working.

79
You would look good in that.

80
- Uh-oh. How bad is it?
- Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.

81
The only thing that isn't burned is an ax,
which I do not remember buying.

82
- How's your room, Rach?
- Everything's ruined.

83
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite blue sweater.

84
Isn't that mine?

85
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

86
You're not gonna be able to live here
for a while.

87
- You ladies have a place to stay?
- Oh. Wow.

88
Okay, look, pal...

89
...I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

90
But if you give me your number,
I will call you some other time.

91
Yes, they can stay with us.

92
Have you figured out what started the fire,
Mr. Fireman?

93
Well, uh, do either of you smoke?

94
No, not usually.

95
- But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks.
- No, no.

96
- Do you light candles, burn incense?
- Yes, I do all the time. I love them.

97
Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.

98
I burned down the house.
I burned down the house!

99
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

100
I warned her about those candles.

101
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.

102
Hey, Chandler, is that?

103
- Oh, that's great. Good for you.
- So, hey, hey, is it?

104
Okay, so, yeah,
maybe we can get together, um...

105
Can you hold on for one second, please?

106
What?

107
When you're off the phone,
you wanna get a pizza?

108
Hi, I'm back.

109
Yeah, that sounds great.
Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.

110
Hey, listen, so when's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

111
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.

112
- I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then.
- Ah.

113
Wow, so now you're going on a date
with this girl?

114
Not a date.
I haven't talked to her in 10 years.

115
You can't call somebody you haven't
talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.

116
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

117
You're right, I'm sorry.

118
- It's not like you're going out with an ex.
- No, we only went out once.

119
You dated her?

120
Not once.

121
Great. Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

122
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

123
Oh. That's great.
My friend Joey's in the movie business.

124
Mm. You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

125
- Hmm. My friend's name is Joey.
- Heh.

126
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

127
Yeah, he calls me up
and asks me if he can edit my new movie.

128
Heh. Can you believe that?

129
You know,
I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...

130
...and he asks me for a favor?

131
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

132
No "How you doing?" Heh.

133
Man, I mean,
not even a cup of coffee first.

134
- Heh. The nerve, huh?
- Yeah.

135
Refill?

136
Now, this is last-minute,
so I want to apologize for the mess.

137
- Oh.
- Who cares?

138
Oh, my God.

139
It sure didn't look this way
when I lived here.

140
I know.

141
There's one problem, though.

142
There's only room for one, so I guess
one of you will have to stay at Joey's.

143
Well, since the fire was kind of my fault,
I guess you should get to stay here.

144
Hey, hey, hey, now.

145
This was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay?
It was an accident.

146
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

147
Okay. Whoo!

148
So, Rach,
you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.

149
Hotel Monica.

150
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

151
I thought I'd bring them to you,
you know, in bed.

152
- Aw.
- You've been through so much.

153
I have.

154
This right here is where I keep the pizza.

155
And that's where the napkin is.

156
- What's that smell?
- I know. I don't...

157
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

158
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.

159
Who?

160
Oh. I had trouble
remembering everyone's names...

161
...so I came up with nicknames.

162
Like the guy on the other side of you
was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.

163
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

164
- So, um, did you have a nickname for me?
- Uh, no. No.

165
Yes, you did. What was it?

166
Um, it's...

167
Cutie McPretty.

168
Oh, that's so sweet.

169
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

170
You know how you said it might be weird,
the whole student-teacher thing?

171
And to be frank, I thought it would be too.
But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.

172
- Dr. Geller.
- Burt.

173
So did you sleep well last night?

174
- I did.
- Yeah?

175
I did. Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

176
- Know what Joey left on my pillow?
- What?

177
Gum.

178
- Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
- Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.

179
No, there was an appliance left on
in the bathroom.

180
It looks like a curling iron.

181
- I don't use a curling iron.
- Well, someone does.

182
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

183
- It could've been a hair-straightener.
- Oh.

184
This is where I keep the pizza.

185
And... Hey, where'd the napkin go?

186
There you go. I wouldn't want
my best guest to strain her eyes.

187
Thanks, Monica.

188
- Does that smell bother you?
- What, the smell from Joey's?

189
No, I can hardly smell it over here.

190
Well, you let me know if you can.
Because I can bake a pie to cover it.

191
- I can smell it a little. Bake the pie.
- Okay.

192
Hello?

193
Oh, yes, one minute, please.
It's for you. It's the fire inspector.

194
Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

195
Really?

196
Yeah, so it turns
out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...

197
...that started the fire.

198
No, no. It was the candles.

199
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

200
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is...

201
Uh...

202
Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.

203
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

204
I thought the age difference
might be a problem, but it wasn't.

205
It wasn't at all.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

206
A concept lost on some people.

207
So it's okay to date a student?

208
Well, not really.

209
I mean, technically,
it's not against the rules or anything.

210
But it is frowned upon...

211
...especially by that professor
we ran into last night.

212
Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.

213
Just be careful, okay?

214
You don't wanna get a reputation
as Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.

215
- Yeah. What should I do?
- Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.

216
I mean, what's more important,
what people think or how you feel? Huh?

217
- Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
- Joey, that is so sweet.

218
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?

219
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open, say, Thursday?

220
- I couldn't do it.
- You couldn't do it?

221
Relax, I just need more time.
We're going to dinner.

222
What? You're going out with her again?

223
- Going out with who?
- Dana Keystone, from college.

224
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm?

225
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

226
- Oh.
- Ah.

227
- Joey, you didn't even know her.
- Yeah, whatever.

228
Great story again.

229
The yarns that you weave.

230
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

231
You know, uh, actually,
I should get going.

232
Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay,
because you should...

233
You should stay.

234
Wow.

235
Oh, I am really flattered.

236
But I just...
I don't feel that way about you.

237
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not... No, no, no.
- I'm sorry, Chandler.

238
You know, you are such a sweet guy,
and I don't wanna hurt you.

239
Oh, I wish there were something I could do
to make you feel better.

240
No, no, no... Really?

241
Of course.

242
Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...

243
Oh, I'm sorry.

244
- Well, maybe there is one thing you can do.
- What? Anything. Anything.

245
Well, I mean, this is just off the top
of my head now. Um...

246
Ahem. But I have this friend, uh,
this actor friend...

247
...and he would kill me
if he knew that I was doing this, um...

248
...but, um, would it be possible for him
to get an audition for your movie...

249
...say, on Thursday?

250
Absolutely.

251
But you'd really feel better
about me rejecting you...

252
...if your friend can audition
for my movie?

253
Well, the heart wants what it wants.
I'll see you later.

254
Hey. How's it going?

255
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

256
Yes, it has. I made cookies.

257
That's all right. I'm still full
from your homemade potato chips, so...

258
Oh. But you should eat them now
because they're hot from the oven.

259
- Okay.
- Oh. But not in here.

260
Can't eat them in bed, remember?
No crummies.

261
Oh.

262
I'll be out in a second.

263
Okay.

264
- What are you doing?
- This doesn't lock, does it?

265
- Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh.
- Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.

266
No, but look.
Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.

267
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.

268
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

269
- Huh.
- Yeah.

270
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

271
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha.

272
All right, well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

273
What do you wanna do now, huh?
You wanna go get a drink?

274
Uh, I can't.

275
- Oh, you have some studying to do?
- No, I have some turning 21 to do.

276
Okay. Ha, ha.

277
You know, I remember
when I was in college, we used to...

278
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm just...

279
I'm so comfortable with you.

280
- Do you not wanna be seen with me?
- What?

281
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

282
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

283
What? No, no, wait, wait.

284
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

285
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.

286
Come on.

287
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

288
- This is Elizabeth.
- Hi.

289
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?

290
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth here is a student.

291
And we're dating.

292
And you may frown upon that...

293
...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.

294
You are so fired.

295
- What?
- They're gonna fire you.

296
You can't date a student.
It's against the rules.

297
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

298
- Oh. Ah.
- Ah!

299
I love it at Joey's.

300
There you go.

301
- Ooh. Thanks.
- Nice.

302
- So you busy Thursday?
- Oh, very funny.

303
I don't know if you remember, but my
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

304
You got me the audition?

305
- Yeah.
- Oh, let's hug it up.

306
Okay, okay, okay.

307
What are you gonna do to me
if you get the part?

308
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
- Hi.
- Hi.

310
- Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
Uh-huh.

311
Now, I know that they said
that the hair-straightener started the fire...

312
...but I think I'm partly at fault.

313
You see, I didn't tell you,
but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.

314
And so, you know,
let's face it, that's just kindling.

315
So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.

316
No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.

317
- Besides, you know what? I'm fine here.
- Okay.

318
- Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
- Really?

319
- Yeah, she said something about crummies.
- No, no, no. I was so careful.

320
Okay. You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

321
That's right.
All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.

322
No, Phoebe, come on,
I don't wanna switch.

323
Please. Come on,
I can throw wet paper towels here.

324
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

325
I know. I'm sorry.

326
All right, fine.

327
- This looks like so much fun.
- Ha, ha.

328
God, what a mess.

329
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

330
I can't date you
or have a hot plate in my office.

331
Oh, I can't believe
we have to stop seeing each other.

332
For what it's worth,
I did appreciate you standing up for me.

333
That felt really nice.

334
Kind of made me like you even more.

335
I know, I know. I really like you too.
But we can't date.

336
It's against the rules. It's forbidden.

337
Wow.

338
- What?
- Just hearing you describe it...

339
...as forbidden, it's really hot.

340
Really?

341
Yeah.

342
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh...
It's wrong.

343
- Stop it.
- No, no. It's wrong. It's...

344
It's naughty.

345
It's...

346
...taboo.

347
Shut the book.

348
- Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.
- Oh.

349
- Hey.
- Hey.

350
- So?
- So?

351
- It's Thursday. How was the audition?
- It's Thur...?

352
Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thur...

353
Oh!

﻿1
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

2
All right. A-ha. Heh.

3
Damn fridge!

4
- Hi, Joey. How you doing?
- Great...

5
...roomie.
- Ah!

6
- Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
- I know. Now that you bring it up...

7
...uh, our fridge is broken.
We have to get a new one.

8
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

9
I'm not paying for half of that.

10
I'm only staying here
until my apartment gets fixed.

11
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
just after I was born. Okay?

12
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

13
What does that tell you?

14
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

15
All right, you know that the ATM only
lets you take out 300 at a time...

16
...so I'll take a check
for the other 100.

17
Heh. You're joking, right?

18
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

19
Thank God you're pretty.

20
- Hey!
- Hey.

21
Hey, do you guys know
any cute guys?

22
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.

23
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

24
Anyway, there's a charity ball this weekend
and Ralph Lauren bought a table...

25
...so I kind of have to go.

26
- What's the charity?
- I don't know.

27
Something, either trees or disease, I...

28
- Ralph mumbles a lot.
- Does Ralph mumble...

29
...when you're not paying attention?
- Yeah. It's weird.

30
But the thing is, I need to find a date.

31
What kind of guy
are you looking for?

32
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

33
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

34
Ooh, so close.

35
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

36
- Uh, this is Elizabeth.
- Hi, Elizabeth.

37
- I'm the student.
- Ha-ha-ha.

38
Isn't she cute? Nope.

39
This is none of my business,
but weren't you guys supposed...

40
...to not be seen in public together?
- Oh, we're not together.

41
No. We're just two people
who happen to have run into each other...

42
...here at the coffee house.
Heh, this is...

43
Oh, sly.

44
I really wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

45
- I'll see you later?
- Okay.

46
- Bye, Ross.
- Bye. See you.

47
- Oh...
- Oops.

48
- Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
- That is quite all right, ma'am.

49
Bye.

50
So why's she leaving? Is it a school night
and she has a lot of homework to do?

51
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

52
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.

53
Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.

54
- Oh! When's her birthday?
- I don't know, Rachel. Why?

55
Well, you know it's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

56
- I like Elizabeth.
- Well, thanks.

57
In fact, I like her so much that you tell
her I want my cookies early this year.

58
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.

59
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?

60
Well, it's actually been great.

61
She's 20, so she's not looking
for anything too serious...

62
...which is perfect for me now.

63
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.

64
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

65
...but it means a lot to me
that you like her.

66
- Just knowing you guys are, like...
- Okay, I got a good one.

67
Okay, um... Heh.

68
What is she, like, 12?

69
Chandler, do you think we talk
about our relationship enough?

70
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?

71
- Hey.
- Hey.

72
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

73
That's so funny,
we found someone too.

74
That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

75
- Why would our guy be a weirdo?
- Because that's just your taste.

76
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

77
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

78
My guy is a lawyer
who does volunteer work.

79
And he has one of these.

80
A face ass?

81
- A chin dimple.
- Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.

82
And he's really nice and smart
and he's a great dresser.

83
- Have you seen your guy's body?
- No. Our guy's just a floating head.

84
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.

85
And one time, um, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.

86
- You're not supposed to look.
- Yeah, like there are police for that.

87
- What, you look? You massaged me.
- I know.

88
All right, your guy may have
a great body, but our guy...

89
...is really funny.
- Chandler funny?

90
- Our guy's a great dancer.
- My guy's well-read.

91
- Our guy has great hair.
- My guy has great teeth.

92
Our guys smells incredible.

93
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

94
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

96
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

97
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

98
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

99
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

100
Ahem, so, anyway,
how do you want to pay me?

101
Is this a service you're providing me?

102
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

103
Our new fridge?

104
- I don't live here anymore.
- So what?

105
Look, okay, suppose we were
a, uh, divorced couple.

106
- Uh-huh.
- And I got custody of the kid. Right?

107
Now, suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

108
Okay.

109
Give me $400!

110
- Professor Geller?
- Hmm?

111
Oh, a student I don't know.

112
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment?

113
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

114
- Making out in your office.
- Wh... Shh!

115
Uh, of course. Why don't we go inside.

116
Mm... Oh, oh.

117
- What?
- Doorknob. Doorknob.

118
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

119
- Um, I actually do need to talk to you.
- Oh. Okay, what about?

120
- Spring vacation.
- Spring vacation?

121
Yeah, we have time off,
and a lot of people are going on trips...

122
- Professor Geller.
- Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?

123
I'll be with you in one moment.

124
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

125
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

126
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?

127
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her the truth. You're not ready.

128
I could do that.

129
- Well, what if she gets upset?
- Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

130
Or...

131
...you could just, you know, you...

132
What the hell are you doing?

133
Wha...?

134
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

135
What? How do you know if...
How do you know it's even broken?

136
Oh, you think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

137
Excuse me.

138
Well, what do you know? Broken!

139
That'll be $400.

140
Joey, I saw you push him.

141
You pushed him.

142
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

143
- Remember I told you about our fridge?
- Uh-huh.

144
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

145
Do not give him any money.

146
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

147
- You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
- Yes. Yes. Please come in.

148
Mm, ooh, ooh.

149
- Doorknob?
- Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

150
Actually, I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

151
Oh, good.

152
Look, I...

153
Look, I've been having
a great time with you.

154
And I just don't want us to move too fast
or put too much pressure on us.

155
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

156
It's too soon.

157
Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

158
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.

159
No.

160
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

161
- What I meant was...
- You are so adorable.

162
That. Let's talk about that.

163
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
- How did it go with Elizabeth?
- Huh? Oh, oh.

165
Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

166
She just wanted to let me know that
she's going to Florida for spring vacation.

167
Wait, is she going for spring vacation
or going for spring break.

168
What's the difference?

169
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

170
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

171
Hey, you know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

172
- What did you do on yours?
- I went to Egypt with my dad.

173
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."

174
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than, "Spring break!"

175
All right?
Come on, she's taking my class.

176
- And slept with the professor.
- I'm gonna call her.

177
Hey, you guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

178
- Hi.
- We just, uh...

179
We just met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!

180
What, I read that.

181
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

182
- Rachel, what the hell is this?
- What?

183
You ask us to find you a guy, and then
you come in here with a guy of your own.

184
- You found me a guy?
- Yes.

185
We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

186
Yeah, and I found you one, too,
who is not a weirdo.

187
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

188
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
to the charity.

189
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.

190
Would you stop it with that already?

191
- Here you go. Sure.
- Oh, thank you.

192
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

193
- Uh, no, not really. Why?
- No reason.

194
It's just I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

195
Are you funny?

196
- Excuse me?
- What are you guys doing?

197
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

198
Look, I just wanted
to have coffee with Rachel.

199
Well, so do a lot of people.

200
- Actually, uh, I gotta get going.
- Oh, but you...

201
- Give me a call sometime.
- But you didn't give me your number.

202
Okay, see you later.

203
Turns out he is kind of funny.

204
I cannot believe you guys!

205
He was really nice
and he just left because of you!

206
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

207
You know what I noticed, Rachel,
he scares easy.

208
Now, is that the kind of guy
you want to take to a ball?

209
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

210
"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"

211
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

212
That is a very insensitive thing
for us to do.

213
You know what? Let us make it up
to you. We've two great guys for you.

214
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

215
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

216
- All right.
- Okay. So you will meet our guys?

217
Yes, I'll meet them.

218
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

219
Our guy is perfect.

220
Or you could go out with the guy
Phoebe deemed...

221
...not good enough to go out with herself.
- Ugh!

222
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.

223
You owe me 400 bucks.

224
- Okay, sure.
- Really?

225
Ooh, technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

226
...on your last 10 auditions.

227
Call it even?

228
Okay.

229
There you are.
So, what did Elizabeth say?

230
Well, turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, woo-hoo."

231
That means wet T-shirt contests,
guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...

232
...waking up next to people
you don't even know.

233
Man, she is gonna have a great time!

234
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

235
- You know the hotels?
- I was there, Spring Break '81!

236
In 1981, you were 13.

237
So what? I drove down,
sold T-shirts. I had a blast.

238
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

239
Okay, she can't go.

240
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

241
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. Just be cool with it.

242
What if she goes down there
and sleeps with a bunch of guys?

243
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

244
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

245
Yeah, I've been working
so hard this semester.

246
I really need to go crazy, you know?
Blow off some steam.

247
Sure. Sure.

248
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet...

249
...but I know another great way
to blow off steam.

250
- What?
- Are you into crafts at all?

251
- Ross, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.

252
Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.

253
Supportive of you and this whole trip...

254
...and what... What is, uh...? What's this?

255
- It's a bathing suit?
- To wear in front of people?

256
- Is that supportive?
- Is this?

257
- Hey.
- Good, good, good.

258
- Hey.
- Hi.

259
- We're glad you decided to meet our guy.
- Oh.

260
You're gonna like him so much.

261
- Uh, when do you want to meet him?
- I don't know.

262
- I don't work late tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night is good.

263
But why put off something till tomorrow
that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.

264
- Eldad, come here!
- What?

265
- Eldad, this is Rachel.
- How are you?

266
A little blind-sided,
but, you know, good.

267
Eldad, sit down. Move over.
Move over now.

268
There you go. There you are.

269
- Okay, we can take a hint!
- Ha-ha-ha.

270
- Wait. What are you doing here?
- This is Patrick.

271
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
You're too late,
because she's already with our guy.

273
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

274
Come on.

275
- Rachel? This is Patrick.
- Yeah?

276
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

277
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

278
Believe me, this suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

279
Okay.

280
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

281
Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

282
- You can't do that!
- Maybe I should go.

283
Just sit down, we're winning.

284
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should go.

285
- No, no!
- Have a seat!

286
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

287
- It is the softest hair. Touch it.
- I'm good.

288
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

289
Phoebe, this isn't really worth
the free massage.

290
That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.

291
Eldad is much more cooperative
and he can dance.

292
You dance for Rachel.

293
No, don't dance for me, please!

294
What is the matter with you guys?

295
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.

296
Am I the only one
that this is embarrassing for?

297
- I'm a little embarrassed.
- Shh, shh.

298
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys. This is ridiculous!

299
Thank you,
but I do not need you to get me a date.

300
- Then why did she ask us to help...
- I am still talking!

301
Then you chase away
the one guy that I actually liked.

302
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

303
...all the cash.

304
And you really...
Wow, you do have very soft hair.

305
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself
than go through any more of this!

306
Goodbye.

307
Now, do you use some sort
of special conditioner on that hair?

308
- Yes, papaya extract.
- Thank you.

309
- So, uh, have a great time down there.
- I will.

310
- Did you pack that bathing suit?
- Yeah.

311
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while, huh?

312
Anyway. Um...

313
I am worried about that bathing suit.

314
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

315
No, I'm concerned about your health.

316
Um, sun exposure.

317
Oh, don't worry,
I have plenty of sun block.

318
- It's SPF 30.
- All right.

319
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

320
I mean, sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4, and I swear...

321
...more often than not, it's just milk.

322
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

323
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

324
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.

325
- Really?
- Yeah.

326
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

327
Okay. Cool. Heh.

328
- Oh, here they are.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

329
Bye!

330
Call me!

331
Rachel, we're sorry
for pushing those guys on you.

332
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

333
The charity was a big success,
they raised a lot of money and awareness.

334
So, what was it for, anyway?

335
I wanna say a disease.

336
- Hey.
- Hey.

337
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said turn on MTV. I don't know.

338
- Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Ha-ha-ha.

339
Oh, oh, Professor Geller.

340
Ah, to be 13 again.

﻿1
- Hi.
- Hey.

2
So, uh, did everything go okay
with the annulment?

3
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

4
- Ross, thank you.
- Ah.

5
- You guys want to go see a movie?
- Yeah, why not?

6
- Let me get my sweater.
- Okay.

7
Want to hear something weird?

8
Always.

9
I didn't get the annulment.

10
- What?
- We're still married.

11
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

12
- Hey, do you have any gum?
- Oh, yeah.

13
Wait! Wait! Hi. Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

14
Oh, but we'll be late for the movie.

15
Oh, there's a cab. Taxi!

16
Oh, that's great.

17
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

18
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

19
Oh, the Angelika! Go! Go!

20
You didn't get the annulment?

21
- I know.
- Ross!

22
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

23
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"

24
I just don't want my tombstone to read
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces."

25
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

26
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."

27
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."

28
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

29
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

30
Woman. Sorry.

31
Well, okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

32
- Just don't say anything to Rachel.
- Rachel is one of my closest friends.

33
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

34
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

35
Hey, Rach!

36
What was that?

37
Sorry. Mix-up.

38
How was the movie?

39
I haven't seen it yet.

40
You'd better hurry. The Angelika! Go. Go!

41
No!

42
When we move in together,
can I get a gumball machine?

43
Of course.
Joey wouldn't let you have one?

44
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

45
Did you tell him you're moving out?

46
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out "Joey, I have to..."

47
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with "...go to the bathroom."

48
He may think I'm sick.

49
I have to tell Rachel, but I...
We just gotta get it over with.

50
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

51
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

52
- Pretty much.
- All right.

53
Hey, Monica.
Hey, man, you feeling better?

54
Joey.

55
We have something to tell you.

56
Oh, my God!

57
You're pregnant!

58
No! No?

59
- No.
- No!

60
Look, Joe, here's the thing. Um...

61
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

62
So I'm gonna be moving out, man.

63
Wow.

64
Oh, uh, hey!

65
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

66
- Joey! Joey! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

67
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

68
Like you'd believe that.

69
This sucks!

70
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you...

71
...the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

72
Look, uh, If you're gonna move in
with him...

73
...I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

74
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

75
He, uh, forgets to, um...

76
He always, he always, uh...

77
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

78
- Hey, Pheebs. Have you seen Rachel?
- Hey.

79
- No, why?
- I have some exciting news.

80
You're pregnant.

81
No!

82
Chandler and I are moving in together.

83
Oh, that's good!

84
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

85
- Hey.
- Hey.

86
- What's up?
- Well, um...

87
Chandler and I are moving in together.

88
Oh, my God.

89
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend...

90
...shacking up.

91
That's great. That's great. Mwah.

92
- Guys, I'm happy too.
- Okay, come here.

93
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

94
I gotta go find Rachel. But, um...

95
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

96
Okay, bye.

97
Hmm. Something bad to tell Rachel.

98
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

99
Can you just lay off, please?

100
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

101
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

102
You'll have a life, you'll date...

103
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

104
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy...

105
...uh, Murderer Guy...

106
...and geologists.

107
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

108
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

109
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

110
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

111
Nobody cares about this except you.

112
This embarrassment thing
is all in your head.

113
- Here, I'll show you. Come here.
- What?

114
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

115
But wouldn't you date him?

116
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

117
- Hey.
- Agh. Thought you were Rachel.

118
- What gave me away?
- I gotta tell her.

119
Get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

120
It's official.
We're moving in together.

121
No turning back.

122
Are you scared? Are you?

123
No.

124
That was my scariest voice. You're brave.

125
- Hey. Ugh.
- Hey.

126
The worst day.

127
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

128
First four years of my work,
they called me...

129
- Seriously.
- I believe you.

130
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

131
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

132
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

133
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

134
What?

135
All yours, babe.

136
Rachel, come here.

137
Have a seat.

138
Okay.

139
Listen, um, Chandler and I...

140
...are going to live together.

141
Here.

142
Oh, my God.

143
That's so great!

144
I'm so happy for you guys!

145
Really?

146
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

147
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

148
Yes, we are.

149
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take...

150
...because you know
Racquel can't be late.

151
- Rach.
- He'll work on that.

152
Oh. Aw, this is so exciting!

153
Oh, wow.

154
Come and knock on our door

155
We'll be waiting for you

156
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

157
First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality.
Not my fault.

158
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

159
A little my fault.

160
Third marriage:
They shouldn't let you get married...

161
...when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

162
Nevada's fault.

163
So, what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

164
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

165
But not while he's still married.

166
And you, wouldn't you want a date?

167
I'm not dating at all anymore.

168
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

169
So I decided that until I work that...

170
Good. Good. Whatever.

171
What about you, Meg?

172
Well, I don't care about
the divorces either.

173
But I wouldn't date him.

174
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

175
What?

176
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl."

177
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

178
And I have loved her in the past...

179
...but now, she is just my wife.

180
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

181
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

182
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

183
Hey! You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

184
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

185
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

186
Yes, and now he's using
this three-divorces reason...

187
...because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

188
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

189
Okay, fine. If this is what you think...

190
...forget about the whole
three-divorce thing.

191
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled. Okay?

192
She means nothing to me.

193
Noth... Nothing!

194
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

195
I am so attracted to him right now.

196
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

197
Soon.

198
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

199
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

200
Joey's my best friend.

201
I'm not your best friend?

202
You just said...!

203
Ugh.

204
Of course, you're my best friend.

205
Would you tell Rachel?

206
- All right. At least I'm prepared.
- Okay.

207
- Oh, yes.
- Hey!

208
Hey, hey.

209
- They're not for you. Are you upset?
- I am now.

210
Hey, roomie.

211
Okay, bye.

212
Rach. Ahem.

213
There's something, um,
important I have to tell you.

214
Are you pregnant?

215
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

216
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

217
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

218
When I said that, uh, Chandler and I
wanted to live together...

219
...we meant alone together.

220
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

221
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

222
I wasn't clear.

223
I'm really sorry.

224
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

225
There's absolutely no rush.

226
Okay.

227
Don't you want a cookie?

228
Sure.

229
Thanks.

230
Do you need a tissue?

231
Mm-hm.

232
- Where did you get these?
- I made them.

233
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

234
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

235
No more Joey and Chan's.

236
No more J and C's.

237
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

238
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

239
We won't be able in the night
and have those long talks...

240
...about our feelings and the future.

241
Not once did we do that.

242
- Hi.
- Hey.

243
So I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

244
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

245
Really well. Yeah.

246
Surprisingly well.

247
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

248
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

249
All I'm asking for is a little emotion.

250
Is that too much to ask after six years?

251
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?

252
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

253
When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.

254
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!

255
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

256
No more J-Man and Channy's!

257
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

258
You got married again?

259
Yes.

260
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

261
Yes. Second in two years.

262
Third, overall.

263
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years...

264
...and never have I had
so much business from one client.

265
Why don't you tell me what happened?

266
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

267
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said...

268
...at the altar
in the second marriage?

269
Yes, yes, yes. Heh.

270
But I do not love her.

271
Oh.

272
That's better then.

273
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

274
I see.

275
Have you considered therapy?

276
I think just the annulment for today.

277
- There are some forms to fill out.
- Easy.

278
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

279
No problem. Heh.

280
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

281
Ooh.

282
There's no way to do this without her?

283
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

284
Of course you did.

285
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

286
Uh-huh.

287
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

288
I will think about the therapy.

289
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
So, um, I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

291
Okay.

292
No point in dragging it out.

293
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...

294
...and us not living together anymore.

295
Okay.

296
- Hey, Rach.
- Yeah?

297
What about this? Who gets this?

298
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

299
- What is that?
- I don't know.

300
Rachel.

301
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

302
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

303
Something to remember me by.

304
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

305
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

306
But still, it's a big change.

307
The end of an era, you might say.

308
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

309
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

310
Oh, all right.

311
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

312
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

313
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

314
- What is the matter with you?
- What is the matter with you?

315
Why aren't you more upset?

316
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

317
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

318
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

319
It's just a little hard to believe.

320
What's hard to believe?

321
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

322
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

323
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

324
Rachel.

325
It's going to happen.

326
Chandler is gonna move in here.

327
- But I...
- No, wait. Just let me finish, okay?

328
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

329
This is something
that we both really want.

330
And it is going to happen.

331
It is?

332
Really?

333
Yeah, sweetie.

334
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

335
No.

336
Well...

337
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

338
I'm gonna miss you.

339
I mean, it's the end of an era!

340
I know!

341
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, no.

342
So did you get the annulment?

343
- I couldn't.
- I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

344
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated...

345
Complicated because of the love.

346
I do not love Rachel.

347
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...

348
...so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

349
Would I do that if I loved her?

350
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

351
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

352
Oh, what's wrong?

353
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...

354
...and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

355
Oh, my, come here, come here.
It's okay.

356
Aw, everything's gonna be okay.

357
Thank you.

358
Of course.

359
So Ross and Rachel got married.

360
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

361
You think you and I should hook up?

362
Oh, we do. Ha, ha.

363
But not just yet.

364
Really? Well, when?

365
Okay. Um.

366
Ahem, well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married...

367
...and be filthy rich, by the way.

368
- But it won't work out.
- Wow.

369
I know.

370
Then I'm gonna marry Chandler
for the money.

371
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

372
Great.

373
But then we ditch those two
and we get married.

374
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

375
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

376
Ooh, ooh, what about Ross?

377
I don't want to go into the whole thing,
but, um...

378
...we have words and I kill him.

﻿1
"We've got three minutes
till the reactor blows.

2
We'll never make it!"

3
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!"

4
"No, I won't leave you."

5
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"

6
- "No, you're not. Not to me."
- Oh, my God.

7
- What?
- I am extremely talented.

8
- Yeah. You're great.
- Yeah.

9
- Okay, let's take it from...
- No, I was really acting my ass off.

10
I thought I was pretty good too.

11
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

12
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

13
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.
Ha-ha-ha.

14
Fine. I'll do it without you!

15
I don't need you or anybody else!

16
I'm gonna make it on my own!

17
You'll see! You'll all see!

18
So, what's this thing
you're auditioning for?

19
It's a new TV show. Yeah.

20
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

21
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with the help of my robot partner.

22
He's a computerized, humanoid...

23
...electronically enhanced
secret enforcer.

24
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."

25
- So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S. E?
- That's the title!

26
They really lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

27
That is lucky.

28
Huh. So, Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

29
...the star of your own TV show.

30
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

31
Don't get your hopes up,
because it's probably not gonna happen.

32
Now, why would you say that, Joseph?

33
Well, I mean, come on, you guys.
My own TV show?

34
- I don't know if I'm good enough.
- I am. Heh.

35
What are you talking about?
You're a terrific actor.

36
- You really think so?
- How can you even ask that question?

37
- She's pretty.
- Yeah. And she's really nice too.

38
She taught me all about, you know,
how to work with cameras...

39
...and "smell the fart" acting.

40
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?
- Excuse me?

41
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

42
...that sometimes you need a minute
to remember your next one.

43
So while you're thinking of it, you take
this big pause where you look all intense.

44
You know, like this:

45
- Oh.
- Okay.

46
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

47
Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

48
You sister is suffering from a...

49
Well, Eva,
we've done some excellent work here.

50
And I would have to say,
your problem is quite clear.

51
All you want is a dinkle

52
What you envy's a schwang

53
A thing through which you can tinkle

54
Or play with or simply let hang

55
I play Al Pacino's butt.

56
All right? He goes into the shower
and then, I'm his butt.

57
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, you guys.

58
This is a real movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

59
No, it's terrific. You deserve this
after all your years of struggling...

60
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

61
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

62
- No, you're right, it is.
- Yeah.

63
So, you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

64
All right, I'm out of here.
Wish me luck.

65
Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck

66
Yeah, whatever.

67
It's your turn.

68
Oh, are we playing this?

69
- Hey.
- Hey. How did the audition go?

70
Terrible. I messed up every line.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

71
Wait. Are you doing that thing
where you pretend it didn't go well...

72
...but it really did go well?

73
- Yeah, did I fool you?
- Totally!

74
- So, it did go well?
- It went amazingly well!

75
- Great.
- That's great.

76
- It's down to me and two other guys.
- Oh, my God.

77
I know both of them,
and they're really good.

78
One's from those allergy commercials
who's always being chased...

79
...by those big flowers.
- Oh, I love that guy.

80
Oh. What are you doing?

81
What am I doing?

82
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't till tomorrow at 5.

83
I feel like my head's gonna explode.

84
Well, it is overdue.

85
Don't worry, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

86
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.

87
No offense, but what you guys all do
is very different.

88
I don't know if you'd understand.

89
Yeah, none of the rest of us
have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

90
Yes, I know what time it is...

91
...but I'm looking at the WENIS
and I'm not happy.

92
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

93
- Uh-huh? Is it dirty?
- No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

94
Don't. I like it dirty.

95
That's your call.

96
So, uh, what are you
going to do next?

97
Well, I thought
that I would cut up the tomatoes.

98
Are they firm?

99
They're all right.

100
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?

101
No, really. They're okay.

102
You gonna slice them up real nice?

103
Ahem. Actually,
I was gonna do them julienne.

104
I'm out of here.

105
Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81 -year-old woman put on a thong...

106
...and she didn't even buy it.

107
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

108
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

109
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

110
Well, what happened?

111
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until...

112
Oh, my God.

113
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

114
- Was it?
- Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

115
You ate my sandwich.

116
It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

117
Oh, really?

118
Now calm down.

119
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

120
- What?
- Well, it was quite large.

121
I had to throw most of it away.

122
You threw my sandwich away?

123
My sandwich?

124
My sandwich!

125
It's just, I want this part so much,
you know?

126
If I don't get this part, I'm never
gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.

127
No, I didn't say that.
That doesn't count.

128
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

129
I just moved across the hall.

130
And we would have you over
all the time...

131
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

132
You're right, I could never lie to you.

133
She hates you.

134
Should I get that? Ha-ha-ha.

135
Hello? Uh, no,
Joey's not here right now.

136
Can I take a message?

137
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
been moved from 5 to 2:30?

138
Okay, great. Bye.

139
- Aren't you dressed yet?
- Am I naked again?

140
We're supposed to meet my parents
in 15 minutes.

141
Okay. I was just talking to the guys.
Just look at them.

142
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?

143
What about my allergies?

144
Right. Your allergies.

145
All her. She hates you.

146
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

147
Yes! All right.

148
How cool would it be if you could watch
like a real life-size version of this?

149
- I mean, how crazy would that be?
- As crazy as soccer?

150
Hello?

151
What are you talking about?
The audition's not till 5.

152
Well, nobody told me.

153
Who'd you talk to?

154
Never mind.

155
You mean you didn't get it from this?

156
The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.

157
Maybe we can fix it, you know?

158
Maybe we can send him
some big, big flowers and scare him!

159
How could you do this to me?

160
This part could've turned
my whole career around.

161
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

162
You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?

163
- I have a machine!
- Which I bought for you.

164
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

165
If there was anything I could do,
I would do it, okay?

166
But everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

167
He could have gotten me a VCR.
He could have gotten me golf clubs.

168
But no, he has to get me
the "woman repeller."

169
The eyesore
from the "Liberace House of Crap!"

170
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

171
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T Collection."

172
Chandler. Chandler.

173
I pity the fool
who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!

174
I pity the fool that...

175
Hi...

176
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

177
...and one thing led to another and...

178
And what? Did you sleep with her?

179
- No! No, I just kissed her.
- What? That's even worse!

180
- How is that worse?
- I don't know! But it's the same!

181
You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

182
"Over the line?"

183
You're so far past the line
that you can't even see the line!

184
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!

185
I'm not saying that you should
magically forgive me.

186
But you're not perfect. You've made
some errors in judgment too.

187
Name one.

188
What happened?

189
Aw, man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

190
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

191
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

192
This guy came by to look at the unit...

193
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

194
So you got in voluntarily?

195
I was trying to make a sale!

196
Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

197
Bend over?

198
There's Lorraine.

199
Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

200
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

201
Well, well. Look what you brought.

202
And what did you bring?

203
She's checking her coat.

204
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

205
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

206
Janice?

207
Oh, my God!

208
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

209
What?

210
No way. I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

211
He said he was gonna do my inseam...

212
...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

213
What?

214
Cupping.

215
That's how they do pants!

216
Ross, will you tell him?

217
- Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
- Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

218
I said name one!

219
- I can't believe I did this. What an idiot.
- Stop beating yourself up.

220
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

221
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me, are there?

222
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

223
- Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
- Of course he will.

224
Chandler, the most important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

225
- You know what, I kind of have.
- Already?

226
That was pretty bad, what you did.

227
You know what? He will forgive you.

228
I like to bring a pad with me when I go
answer the phone, just in case. Okay.

229
You didn't see how mad he was,
you know?

230
I'm sure he will forgive you.

231
Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.

232
That's the way it works.

233
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

234
Yeah! You and that girl
from the copy place...

235
...which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!

236
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

237
I didn't finish the whole letter.

238
- What?
- I fell asleep.

239
You fell asleep?

240
It was 5:30 in the morning.

241
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

242
Front and back!

243
And by the way? Y-O-U,
apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

244
Y-O-U-R means "your."

245
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

246
We are so over!

247
Fine by me!

248
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

249
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

250
I knew it!

251
- You had no right to go out with him.
- That is the most ridiculous...

252
- You sold me out!
- I did not sell you out!

253
- Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me...
- Would you let me talk?

254
Did you just flick me?

255
Okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish
and I was just... Ow!

256
- Stop it! Ow!
- Ow!

257
- Stop.
- Stop.

258
- All right. No, let's not do this.
- No!

259
- Happy thoughts.
- No!

260
- Stop it!
- Oh! Oh!

261
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

262
- Ow!
- Ow!

263
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- I know, I know.

264
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

265
- Fine.
- Fine.

266
There we go.

267
Ha. You know what? If we were in prison,
you guys would be like my bitches.

268
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

269
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearing everything you own.

270
Oh, my God!

271
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

272
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando."

273
Whew. I tell you, it's hot with all this
stuff on. I'd better not do any lunges.

274
Joey?

275
Got you the Joey special. Two pizzas!

276
Joe?

277
Hello? Damn it!

278
Hello?

279
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

280
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

281
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

282
Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

283
Yes!

284
Okay.

285
Mac...

286
...audition...

287
...at 2.

288
Allergy...

289
...actor...

290
...attacked.

291
By dog...

292
...not...

293
...flowers.

294
- Hey.
- Please tell me you got the message.

295
- What message?
- The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.

296
- They needed to see you at 2:00.
- What? It's 6:00!

297
Look! I wrote it!
I wrote it on the board!

298
I wrote it on the board,
then went looking all over for you!

299
I went to Ross's, the coffee house.

300
I went to any place
that they make sandwiches!

301
- I can't believe this, Chandler!
- I'm sorry.

302
I don't know what to say!

303
You might say, "Congratulations."

304
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

305
Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.

306
- I'm sorry.
- At times that fake-out thing is mean.

307
Okay, man. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.

308
Well, that's good.

309
Because you didn't.
And I'm incredibly happy for you!

310
That's mean!

311
- You had me going there!
- We could do this all day.

312
Yeah, you're right.

313
Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

314
You are gonna be a huge star.
I'm gonna hug you.

315
- You hug me.
- All right.

316
- Do we do this too much?
- I think so.

317
- Yeah. Get off me.
- Yeah.

318
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

319
Try routing your backup power source
through your primary CPU."

320
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"

321
Wow.

322
"Well, then I'll just have to carry you."

323
"That'll be a neat trick...

324
...when you're dead!"

325
Ross, you don't have to yell.

326
There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.

327
I thought you were excellent.

328
In fact, for a minute there, I was like,
"Ooh, where did Ross go?"

329
Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac...

330
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. I mean...

331
You know what?

332
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

333
- Holding us back.
- Totally.

﻿1
- Okay, Chandler.
- Okay.

2
And your horoscope says:

3
"On the 5th, a special someone
is going to give you a gift."

4
- Oh, well, thank you in advance. Mm.
- Ha, ha.

5
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

6
You're going to make a joke
about my special present.

7
Why would you do that?

8
Oh, wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

9
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

10
Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11
That's right. It's your first day.

12
Are you psyched to fight fake crime
with your robot sidekick?

13
Am I psyched?
The lead in my own TV series?

14
I've dreamed about this for years.

15
Why have I not been preparing?

16
No, Joey, you're gonna be great.

17
But I gotta act with a robot.
I don't know anything about technology.

18
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

19
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

20
Our lover's spat will start
a little early this month.

21
I'll be waiting.

22
Are you judging them by their covers?
Because you're really not supposed to.

23
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to start writing another book.

24
Because the last one
was such a big seller?

25
Well, if you must know,
I have written 14 books.

26
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

27
...I can tell you that
they have all been very well received.

28
- Hey.
- Hey.

29
- Hi.
- What are you doing later?

30
Oh, Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

31
- We do?
- I want to see what he wants first.

32
I just found out Elizabeth's dad
wants to meet me.

33
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

34
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

35
Come on, guys.
I really want this guy to like me.

36
It would really help me out
if you guys could be here...

37
...to make me look good.
- Of course we'll help.

38
- We'll be here.
- Thanks.

39
We know how tough
those parent-teacher conferences can be.

40
- So here's your office set.
- Wow, huh?

41
Mac Machiavelli, Private Investigator.
Eh?

42
- Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting.
- Okay.

43
Hey, uh, when do I meet the robot?

44
Why don't we do that right now?
He's right here.

45
- Okay.
- Joey Tribbiani, this is...

46
Wow! He's so lifelike.

47
Unbelievable.

48
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

49
How do you do there, buddy?

50
- I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
- Okay.

51
Sorry about that.

52
- Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S. E?
- C.H.E.E.S.E. Is right here.

53
Nice to meet you, Mac.

54
- This is the temporary robot, right?
- No. Why?

55
Well, I just thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

56
Like the Terminator,
or, uh, when I first saw you.

57
I spent two years developing this
machine. It's absolutely state of the art.

58
I'm sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

59
It can do this.

60
Hey... Oh, ha, ha.

61
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

62
It's great to meet you, Paul.

63
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
to address me as Mr. Stevens.

64
Uh, of course. Mr. Stevens.

65
Good. So, Ross...

66
...what's your problem?

67
Excuse me?

68
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

69
Heh. It's funny...

70
Um, it's not funny.

71
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

72
Okay, um, I can see that.

73
But I think if you give me, um, one chance,
I can change your mind.

74
- Okay.
- What?

75
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

76
You've got one minute.

77
- Daddy.
- Fine.

78
Two minutes. Go.

79
A minute and 50 seconds.

80
Okay, um...

81
I want you to know, I have never
done anything like this before.

82
I mean, I've been in, um,
relationships in general.

83
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not...

84
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

85
Uh... We, I mean...
I mean, we've done stuff...

86
Okay. Okay. A joke.
A joke. Lighten the mood.

87
Um, two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.

88
- I'm Irish.
- And the Irish guy wins the joke.

89
- Ross?
- Ross!

90
- How crazy that we would run into you.
- Oh, my God! Thank you.

91
Um, uh...

92
Mr. Stevens,
I'd like you to meet my friends.

93
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.

94
So you're Elizabeth's father, huh?
I can see now where she gets her...

95
...rugged handsomeness.

96
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

97
There's a Mr. Bing!

98
No, unfortunately, Lizzie's mom
passed away shortly after she was born.

99
- I raised her by myself.
- Oh...

100
I get that a lot.

101
Okay, um, why don't we all
take a seat, you know? Heh.

102
And, uh, I'll get us all
some, uh, coffees.

103
Yeah, why don't you... Ahem. Uh...

104
And you guys can talk about
whatever you want.

105
Whatever pops into your head.

106
It is so strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

107
...because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

108
Yeah. But not looking for dates.

109
So, um, Monica is Ross' sister.

110
He's a great brother!

111
- I had a sister.
- Oh.

112
- She passed away.
- Oh...

113
You don't have to do that every time.

114
But, uh, Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

115
Funny story, heh, ha, ha...

116
Your roommate in college died,
didn't he?

117
A part of him did, yes.

118
Okay! Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

119
I hope you guys were finding
something to talk about.

120
- Yes. We were just...
- Sorry I'm late.

121
But I am ready, ready to talk you up. Heh.

122
- When does Liz's father get here?
- I'm already here.

123
Oh, Ross is so great.

124
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
You said we'd get the kind with the baby.

125
- You said the baby creeps you out.
- The little girl creeps me out.

126
- You said the baby.
- Why would the baby creep me out?

127
Why would the little girl
creep you out?

128
I'm sorry.
Can you please talk a little slower.

129
- This is for your book?
- It's about relationships.

130
You know, the traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

131
- Keep going. This stuff's great.
- What?

132
Excuse me.

133
And how none of it matters
when the people really love each other.

134
And how people will believe anything you
tell them as long as it's a compliment.

135
- Oh, hi! Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

136
- I left my keys here somewhere.
- Oh, well, let's look for them.

137
Under here... Oh, hey!

138
Hey! Are these them?

139
No.

140
- All right.
- Oh.

141
- Here they are.
- Good.

142
- Thanks for your help.
- Wait! Sorry!

143
- Mr. Paul?
- Just call me Paul.

144
Paul. Um,
I just wanted you to know that...

145
...you know, Ross really is a great guy.

146
Maybe you could date him then. It
would save me the trouble of killing him.

147
Are you okay?

148
You just don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

149
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

150
- Ah. We?
- Yeah, it usually takes two people to...

151
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that.

152
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

153
I'm just me. Yeah.

154
My wife died shortly
after Lizzie was born.

155
Oh.

156
- So you raised her all on your own?
- Yes, I did.

157
Oh...

158
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
- How was your first day?
- Great.

160
Except I got a little attitude
from the robot.

161
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

162
It wasn't the robot,
it was the guy who controls him.

163
He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
Knock over the sandwich table...

164
...right when I was reaching for one. Ugh.

165
Why don't you get him fired?

166
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

167
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

168
Excuse me.

169
Joey Tribbiani.

170
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

171
- Wow.
- The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.

172
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

173
It's the lead in a series.

174
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

175
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

176
Uh-oh.

177
Joey?

178
Hi, Ross.

179
I was just getting him to like you.

180
Joey?

181
- Joey!
- Hey, Ross.

182
Ross, Joey is not here.

183
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!

184
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

185
Yeah, Ross. It's okay. It's me...

186
...Mr. Stevens.

187
Oh, I didn't... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

188
Sure you did. You came in,
got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.

189
You were shouting, "Joey, Joey!"

190
- Bye, Rachel.
- Bye.

191
- I'll call you later.
- Okay. See you!

192
- Bye, Ross.
- Ah, hoo. Ha, ha.

193
What? What the...? How did...? What?

194
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

195
In your mouth?

196
No.

197
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

198
...for two hours. I really liked him.
I invited him for a cup of coffee.

199
You were at the coffee house!

200
Ross, what's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.

201
He's my girlfriend's father. Okay?
It's weird!

202
- You dated my sister.
- That was different!

203
- What? Why?
- This is weird for me!

204
Ross, look. This is good for you, okay?

205
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.

206
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

207
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

208
Plus the guy is a very,
very successful lawyer.

209
- How is that important?
- Oh, it's important.

210
There's a million guys
out there who can play Mac...

211
...and there's only one robot.

212
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

213
- What am I gonna do?
- Well, Joey.

214
You're a pretty charming guy.

215
Thanks. But I have a
problem to deal with.

216
No, sweetie. You've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

217
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

218
That's not a bad idea!

219
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,
I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.

220
Oh, actually I got a little bit
saved for you, Pheebs.

221
So do you think, uh,
Joey is more charming than me?

222
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

223
Yeah, you wish.

224
- "You wish."
- Phoebe, stop writing about us.

225
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

226
- Who?
- Marsha and Chester.

227
Okay, fine. Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

228
- Hmm.
- Huh.

229
- "Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
- I see what you're doing.

230
- "Phyllis sees what I'm doing."
- Oh, ho.

231
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter.

232
Morning! Hey!

233
How's my favorite genius
and his robot buddy?

234
- Don't touch him!
- Okay. All right. Um...

235
Wayne, level with me. I keep hearing
all these rumors that I might get fired.

236
They even have actors coming in
to read for my part.

237
Come on, man.
You gotta give me a second chance.

238
I love this little guy... Aah.

239
Okay. That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right? There you go.

240
Stupid! I can't believe this! God.

241
Hey, how are you doing?

242
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

243
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

244
- What a nice story.
- Heh.

245
So Ross was in college...

246
...and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

247
Wow. I definitely did
not see that one backfiring.

248
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Yeah. Take your time.

249
Just so you know, I was a freshman and
she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as...

250
Ross, look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

251
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

252
...and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

253
I have to admit that after all
the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...

254
...and the many, many, many
stories that Rachel has told me...

255
...that, well...

256
...you're not...

257
...all bad.

258
"Not all bad."

259
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

260
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

261
You know, I know what you mean.
I do that, too.

262
- I beg your pardon?
- No! I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.

263
I mean, I have a son who's, um, 6,
and I still think of him as a baby.

264
- You have a son?
- Yeah. My ex-wife and I...

265
...uh, share custody of Ben. And, uh...

266
Just so you know,
Carol and I are on excellent terms...

267
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.

268
Oh! I'm sorry.

269
It's unbelievable!

270
Don't worry.
I just didn't realize you were married.

271
Oh, we were. But that was just a...

272
I mean, that was just
a big drunken mistake.

273
You're back.

274
You two were married?

275
Oh, whoops. I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.

276
We said we would meet
at the coffee house at 6:00.

277
- We said 7:00.
- We said 6:00!

278
The only way that I said 6:00...

279
...would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

280
If I had said 7:00, I would have
said something like:

281
- "Wow, my boyfriend
is such a wiseass. -00!"

282
- Hi!
- Oh, my good God!

283
- I know what time you said.
- What?

284
Well, actually I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

285
- What time?
- Quite an interesting turn of events.

286
Suddenly it's my book
to the rescue, huh? Let's see.

287
Ooh. Very interesting.

288
Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.

289
- What does it say?
- I will tell you...

290
...as soon as you thank me
for writing my book.

291
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

292
...and you are the queen of everything.

293
Thanks. So are you.

294
I told you I should not wear this color.

295
"Monica... Marsha and Chester are
planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.

296
"Marsha thinks they're supposed to
meet at 6:00.

297
Chester thinks it's at 7:00."

298
- You knew we would miss the movie?
- That's right.

299
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

300
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."

301
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.

302
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

303
Yeah. Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

304
Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.

305
Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.
I hate you. You ruined my life.

306
- Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
- Hi. How are you?

307
Joey, I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

308
Why should I help you out?

309
- The reason he just said.
- What do you need?

310
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

311
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

312
- Are you in love with her?
- Yeah.

313
Her. All of them. Anyone.

314
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

315
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...

316
...if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.

317
Oh, Wayne, it's not something you can
teach. It's something you're born with...

318
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

319
I mean, if you think about it...

320
...Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

321
- How to make the next one even shorter?
- Oh.

322
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

323
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.

324
He just didn't tell me.

325
Maybe I have to pee again.

326
Well, this is fun.

327
So Ross...

328
...did you kill any of these wives?

329
You know what? I...

330
I have had enough of this.
I care a great deal about your daughter.

331
And I have treated her
with nothing but respect.

332
- So if you've got a problem with me...
- Are you yelling at me?

333
God, no.

334
You know what, Daddy?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.

335
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm gonna go out with him anyway.

336
Really?

337
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

338
...it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.

339
Well, what can I say?

340
This doesn't make me like you better.

341
That's okay. I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

342
- Then we agree?
- Yeah, I guess so.

343
- Neither of us like Ross.
- I like Ross.

344
Oh, heh, kids!

345
Wait. I just thought of another story
about how nice Ross is.

346
That's okay, Rach.
We're not liking Ross right now.

347
- Oh! Well, I got a lot of those, too.
- Uh...

348
Well, it turns out you were right,
C.H.E.E.S.E.

349
- That shipment never made it to Omaha?
- You got it.

350
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horse hair.

351
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

352
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

353
Wayne! Wayne!

﻿1
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

2
What's the matter?

3
Well, it's just... It's one
of these situations that I just hate.

4
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...

5
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
No. No, it's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.

8
- I'll give up my ticket.
- Me too.

9
Okay. That's so generous.

10
And I think Ross is generous too.

11
Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.

12
- Great.
- Yeah.

13
So, what is the exhibit?

14
It's mostly just photographs...

15
...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
Oh, man.

17
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi there.

18
Hey, Ross, listen.

19
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
Thanks? But I have plans.
Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

22
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.

23
Why? What?

24
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
- Uh-oh.
- Ha, ha.

26
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

27
You know, let it go. Stop it.

28
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.

29
So, uh, he's much older than she is.

30
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils. Huh?

31
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.

32
Okay, okay.

33
Uh, well, Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?

34
- Ross?
- Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?

35
Because he's got, like, a hearing aid,
you know?

36
Because he's all old.

37
One second.

38
Okay, look, Ross.

39
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

40
...I accept the fact
that you're going out with her.

41
Really? Okay, that's great.

42
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.

43
I'm funny like that.

44
So I've told Lizzie
and now I'm telling you.

45
I don't want you seeing
my daughter anymore.

46
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.

47
Yes, it does.

48
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

49
...and so I don't think there's really
anything you can do about it.

50
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.

51
Oh, a man with a plan.

52
This is so exciting. You get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

53
I know. It was so cool
when it was up there before.

54
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

55
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

56
Now he's just laughing at me.

57
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.

58
Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...

59
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.

60
Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.

61
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.

62
- Hey. So I'm back.
- Who are you?

63
Joey Tribbiani.

64
From the wall?

65
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory, huh?

66
Huh?

67
Okay, anyway.

68
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
- Show me in the TV book.
- Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.

70
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?

72
So, um, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes here?

73
Maybe just ones
that haven't been cleaned yet?

74
God.

75
I love museums.

76
- Soaking up all the culture.
- Yeah.

77
- Where do you want to start?
- Ooh, the gift shop.

78
Yeah.

79
- Hey, and then lunch.
- Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.

80
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

81
Ow, wow. What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?

82
What? No, why?

83
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

84
You could put the aisle over here
and then have the wedding ceremony here.

85
I didn't know
you could get married here.

86
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

87
Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.

88
You'd have the ceremony
under this big, beautiful arch.

89
May I help you?

90
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.

91
- Do you do a lot of weddings here?
- Yes, we're very popular.

92
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.

93
Monica, you should totally put
your name down for this place.

94
What? Are you crazy?

95
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

96
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

97
Then you've gotta wait
another two years for this place?

98
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

99
He's gonna find somebody else,
you know?

100
- Someone who put their name on the list.
- Mm-hm.

101
Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt
to put your name down.

102
If in two years you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

103
Well, I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

104
- I'm gonna do it too.
- Me too.

105
Really? Who would you marry?

106
I don't know.
I don't have anyone right now, you know?

107
Oh, Pheebs.

108
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

109
- Phoebe, that's not...
- Don't even get me started on yours.

110
Hey.

111
- So, did you watch the tape of my show?
- I did.

112
- All right. Let's get me back up there.
- No. You don't go up on the wall.

113
- What? But you saw the show.
- Yes. It was very offensive to my people.

114
Dry cleaners?

115
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

116
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.

117
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

118
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing.

119
Okay, well, that may be true.

120
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil.

121
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

122
- I've never seen it.
- Oh, you should. It's great.

123
This place is really beautiful.

124
Yeah. I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

125
Wow. The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.

126
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

127
But people say that my eyes look...

128
- Do you want to make out?
- Sure. Ha, ha.

129
Are you okay?

130
- What's wrong?
- Uh...

131
Yeah, I was just thinking
about your father.

132
- Well, whatever works for you.
- No.

133
No, no. Uh, he just really
freaked me out before.

134
Oh.

135
Well, so we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

136
Big deal.
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

137
Yeah.

138
- Hey.
- Yeah.

139
Um, you brought protection, right?

140
Why? Are there, like, bears
or something?

141
- No.
- Oh, uh...

142
Oh, protection, yeah.
No. That I forgot.

143
Ha, ha. I'll just run to the store
and get some.

144
No. Hey, hey. I'm the guy. I'll get it.

145
- Do you know where the store is?
- No.

146
Do you want to ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

147
A little bit.

148
- I'll be back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

149
Why don't you get in the hot tub
and I'll meet you there.

150
Oh, okay.

151
Oh, my God. What a great
surprise. This is such a beautiful house.

152
Thank you. It used to be
my mother's. So this is the kitchen.

153
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

154
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

155
Yeah, we are.

156
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

157
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

158
I want to let her know
there was a cancellation.

159
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

160
...it is available.

161
This is Chandler Bing.
This is Chandler Bing.

162
Yes, the groom. No, not the groom!

163
It's so secluded up here.

164
- I know. That's why I like it here.
- Mm-hm.

165
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

166
Whoops. Sorry.

167
What's the matter, honey?

168
- Did you see a little mouse?
- No. Big bear. Big bear outside.

169
I think I...

170
Actually, would you go check on that?

171
Honey, we don't have any bears here.

172
Well, okay.

173
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

174
- Okay. Be right back.
- Okay.

175
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

176
- I came with Paul.
- Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

177
Hurry up. Get out.

178
Here you go, honey.

179
- Ah. Thank you.
- Diet Coke.

180
Oh. Ice.

181
I need ice.

182
Okay.

183
- Thank you.
- Be right back.

184
Okay.

185
- You and your ice.
- Oh.

186
Get out. Get out. Go. Come on.

187
Quick.

188
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
- Did you really hear a bear?
- Go!

190
Here you go, honey.

191
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
Oh, thank you.

193
I am so happy that you're here.

194
- Here I am.
- Elizabeth.

195
Oh, look. Elizabeth's here.

196
Who were you talking to?

197
You guys?

198
How did you know we were here?

199
- Um...
- Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks...

200
...that were leading up
to the closed garage.

201
Obviously. Heh.

202
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?

203
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

204
Yeah. Yeah.

205
Well, why don't you, you know,
go in that room and do your homework?

206
Oh, I wouldn't do it in there.
Um, that's my dad's bedroom.

207
That's your dad's bedroom.

208
Ha, ha. That's your dad's bedroom.

209
Ho-ho.

210
- Why are you yelling?
- Oh!

211
That Diet Coke, I think,
went straight to my head. Whoo!

212
Hi, honey.

213
See you later.

214
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

215
Well, next time, ask.

216
Or at least wait for me to ask.

217
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

218
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

219
Oh, no.

220
I wanna let her know
there's been a cancellation.

221
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

222
...it is available.

223
Please. He didn't hear it.

224
This is Chandler Bing.
This is Chandler Bing.

225
No!

226
Can I help you?

227
Uh, yeah. Where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

228
- He's not here right now.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

229
All right, well, make sure you tell him that
Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.

230
Okay? I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture up there on the wall.

231
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

232
Oh, really?

233
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.

234
You're the other one, right?

235
So, Lizzie, are you planning
on staying the night?

236
Oh, no, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

237
Good, good. Not that we don't want you
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.

238
How much more homework
do you have?

239
Uh, I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

240
Uh, Rachel, maybe you want to
come upstairs and help me figure it out?

241
Really?

242
Okay.

243
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

244
...if you get me something from the car.

245
What do you need from the car?

246
Surprise me.

247
- Okay.
- Okay.

248
So you're gonna be in the car.
I will be upstairs.

249
And that's where everybody's gonna be.

250
Just relax. Just relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

251
She likes you. She...

252
I think she likes you. She likes you.

253
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

254
You are the man.

255
Still got it.

256
Still sexy.

257
You're just a love machine.

258
I'm just a love machine

259
So proud of what you have, baby

260
Showtime.

261
I'm just a love machine
Hey, baby

262
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

263
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

264
The woman from the museum called
and said that there was a cancellation...

265
...and we could move up our wedding.
Chandler heard.

266
I know. How bad is this?

267
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God.

268
I know. I know. He totally freaked out
and I can't find him anywhere.

269
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm never listening to you again, for sure.

270
"What harm can it do
to put your name down?"

271
- Rachel said that.
- Well, Rachel's not here!

272
Ooh, here it is.

273
Ooh, Joey, why did you sign it,
"son of a bitch"?

274
- I didn't do that. Who would've done that?
- Son of a bitch.

275
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

276
You. Get out of my shop.

277
- What did he do?
- He went out with my wife.

278
- Joey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

279
Hey, I did not go out with your wife.
Okay?

280
- I went out with her.
- That's my wife.

281
Get out!

282
- Well, we should go.
- Yeah.

283
Ross?

284
Elizabeth.

285
Okay. Okay.
I'm gonna go out this window.

286
I'll meet you at the front door.

287
- Just tell them you're going home, okay?
- Okay.

288
Wait, wait. No, don't go in there.

289
Don't go in there. I need another soda.

290
Ross.

291
Oh, my God. Ross, what in heaven's name
are you doing here?

292
And that is why we cannot
see each other anymore.

293
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

294
- Daddy, I...
- You're next.

295
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

296
Let me just see if I got this straight.

297
I tell you to stay away from my daughter
or I'll have you fired.

298
What you heard was:
"Take my daughter...

299
...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

300
- Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
- No. Let me explain. Fired.

301
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

302
But, uh, I want you to know...

303
...that you and I are not all that different.
I mean...

304
...l, too, am a neat guy.

305
What?

306
And I, too...

307
...am just a love machine.

308
Ross.

309
Let me show you
where the guest room is.

310
I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.

311
I'm not freaking out.

312
Why would I freak out?

313
A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.

314
But that happens every day. Ah-ah-ah!

315
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.

316
And I just put our names down for fun.

317
- I mean, what's the harm in that?
- Right here.

318
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

319
- Phoebe and Rachel just thought...
- Phoebe and Rachel?

320
So the people that knew
about our wedding before me were you...

321
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy...

322
...and apparently some band called
Star Light Magic Seven...

323
...who are available, by the way.

324
It was a mistake.

325
Please don't take this to mean anything,
because it doesn't.

326
Okay.

327
Really?

328
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm just not ready.

329
I know.

330
Okay.

331
All right.

332
Now, I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.

333
We were really worried about you.

334
- Hey, did she buy it?
- Totally.

335
- So did Hildy show you the place?
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

336
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica
to marry you.

337
I know.

338
- Hey, Gunther.
- Take these cappuccinos to Table 11.

339
And that guy over there wants
some biscotti.

340
Oh. Well, I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee to go.

341
Do you still work here?

342
No, no. I quit a long time ago.

343
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.

344
- Oh, it's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
- Great.

﻿1
Can you help me pick
an engagement ring for Monica?

2
I can't figure this out. It's so hard.

3
Should I get her a Tiffany cut,
or a princess cut or a...

4
Ow! Paper cut!

5
Have you told anyone else?

6
No, I don't want to tell anybody.
I don't want Monica to find out.

7
You told me.

8
Well, that's because I trust you,
and we're best friends...

9
...and you walked in on me
while I was looking at ring brochures.

10
Well, once again, not knocking pays off.

11
- I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
- Me too.

12
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
- Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
- Oh, all right.

14
Oh, perfect. We were just gonna see
if you wanted to go.

15
Oh, well, we don't,
because we got the other place.

16
How rude.

17
Oh, I'm sorry. You want a bite?

18
So how are things going with Paul?

19
- Good.
- Huh.

20
- Although, you know, he's a private guy.
- Mm-hm.

21
You know, I wish I could get him
to open up a bit. Share some feelings.

22
That's easy. You just have to think of him
as a jar of pickles that won't open.

23
So, what are you saying?

24
I should run him under hot water
and bang his head against a table?

25
No, that's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.

26
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
- How are you?
- Watch this.

28
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi, Phoebe.

29
So how are things going with you?

30
Can't complain.

31
- Hey!
- Hi.

32
- Great to...
- Ross, good to see you too.

33
- Good. Bye.
- You take care.

34
Hey, Pheebs, what was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?

35
Ah, that was so weird, huh?

36
Phoebe, why did you do it?

37
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.

38
He's... He's mad at you.

39
- What? Why?
- Oh, please. I think you know why.

40
I can't think of anything.

41
Come on, Ross. You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.

42
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I
didn't invite him to that Knicks game...

43
...a couple weeks ago?

44
Do you think that's something
that he'd be mad at you for?

45
- I guess it could.
- Well, then I think that's it.

46
Well, if he's angry,
he really shouldn't just cover it up.

47
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.

48
Well, if that's what you want...

49
...then you should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.

50
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden. Is that okay?

51
Yeah, that's great.

52
But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me.
Tell me about your day.

53
It was fine.

54
Okay.

55
Hey, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking right now?

56
That you are looking really fine
in that dress.

57
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know...

58
I want to know what...
Wow, those are really great.

59
I just want to know...

60
...what is behind this strong,
silent exterior?

61
You know, they say
that still waters run deep...

62
...and I want to swim in yours.

63
Are you talking about having sex?

64
No, Paul.

65
I don't know anything about you.

66
You know, like your childhood.
Tell me about your childhood.

67
Normal.

68
Okay, well, then how about puberty?
Come on. That's always a painful time.

69
You know, your friends invite you
to a slumber party...

70
...and stick your hand in warm water...

71
...while you're sleeping
so that you pee in your sleeping bag.

72
No, that never happened to me.

73
Well, you're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.

74
Anyway...

75
The rest of your life, you know.
Any regrets?

76
No.

77
All right, Paul.
I'm not asking for a lot here.

78
Just give me something. Anything.

79
- Okay.
- Okay.

80
- When I was 6 years old...
- Mm-hm.

81
...I wanted a Big Wheel.

82
And instead, my parents
got me this little...

83
...plastic chicken
that you hop around on.

84
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.

85
That was a pretty tough year.

86
- That's great. See?
- Heh.

87
I already feel like I know you a little better.
Thank you.

88
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat. Let's go.

89
It was horrible.

90
They called me "Chicken Boy."

91
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, it wasn't really a fight.

92
Richard Danville bit me on the nose.

93
I fell down, still have a little scar
right here. You can see it.

94
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.

95
Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that,
you know, you've shared your feelings.

96
It's really... It's beautiful.

97
But, um, what do you say
we go share some food?

98
No, I couldn't eat now.

99
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken.

100
Chicken?

101
- Chicken Boy!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

102
Well, this is the nine millionth ring store
we've been to...

103
...and I can't find the perfect ring.

104
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...

105
It's a beautiful selection.

106
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.

107
Maybe you do something different,
you know?

108
Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet.
Or an engagement tiara.

109
Ooh! An engagement
Revolutionary War musket.

110
You know, I'm so glad I picked you
to help me with this.

111
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.

112
Can't you imagine getting down
on one knee...

113
...and handing her this gorgeous
piece of weaponry?

114
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring.

115
Oh, this one's nice. I like it this one.

116
Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one?

117
Wait a minute.
This is the reason you brought me, okay?

118
I know how to haggle.
So let me handle this from here on out.

119
Can I help you?

120
- Yes, I would like to see that ring, please.
- Or not. Whatever.

121
This ring is from the 1920s.

122
It's a one-and-a-half karat diamond
with sapphires on either side.

123
Sir, could I ask you to, um?

124
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?

125
- Okay.
- Okay.

126
Will you marry me?

127
Oh, my God, that's it. That's the ring.

128
- How much is it?
- Chandler, I will handle this.

129
How much is it?

130
Eight thousand six hundred.

131
We will give you $10.

132
- Are you interested in this ring?
- Yes. Yes.

133
But I can only pay $8000.

134
- Okay. I can let it go for 8.
- We stand firm at $10.

135
- How would you like to pay?
- Uh, credit card.

136
Oh, no. No, no,
but I lent my credit card to Joey.

137
- Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
- Okay.

138
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

139
Do you have anything here for $10?

140
Uh, yes. I have these two
rather beautiful...

141
...five-dollar bills.

142
I'll give you $1 for them.

143
Hey, remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?

144
No.

145
- Remember, you were eating pizza?
- Yeah.

146
Well, apparently
Chandler's angry at us...

147
...for not getting him a ticket
to that Knicks game a couple weeks ago.

148
What, we were supposed
to just get him a ticket?

149
- That guy is always mooching off of us.
- Yeah.

150
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up, you know?

151
Like, maybe we could get him tickets
to another Knicks game and invite him.

152
Wow, that's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.

153
Here you go.

154
Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go.

155
You know, I gotta tell you,
sometimes I just don't get Chandler.

156
You know, me and him
do stuff all the time without you...

157
...and you don't get all upset.

158
- All the time?
- All the time.

159
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

160
- Still crying?
- Like a little girl.

161
I know, I know, I know.
This is all my fault.

162
I wanted him to open up.

163
But God, I didn't know
that I was gonna unleash...

164
...this weepy, clingy, moist monster.

165
You know, I only know
of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.

166
And one of them is sex.

167
- What's the other?
- I Don't know.

168
I never had to use the other one.

169
I'm just saying, you know,
if we're having sex, he's not talking.

170
Ah, that's right. You're the talker.

171
- Anyway, uh, great idea.
- Yeah.

172
Um, I gotta go to the store. I told him
that I would buy him some more tissues.

173
- Uh, we have some here.
- No, you don't.

174
Okay. Um, I'd also like to try on the tiara.

175
Oh, yeah. Okay.

176
Wow, what do you think? Too much?

177
A tad.

178
Then take the tiara back...

179
...and let me hold the musket again.

180
Something's missing.

181
Let me see the ring
that my friend picked out.

182
Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?

183
I just sold it to that gentleman.

184
Oh, my God!

185
Wait, no!

186
Let me out! Now!

187
Rachel?

188
No.

189
- How are you, Paul?
- Okay.

190
Chandler...

191
...did your dad ever hug you?
- No. Did he hug you?

192
No. No.

193
It's just that my dad never did.

194
I miss my dad.

195
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas
kissing other dads.

196
- Hey, Chandler?
- Yeah?

197
Would you?

198
Would you hug me?

199
- I'm a little busy here, Paul.
- That's exactly what my dad used to say.

200
Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out.

201
Hey. Hey.

202
There you go.

203
Okay.

204
- Five more seconds...
- Okay.

205
- Joey!
- What? Hey, what...?

206
Hi. Paul, is it?

207
- Do you have my credit card?
- Yeah. It's in my...

208
In my pocket.

209
- My back pocket. Back pocket.
- Thank God.

210
- Listen, I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
- I can't go.

211
Come on, it'll be fun.

212
Me, you, Ross and... Paul, probably.

213
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.

214
Oh, that's pretty nice,
but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.

215
Oh, wake up, Chandler.
The one you picked is gone. It's over.

216
What?

217
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry.
I tried to stop him but they put me in jail.

218
- They put you in jail?
- The little jail between the doors!

219
- Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring.
- I know. I'm sorry.

220
But, you know, this ring is better.
And Monica never even saw the other ring.

221
Yeah. But when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goose bumps.

222
- Maybe it was the guy.
- It was the ring.

223
- Hey, so was he excited about the tickets?
- No. He blew us off.

224
- What?
- I know.

225
I can't believe it.

226
Can I tell you something?

227
I'm a little mad at him now.

228
Can I tell you something?

229
Me too.

230
You know what? He didn't want
to talk to us about being angry?

231
Well, maybe we don't talk to him
at all.

232
Ooh.

233
- Freeze him out.
- That's right.

234
- I like it.
- Ah? We'll show him.

235
From now on, it's gonna be
Joey and Ross, best friends.

236
Okay, we're gonna be
the new Joey and Chandler. Ha, ha.

237
Hi, I'm back.

238
There's more to tell you.
I've written it all down.

239
Oh, that's great.

240
No, actually, that's...

241
That's great. That's really great.

242
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me, uh...

243
It gets me kind of hot.

244
Wait, wait. Listen to this:

245
Know what I wanted to be
when I was that age?

246
A lover?

247
- A surfer.
- Oh, yeah. A surfer?

248
- I wanted to be one with the waves...
- Honey, hold on real quick.

249
Hold on a second. Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.

250
Wait a second.

251
- This isn't too revealing, is it?
- No.

252
Whatever happened to that little dude?

253
So full of dreams.

254
I don't care about the little dude.

255
I can't. I cannot listen
to any more of this.

256
The only one who'd listen to this
is a mental health professional.

257
And that's only because
they get paid $100 an hour.

258
Do you know how much money
I could've made listening to you?

259
Two thousand dollars.

260
And you know when I figured that out?
While you were talking.

261
I can't believe you're trying
to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago...

262
...we figured out that that's exactly
what my mother was trying to do to me.

263
I'm sorry.

264
I don't mean...
I didn't mean to stifle you.

265
This is all just a little overwhelming.

266
Oh, Rachel.

267
I'm so sorry.

268
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.

269
It's just that when those gates open...

270
...it's hard to close them.

271
But they are closed now. Believe me.

272
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

273
And I'm glad that you're done.

274
So, what do you say we, um...

275
- I'd really like that.
- Mm-hm.

276
That was so good.

277
Oh, oh, ugh.

278
- Hey.
- I can't believe you talked me into...

279
...buying this stupid
gumball-machine-looking ring.

280
It's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking
ring. It's a beautiful ring.

281
No, it's not.

282
When I looked at the other ring...

283
...I could see Monica's face
when I gave it to her...

284
...and I could see her saying yes.

285
When I look at this ring,
all I see is a ring.

286
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.

287
Look, this is the most important thing
I'm gonna do in my life.

288
I want to make sure it's perfect.

289
Okay. There may be a way
that we could get the other ring back.

290
Because I heard the guy tell the jeweler
where he was gonna propose.

291
So maybe we could get him
to trade rings or something.

292
I can't do that.

293
Well, you certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.

294
There he is.

295
Okay, and he hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on her finger.

296
Wow, you're good.
After this, we should solve crimes.

297
Yeah. Okay. Go get him.

298
Oh, okay.

299
Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me,
please? You have a phone call.

300
- Who is it?
- It is your office.

301
- Do you know who at my office?
- John.

302
Oh, John. Great.

303
- There he is.
- Hi. Hi. Okay.

304
Okay, there was a mix-up
at the jewelry store.

305
The ring you're about to propose with
was supposed to be held for me.

306
So I'm gonna need to have that back.

307
But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.

308
Wow, I would trade.

309
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.

310
No, no. See, this is my fiancée,
and her heart was set on that ring.

311
You don't want to break her heart now,
do you?

312
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?

313
You're dying?

314
Yeah, she's dying...

315
...of a cough, apparently.

316
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
See, if I'm not buried with that ring...

317
...then my spirit will wander
the netherworld...

318
Okay, that's enough, honey.

319
Oh, I don't know.

320
- Let me see the ring.
- Great. Okay, here.

321
- All right, I'll do it.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

322
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.

323
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman.

324
Guys?

325
I got something important to tell you.

326
Guys.

327
Guys?

328
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

329
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.

330
Wait a minute. Is this for real?

331
Yeah. Check out the ring.

332
Oh, my God.

333
So you two are really serious?

334
Yeah, pretty much.

335
You're gonna get married? I mean...

336
We're gonna be brothers-in-law.
Come here!

337
- And we're gonna be friends again.
- Hey.

338
What?

339
- Water under the bridge. Forget it!
- Okay.

340
I was gonna wait till it was official,
you know, but I had to tell you guys...

341
...because you're my best friends.

342
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh. No more crying.

343
Please, I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.

344
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

345
Oh, my God.

346
Oh, Chandler.
You guys are gonna be so happy.

347
- I know.
- Where's all the tissues?

348
Check out the ring.

349
Oh, nice. One-and-a-half karat, easy.

350
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

351
Chandler's gonna ask Monica
to marry him.

352
I know. I helped pick out the ring.

353
Oh.

354
You told her before you told us?

355
She walked in
while I was looking at ring brochures.

356
You can understand that, right?

357
Guys?

﻿1
That is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

2
You should know,
you bought like a billion of them.

3
You didn't get one.

4
- Tonight's the big night.
- How will you ask her?

5
It'll be perfect.
We'll go to her favorite restaurant.

6
I'll get her a bottle of the champagne she really
loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.

7
Then, when the glasses are full, instead
of proposing a toast, I'll propose.

8
- Aw.
- Sounds perfect!

9
You'll mess up. Let me do it.

10
I won't mess up.

11
If she says no,
can I have the ring?

12
- She won't say no.
- If?

13
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
Hey, Monica.

15
- Give it.
- It's gone.

16
Phoebe.

17
- Hey.
- Hey, Monica!

18
We're practically kissing.

19
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

21
And the more people I bring,
the better I look.

22
So Monica, Chandler?

23
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

24
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- What's the big deal?

25
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

26
Where are you going?

27
- How about you guys?
- Open bar?

28
- I think so.
- I can do that for the kids.

29
I'll come. I'm making money now.
It's time I give some back.

30
You could give back
the money you owe me.

31
Okay. Have a benefit.

32
Ross, can you come
to a charity event tonight?

33
Oh. No, I have plans with Elizabeth.

34
Oh. You're already doing
your part for the kids.

35
It's our last night together before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

36
I have a question. All jokes aside.
Where is this relationship going?

37
Wait a minute. All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

38
- Do you see this as long-term thing?
- I don't know.

39
You are 12 years older than her.

40
Wait a minute.
Does everyone feel this way?

41
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sort of.

42
Uh, wow. Uh, I thought
you were making jokes. I had no idea.

43
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

44
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

45
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

46
Not what she said last night.

47
See, now he could date her.

48
Will you marry me?

49
Hey, you marry me.

50
What's going on, little elves?

51
It's the big night.
We wanted to wish you luck.

52
- Yeah. Have the ring?
- In my pocket.

53
Oh.

54
- Pheebs.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

55
Will you guys get out of here? I want this
to be a surprise, and she's gonna know.

56
Yeah, guys. Get out of here.

57
Hey. Hi, guys.

58
- You look beautiful.
- Aww. Thank you.

59
What's going on?

60
We're just really...

61
...excited about this charity event
that we have to go to.

62
- Here.
- Thank you.

63
So what's going on here?

64
Well, uh, this is a silent auction.

65
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

66
The highest bid gets it.

67
No. I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

68
- Uh, why?
- No, it's nice.

69
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

70
Someone? I brought people.

71
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.

72
- He's the head of my department.
- Oh, hi.

73
- And I also brought my friend Joey.
- Ohh! Shrimp toast!

74
You know, I don't know where he is.

75
I hope you're gonna bid.

76
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

77
- Nice choice.
- Yeah.

78
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

79
Ha.

80
Okay, $20.00.

81
Shut the door! Shut the door!

82
What's going on?

83
Guys across the hall
are throwing water balloons.

84
Call the police. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

85
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

86
Oh. Hmm.

87
Um, I just stopped by to see
if you wanted to see this play tonight.

88
Um, it's excellent. The director is...

89
- Who drank all the kamikazes?
- Nobody. We put them in here!

90
- You want some?
- No, I... Okay, okay.

91
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

92
Um, so this play, um,
what do you think?

93
- It's gotten great reviews.
- Attack!

94
- Put your balloons down!
- You put your balloons down!

95
Everybody put their balloons down!

96
Now, this is a nice suit!

97
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

98
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

99
Oh! So close!

100
Hey, you guys, look.
Got me some drinks.

101
- What are you doing?
- Open bar.

102
Finally, our biggest item
of the night.

103
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

104
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

105
I won!

106
That was my guess!

107
What? What? What?

108
I guessed $20,000.

109
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

110
What?

111
I don't have $20,000.

112
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

113
Joey, sit down.

114
Forget her. You enjoy this. Whoo!

115
What are you doing?

116
"One nation...

117
...under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

118
Ha, ha. I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

119
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.

120
I'm good. Are you good?

121
Are you perfect?

122
Yeah. I'm okay.

123
I'm a little cold.
Can I have your jacket?

124
Oh. Yeah.

125
Uh, no, you can't have my jacket.

126
Because then I would be cold.

127
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should have brought a jacket.

128
Uh, other than that, are you okay?

129
Are you sure you're okay?

130
Yes. I'm fine.

131
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...

132
...the reason is you.

133
That's sweet.

134
Okay. Um.

135
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

136
And I couldn't imagine growing old...

137
Oh, my God.

138
- I know. But let me say it.
- Oh, my God. Richard.

139
What? I'm Chandler.

140
Oh, that's Richard.

141
Maybe he won't see us.
Richard!

142
- Monica. Chandler.
- Hey.

143
I don't know why I did that.

144
- It's good to see you.
- You too. You let your hair grow.

145
Yeah. Oh, that's right,
you always wanted me to.

146
I see your mustache is back.

147
Well, my nose got lonely.

148
And you don't have a mustache,
which is good. Ha, ha.

149
I'm Chandler.
I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.

150
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

151
Richard!
No one's supposed to know about us!

152
See, I did it again.

153
- Chandler, sit down.
- I'll sit down.

154
Good to see you.

155
Your table is ready, sir.

156
- Oh. Good to see you guys.
- Yes.

157
If you prefer, this table's available.

158
That might be fun.

159
What were you thinking?

160
I didn't know it was an auction.

161
I figured I'd take a guess.

162
Help a charity. Free boat!

163
Why would a charity
give away a free boat?

164
- I don't know. Charity?
- Oh!

165
Well, just buy the damn boat.

166
Phoebe, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

167
I'm just helping the kids.

168
How is you drinking helping the kids?

169
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

170
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your contribution brings us...

171
...a big step closer
to building the youth center.

172
Just out of curiosity,
how much is that boat worth?

173
I think it was valued at 19,000.

174
Hey, I was pretty close.

175
Uh, so, bad news.

176
Um, I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

177
Joey! Joey, good one!

178
Good! Very good!

179
- So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off now.
- You can't leave, Joey!

180
You agreed to buy that boat.
It is a contract.

181
Plus, if you leave,
my boss is gonna kill me.

182
Well, what am I gonna do, Rach?
I don't have that kind of money.

183
I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

184
This is what we'll do.

185
We'll go to the next highest bidder,
and we'll let them buy it.

186
Then you're just gonna
pay the difference.

187
Okay.

188
I don't know why the kids need a
youth center anyway.

189
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. And I turned out fine.

190
Not great.

191
So we're hiding in the bathroom...

192
Then I sneak out. But before
Monica can, her parents come in.

193
I hid in the shower,
next thing you know...

194
...they're going at it on the floor.

195
Oh, my God!

196
I got a good one.

197
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

198
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

199
Uh, as a poet once said,
"In the sweetness of friendship...

200
...let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures...

201
...for in the dew of little things...

202
...the heart finds its morning and is
refreshed."

203
Aw.

204
What?

205
Oh, my God! You guys!

206
Before you say anything, have we got a story
for you. Guess who we bumped into?

207
- Who?
- Richard!

208
Oh. Oh.

209
I thought you were going out
with Elizabeth.

210
I was. Uh, she was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

211
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

212
Maybe she is too young for me.

213
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

214
I finally see what you were talking
about. I don't know what to do.

215
Just weigh the good stuff about
the relationship against the bad.

216
That's what I did when I first started
weighing stuff.

217
Okay, um, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.

218
If school finds out, you're fired.

219
- She's leaving for three months.
- For camp.

220
Okay, good stuff. Um...

221
Well, she's sweet and pretty and...

222
The only question you need to ask
is, do you see a future?

223
Do you see yourself marrying her?

224
My God. You did it already.
You married her, didn't you?

225
No, I didn't do that.
It's just...

226
Honestly, no,
I don't see a big future with her.

227
Okay, I think that's your answer.

228
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.

229
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...

230
...you may not get married
at all this year.

231
Rach, Rach.

232
- Next highest bidder is at table one.
- Great.

233
The guy who got the Paris trip
is at table four.

234
You care about the guy
who won the Paris trip?

235
It's a trip for two.

236
Excuse me.

237
Excuse me. Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?

238
- That was me.
- Oh. Enchanté.

239
Uh, is there
a Mr. Bowmont at this table?

240
- That's me.
- Ah.

241
Hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

242
The, uh, Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again.

243
I believe you made a bid of $18,000?

244
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

245
I was actually relieved,
uh, I didn't win the boat.

246
My wife would've killed me.

247
Are you kidding?
She'll love this boat!

248
- What is your wife's name?
- It's Pam.

249
It's Pam. Just imagine this.
The Pam.

250
Aw.

251
I don't think she'd like that.

252
Okay. Uh, imagine this:
The Mr. Bowmont.

253
Ooh.

254
I don't think so.

255
Okay, look. Let me paint you
a little picture. All right.

256
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your ha... Arms.

257
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

258
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

259
You get one of those hats,
people call you captain.

260
And then when you're old, Cappy.

261
What the hell. It's for a good cause.
All right!

262
- No way! It's mine!
- What?

263
The stuff you said, I want that!

264
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!

265
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!

266
Oh, my God! You're back!

267
Let me see your hand!

268
Why do you want to see my hand?

269
I want to see what's in your hand,
the trash.

270
Ew, it's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

271
Okay.

272
- What did you just do?
- What happened?

273
- Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
- Oh, no.

274
I was gonna do it tomorrow and surprise her.
Now you've ruined it.

275
We didn't.

276
Who walks into a room
and asks to see a person's hands?

277
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor.

278
- Glove salesman.
- Good one!

279
This is terrible.
What am I gonna do?

280
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

281
I'll make her think, uh, marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

282
Yeah. Convince her you're scared
of commitment.

283
I can do that.
I've had 30 years of practice.

284
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

285
Had to go to the basement...

286
...some idiot keeps stuffing
the chute with pizza boxes.

287
That guy's still doing that?

288
Hey. My God, let me see your hand!

289
No, you're too late!
She already took out the trash!

290
Wow. I have never had
such a healthy breakup.

291
She was such a grownup about it.

292
She didn't seem too immature for me.

293
Did I just make a huge mistake?

294
Ross? Wait!

295
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about...

296
You suck!

297
What?

298
Okay.

299
Breakup's still on.

300
Here she comes.

301
Do I look like a guy
who doesn't want to get married?

302
Yeah.

303
And, also, a little like a
French guy.

304
I never noticed that before.

305
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

306
What are you up to?

307
Just hanging out.
Talking about, uh, web sites.

308
Ha.

309
Ahem. We saw this interesting website
about marriage.

310
How unnecessary it is.

311
How it's a way for governments
to keep tabs on you.

312
Yeah, Big Brother. Ha, ha.

313
That's a little crazy.

314
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the Internet.

315
Got me thinking, why would anybody
want to get married?

316
Why? To celebrate the relationship.
To solidify the commitment.

317
To declare your love for one another
to the world.

318
Eh.

319
Okay. Well, that's good to know.

320
The Mr. Bowmont's here!

321
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

322
Sure! I love this part!

323
- Come on in.
- Hi.

324
Richard.

325
I'm not here to compliment the chef.

326
Oh. I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

327
Like I've nothing better to do.

328
What's up?

329
It was great seeing you
the other night.

330
Good to see you too.

331
Come down here
to tell me that?

332
No. Came here to tell you
something else.

333
Came here to tell you
I still love you.

﻿1
What? What did you... What?

2
I still love you.

3
I know I shouldn't even
be here telling you this.

4
You're with Chandler, a guy I really like.

5
You say he's straight, I'll believe you.

6
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

7
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

8
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

9
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...

10
...but I had to tell you.

11
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

12
I want to have kids with you.

13
Oh, my God.

14
Why don't they put chairs back here?

15
I know this is crazy, but am I too late?

16
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

17
I know. I was an idiot.

18
And I tried to forget you. I really did.

19
After we had lunch last year,
I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.

20
- What were you doing in Africa?
- Working with blind kids.

21
What are you doing to me?

22
Look, I...

23
I'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.

24
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

25
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

26
Well, he is. I mean...

27
...marriage is all he talks about.

28
My goodness.

29
In fact, I'm the one making him wait.

30
- You are?
- Yeah.

31
- Why?
- Why?

32
Because of the government.

33
Isn't it incredible?

34
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

35
I know. They'll be so happy together.

36
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

37
- Not that often.
- No.

38
I'm so happy for them.

39
Me too. So happy for them.

40
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

41
- Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
- Mm-mm.

42
I'm probably 98 percent happy
and maybe 2 percent jealous.

43
What's 2 percent? That's nothing.

44
Totally.

45
- I'm like 90-10.
- Yeah. Me too.

46
Hey, have you guys seen Chandler?

47
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

48
Tennille.

49
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

50
- You don't really believe that.
- Sure, I do.

51
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

52
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

53
Pigs don't mate for life.

54
A pig can have 100 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

55
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

56
Wait a minute.

57
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

58
Never say never, but, probably...

59
...yeah, never.

60
Oh, my God.

61
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

62
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is all this pressure?

63
Is this some new strategy?

64
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

65
You know what? I gotta go.

66
It's okay. I got a plan.

67
- We're gonna find love.
- Definitely.

68
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

69
That's what makes it so easy to be
80 percent happy for Monica and Chandler.

70
- Would be nice to have a guarantee.
- What do you mean?

71
Some people make deals with a friend.

72
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

73
- You mean a backup?
- Exactly.

74
Yeah, yeah. I've got that.

75
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

76
- Who?
- Joey?

77
- Joey? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

78
Yeah, I locked him in years ago.

79
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

80
Yep. We shook on it.

81
Yeah. But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

82
Seriously?

83
I think his exact words were...

84
Charming.

85
- Ah, he's just a backup.
- Yeah.

86
Hey, Monica.

87
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

88
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

89
Yeah, it's great.

90
What's the matter? Talk to the captain.

91
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

92
Chandler's giving you a hard time?

93
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe...

94
...we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

95
- You know Chandler.
- No, I don't know Chandler.

96
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

97
Maybe you changed.

98
I didn't change.

99
Maybe that's the problem.

100
- What?
- Chandler is a complex fellow.

101
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

102
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

103
Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

104
And always will be.

105
Well, there's some people
who do want to marry me.

106
- There are?
- Yeah. Richard.

107
Richard said he wants to marry you?

108
- And Chandler says he hates marriage?
- That's right.

109
Chandler loves marriage!

110
You just told me he hates marriage!

111
That he's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife!

112
That he's against marriage
and always will be!

113
You got that from what I said?

114
- Rach.
- Hey, you.

115
- Hey, come on in.
- Thank you.

116
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

117
Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

118
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

119
Yeah. Love.

120
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

121
I guess so.

122
So, what do you say we make a pact?

123
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

124
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...

125
...we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises there.

126
No, like, "What's that?"

127
- Oh, you want me to be your backup.
- Exactly.

128
Oh, yeah. I already have one.

129
- Who?
- Phoebe.

130
Phoebe?

131
But she just said Joey is her backup.

132
Oh, I don't think so.

133
I just spoke with her.
She said that she and Joey made a deal.

134
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.

135
We shook on it.

136
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

137
Where have you been?

138
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

139
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

140
- What?
- I've been looking for you.

141
Stop messing with her!

142
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

143
- Oh, my God!
- I know! They suck!

144
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

145
- I know!
- What...?

146
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

147
Will you help me?

148
Look, us getting our asses kicked
is not a solution.

149
Okay?

150
- Look, just go and find Monica.
- You're right.

151
I'm gonna get the ring...

152
...I'll go find her...

153
...and I'll propose!

154
Dude! Dude! Dude!

155
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

156
Hi.

157
I don't know why I'm here.

158
I didn't ask.

159
You want to come in?

160
I don't know.

161
Oh, okay.

162
I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

163
Chandler is such an idiot!

164
Drink?

165
- Scotch on the...
- Rocks with a twist?

166
I remember.

167
- You still smoking cigars?
- Uh...

168
No, no. That's art.

169
If it bothers you, I can put my art out.

170
No, that's okay.

171
So, Monica...

172
...let me ask you a question.

173
Since we broke up, do you ever...

174
...think about me?

175
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

176
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's because I...

177
...had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

178
- Who is it?
- Edward Nevsky.

179
Yeah, he's no good.

180
Do you ever think about me in...

181
...a non-eye-doctor way?

182
No.

183
Ah.

184
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

185
I never let myself think about you.

186
Wow.

187
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

188
You can't have two backups!

189
Of course I can.

190
It's just good sense
to back up your backup.

191
- Look, I've already lost Chandler.
- What?

192
Hey, Phoebe!

193
We're both backups?

194
How could you do this to me?

195
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.

196
- I was not!
- No, we weren't!

197
This kind of back talk
isn't gonna fly when we're married.

198
You can't have both. Pick one.

199
- Pick me!
- No, pick me!

200
I don't want to end up an old maid.

201
Well, let's see.

202
Ross is a good father.

203
But...

204
...Joey has a boat. This is hard.

205
This is crazy. I want to switch to Rachel.

206
I want to switch too.

207
No, wait! Okay, just wait!

208
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

209
Remember my promise:

210
If we get married, three times a week.

211
Oh, my God. Phoebe...

212
I'm talking about massages.

213
No, I'm not.

214
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.

215
I'll write "Joey"...

216
...on one napkin.

217
And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin...

218
...and we'll pick one.

219
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.

220
- That sounds fair.
- All right.

221
Good. Switching them up.

222
Ooh...

223
- Pick one.
- Left.

224
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

225
- Ross.
- Joey.

226
- We should just switch.
- Absolutely.

227
I miss this apartment.

228
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

229
- I should be with a grownup, you know?
- Yeah.

230
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

231
Maybe someone with...

232
...a license to practice medicine.

233
Or a mustache.

234
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

235
I need to be with someone
who wants the same things.

236
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

237
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

238
I think that's fair.

239
Fair? Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.

240
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

241
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

242
Believe me, nothing about this
is fair. Nothing.

243
- Nothing! Nothing!
- It's okay.

244
Hey. Shh.

245
Nothing.

246
I don't know.

247
I know.

248
Yeah, I... I...

249
I have to figure...

250
...some stuff, before I can...

251
Yeah, I understand.

252
Take as much time as you want.

253
Ten, 20 minutes, if you need it.

254
I'll be here. Not smoking.

255
- Chandler.
- Where is she?

256
I'm not scared of you.

257
She's not here. And please come in.

258
Scotch on the rocks...

259
...with a twist, on a coaster.

260
Monica? Monica?

261
Okay, she was here. But she left.

262
Where did she go?

263
She said she had to think things over.

264
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

265
Oh, hey. Look, nothing happened.

266
Nothing happened? Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?

267
Well, all right, one thing happened.

268
You know what you did?

269
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

270
You made my girlfriend think!

271
Well, I'm sorry.

272
What's to think about? I love her.

273
Well, apparently I'm willing
to offer her things that you are not.

274
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.

275
To throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

276
If it helps, it worked very well.

277
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

278
This isn't fair.

279
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

280
This is my chance and I won't blow it...

281
...because we are meant for each other.

282
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

283
I was gonna propose tonight.

284
You were?

285
Yeah, I even...

286
...got a ring.

287
Did you get a ring?

288
No, I don't have a ring.

289
You go get her.

290
And can I give you a piece of advice?

291
If you do get her...

292
...don't let her go.

293
Trust me.

294
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.

295
I know.

296
I hate that.

297
- Dude.
- I've gotta find Monica.

298
She's gone.

299
- What?
- She had a bag and she left.

300
- What?
- She was crying.

301
She said you want different things
and she needs to think.

302
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?

303
I did! I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.

304
Well, where...?

305
Where did she go?

306
To her parents'.
She said you shouldn't call.

307
But if I were you, I would.

308
Can't believe I ruined this.

309
I am so sorry, man.

310
You wanted it to be a surprise.

311
Oh, my God.

312
Chandler...

313
...in all my life...

314
...I never thought I would be so lucky...

315
...as to fall in love with my best...

316
My best...

317
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay.

318
I'll do it. I thought...

319
Wait, I can do this.

320
I thought that it mattered...

321
...what I said or where I said it.

322
Then I realized...

323
...the only thing that matters is that you...

324
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

325
And if you let me...

326
...I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

327
Monica...

328
...will you marry me?

329
Yes.

330
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

331
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

332
Come in! Come in!

333
We're engaged!

334
Oh!

335
This is the least jealous I've ever been!

336
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

337
- Oh.
- Oh.

338
He's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!

339
Yeah.

340
Oh, my darling

341
You were wonderful tonight

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

2
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
Are you trying to kill me?

4
- Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
- Uh-huh, what?

5
Um, well, since I'm moving out
and you're so beautiful...

6
...how about I move in with you?

7
Well, that would be great,
but then what do we do about Denise?

8
- Who's Denise?
- My roommate.

9
- You have a roommate?
- Yes, Denise. Denise.

10
Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
Huh?

11
And what about this Denise? She cute?

12
How can you have a roommate
that none of us know about?

13
Maybe because you never listen
to anything I say.

14
I talk about her all the time. Denise!

15
Rach, I was thinking, I'm gonna have
an extra room over at my place.

16
- Oh, that's true.
- Why don't you move in with me?

17
It'll be great.
We can stay up late talking, watch movies.

18
And you know
about naked Thursdays, right?

19
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'm gonna find my own place.

20
Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

21
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

23
Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.

24
- Oh. You didn't tell her, did you?
- No.

25
- Because you're in love with her.
- I am not in love with her.

26
She was very upset
about having to move out.

27
So I didn't tell her we were still married,
because she'd only get more upset.

28
I comforted her. As a friend.

29
- What do you mean, "comforted her"?
- It was nothing. I gave her a hug.

30
Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.

31
It's also a sign of friendship.

32
Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.

33
It was a hug.

34
Just tell me this,
did you or did you not smell her hair?

35
Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?

36
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones
come out the top of her head.

37
That's why women are shorter.

38
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

39
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.

40
I was hugging her as a friend, okay?

41
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.

42
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all, uh...

43
...you know, coconutty.

44
What? Oh. It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

45
Maybe it means I have feelings
for coconuts.

46
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful.
Rachel's not in the same place you are.

47
Okay, if the place you're referring to
is being in love...

48
...then she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

49
Okay, I didn't understand that.

50
But maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

51
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
- Dude, some guy just called for you.
- Who was it?

53
I don't know.

54
How about
"Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.

55
Hey, listen.

56
When you move in,
Rachel's room's gonna be empty.

57
You wanna talk
about what we wanna do with it?

58
- Sure.
- Okay.

59
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

60
...with a mahogany sleigh bed
and bedside tables with flowers on them.

61
Then we could have a rolltop desk
with comment cards...

62
...so people can tell us
how much they love staying here.

63
Whatever, you know,
I really haven't thought about it that much.

64
Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.

65
But I was thinking maybe
it could be a game room, you know?

66
I mean, you can buy old arcade games...

67
...like "Space Invaders"
and "Asteroids" for $200.

68
The real ones. The big, big, big ones.

69
No.

70
Okay, so you mean "no" as in,
"Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.

71
Let's discuss it
before we reject it completely."

72
Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.

73
Yes. Interesting idea,
um, talk about it, but no.

74
So that's it?

75
Well, I just don't think that arcade games
go in the beautiful guest room.

76
The guest room's gonna be filled
with antiques.

77
Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect.
It's the oldest game.

78
What do you have
against the guest room?

79
I don't have anything
against the guest room.

80
Especially since everybody that we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

81
Are you mocking me?

82
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

83
What's up?

84
Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.

85
But you're still moving in together, right?
Because my ad came out today.

86
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

87
- Nice.
- Ah?

88
I figured after living with you...

89
...it'd be an interesting change
to have a female roommate.

90
You know? Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

91
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

92
...than, say, a girl who is 19?

93
Ah? Ha, ha.

94
Not just a hat rack, my friend.

95
- Pheebs, I have to ask you...
- Shh. I'm swamped right now.

96
You're just staring into space.

97
Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.

98
- This one?
- It worked!

99
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

100
Every place that I can afford
comes with a roommate who is a freak.

101
Look at this.

102
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

103
- It's just there's nothing. This city is full.
- Wait, no, look at this.

104
"Two-bedroom, two-bath.
Must be nonsmoker.

105
Satan worshipers okay."

106
Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

107
- Hey.
- Hey.

108
- Rach, are you still looking for a place?
- Yeah, why?

109
Okay, there's this guy Warren
from the museum...

110
...and he's going on a dig
for like two years.

111
And he's got this great place
he needs to sublet.

112
So you interested?

113
That sounds great.
I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.

114
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

115
You wanna thank someone,
thank the volcano...

116
...that erupted thousands of years ago...

117
...killing but perfectly preserving
an entire civilization.

118
Here's Warren's number.

119
Oh, this is great.
I am gonna call him right now.

120
- Oh, okay. Oh.
- Thank you. Ha, ha.

121
Okay, you go call him.

122
I saw it.

123
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
I'm talking about that which you already
know but won't admit.

125
You know, that you love her again.
You relove her.

126
Look, I do not relove her.

127
I can't believe you won't just admit it.

128
Okay, just promise me
that you won't do anything stupid.

129
Look, we're just friends now, okay?
Why would I do anything stupid?

130
Ugh. Well, the apartment
is already subletted.

131
I mean, this is just hopeless.
I'm never gonna find anything.

132
You can live with me.

133
- What?
- What?

134
What?

135
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

136
I would love to live with you, Ross.
That's great. Thank you.

137
I'm just glad I could,
you know, help you out.

138
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so not stupid.

139
Ross, Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

140
I mean, I was gonna be homeless.
You've just saved me. You're my hero.

141
Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.

142
Oh. I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

143
- Aw. Mwah.
- Oh, please.

144
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?

145
No. No, I won't.

146
But I should tell you this.

147
This exact same thing happened
to my roommate, Denise.

148
She moved in with a guy...

149
...who was secretly married to her
and said he didn't love her but really did.

150
It just blew up.

151
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

152
Okay, that's a lie.

153
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need to have a game room.

155
When I was a kid, I only played
those games because I couldn't get girls.

156
Now I can get...

157
Now I have you.

158
No, not that I think that I have you...

159
...or think of you as property
in any sort of way.

160
- I see women...
- Stop it, Chandler.

161
I'm sorry too.

162
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yes.

163
Oh.

164
Listen, we don't have to make that
a guest room.

165
- We can think of something together.
- That's a great idea.

166
We can easily think of a way
for us both to enjoy the room.

167
Totally.

168
- We don't have to come up with this now.
- Oh, good.

169
Why don't we think about changes
that we can make in the living room?

170
Changes?

171
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move
some furniture to make room for my chair.

172
You're gonna bring the Barcalounger
over here?

173
- Is that a problem?
- Well...

174
It's just that they're a set
and they should probably stay together.

175
Oh, that's cool.
Then I'll just bring them both over.

176
See, now you're taking them away
from their home.

177
Okay, I get it. So I get nothing.
Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.

178
I'll get up in the morning,
put on your clothes, and head off to work.

179
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
That's it. That's it.

180
Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

181
Oh, come on.
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

182
It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?

183
In the game room.

184
Look, it is not my fault
that your chairs are incredibly ugly.

185
That's fine. I won't bring over the chairs.
I won't bring anything over.

186
I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandma's place!

187
Everything on your application
looks really good.

188
Oh, just one last question.

189
Are you and your friends
gonna be over here all the time partying?

190
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not really a party girl.

191
Whoa.

192
Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.

193
I want you to really think
about your answers.

194
You can call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

195
Oh, don't listen to him.

196
He's just some guy
who wants the apartment.

197
But I don't think he's gonna get it.

198
Why did you take
the shower curtain down?

199
That thing was a hazard.

200
I'm very safety-conscious.

201
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
Oh, I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

203
Oh, thanks.

204
But listen, I was just at Monica's...

205
...and she and Chandler had a big fight
and they're not moving in.

206
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

207
No, no, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

208
What? Over a stupid room?

209
I feel kind of bad for them...

210
...but I'm also psyched
because I don't have to move in here.

211
Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.

212
What's all this about you guys fighting?

213
Is this really over a room?

214
I mean, that is so silly.

215
- Ross, we can handle this.
- Well, apparently not.

216
And I can't just stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

217
...be hurt by something that is so silly.

218
- I mean, enough of the silliness.
- Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?

219
Okay, okay.

220
Two very good points.

221
Look, I've known you both a long time.

222
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

223
...as you've been since you got together.

224
Do you really wanna throw that all away
over a room?

225
That is so silly.

226
What's more important, love...

227
...or silliness?

228
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

229
But we also have a soft spot for the love.

230
- Love is the best medicine.
- That's laughter.

231
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

232
Now, Chandler,
you wanna live with Monica, right?

233
Yeah, I do.

234
And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler,
don't you?

235
Yes.

236
Good. A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York.

237
So I understand
you're looking for a place?

238
- No, no, I'm staying put.
- Oh.

239
I was going to offer you my apartment.

240
Why? Where are you going?

241
I don't know.

242
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

243
Uh, you're never gonna believe it.
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.

244
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

245
Oh, wow.

246
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

247
Yeah. You know, about that, um...

248
Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

249
...but don't you think
it's gonna be weird?

250
Why? Why? Why would it...?
Why would it be weird?

251
Well, you know, because of us.

252
Because of our history.

253
- No.
- No?

254
No, no.

255
It would only be weird
if we were still in that place.

256
I mean, are you still in that place?

257
- No, not at all.
- Good. Me neither.

258
So it's not a problem.

259
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

260
Okay, but, Ross,
eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.

261
Really? We are?

262
Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend
and you're gonna have a girlfriend.

263
Oh. Heh.

264
That'd be great.

265
But if you think it's gonna be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

266
It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign:

267
"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."

268
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

269
So are you sure
about this whole moving-in thing?

270
I mean, it's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

271
That's very funny.

272
He's being silly
because he knows we enjoy the silliness.

273
No, I'm serious, okay?
I mean, think about it.

274
You move in, you start fighting
over stupid game rooms...

275
...next thing you know, you break up.

276
Ross, you were right before.
It was just a stupid fight about a room.

277
Okay, there are no stupid fights.

278
This isn't about the room.

279
This is about what the room represents.

280
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you.

281
- Yeah, I'm not so worried.
- Yeah, no, me neither.

282
Fine. It's your life.

283
I just don't wanna see you break up.

284
Which you will do
if you move in together.

285
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

286
Don't do it!

287
- You still wanna move in together, right?
- Of course.

288
Ross didn't scare you?

289
Scared me out of ever wanting
to live with him.

290
- Come here, I gotta show you something.
- Okay.

291
Oh, my God,
someone's killed Square Man.

292
This is where the Barcalounger could go.

293
You see, you can see the TV, and still,
it's walking distance to the kitchen.

294
Oh, that's so sweet.

295
I wanna show you something.

296
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

297
Mm-hm.

298
You know? So I was thinking
we could get one of those signs...

299
...and hang it over our bed.

300
Because that's you and I together.

301
"Merge."

302
- Oh, my God, I love that.
- Really?

303
"No."

304
I found you in my bed

305
How'd you wind up there?

306
You are a mystery

307
Little black curly hair

308
Little black, little black
Little black, little black

309
Little black curly hair

310
Thank you.

311
Um...

312
If you wanna receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

313
...then please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

314
So, uh... Ahem.

315
Where are the other guys?

316
Well, let's see,
Monica and Chandler are occupied.

317
- Fighting?
- No, the other thing.

318
I really think it's great
they worked things out.

319
Yeah, there's no breaking them up,
is there?

320
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house
so I can make a copy?

321
- Here.
- Thank you.

322
Now, are you sure?

323
Because once I make a copy,
there's no turning back.

324
Yeah, I'm sure.

325
Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

326
Uh, listen, Ross.

327
You really think this moving in with Rachel
is a good idea?

328
I've been back and forth.

329
Yeah, well,
maybe you should go back, okay?

330
Rachel moves in,
and before you know it...

331
...you're where you don't wanna be,
back together.

332
Yeah, I don't think so.

333
She's already talking about,
you know, dating other guys.

334
That's not gonna work out.

335
Then she's gonna come home all weepy,
and you'll be telling her:

336
"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."

337
And then, bam, she finds you.

338
Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.

339
I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

340
Now, is that what you want?

341
- Heh. Is that what I want?
- Yes.

342
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.

343
All right, well, the place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

344
Or not.

345
Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in
with me?

346
- Ahh.
- Oh.

347
- Whoa, whoa, Joey.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

348
Look, Rach, I know I scared you off
with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

349
...but we don't have to do that.

350
Well, it would be easier
to move just right across the hall.

351
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking
about naked Wednesdays.

352
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day.

353
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
Come on in. Thanks for coming back.

355
Okay, there have been a lot of people
interested in the room.

356
But I have narrowed it down,
and you are one of the finalists.

357
- Great.
- Okay, now, before I make my decision...

358
...I just wanna make sure
that our personalities match, okay?

359
So I made up a little test.

360
Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then
you say the first thing that comes to mind.

361
- I can do that.
- Okay, here we go.

362
- Pillow.
- Fight.

363
Very good.

364
Okay. G.

365
- String?
- Excellent.

366
Okay. Um...

367
Doggy.

368
- Kitten?
- Ooh, sorry.

369
No, no, no. So close, though.
But, you know, okay, bye-bye.

﻿1
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

2
This bottle opener.

3
- And?
- And it's a magnet.

4
Look at that.

5
How weird is that?
You know, you're moving in with me...

6
...and you have the one thing
I don't have. Ha, ha.

7
It's like, in a way, you complete me.
Huh?

8
- Kitchen.
- What?

9
You complete me kitchen, matey.

10
- Ross, I know what you're thinking.
- What?

11
That she's gonna move in with you...

12
...and then maybe fall in love with you,
and then...

13
...when she finds out you're already
married, oh, she'll be happy.

14
You know? You're just... You're very sad.

15
Oh, my God.

16
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel.

17
- What?
- Of course. It all adds up.

18
I mean, you're obsessed with her.
It's always:

19
"Ross, what are you gonna do
about Rachel?

20
Ross, why are you moving in
with Rachel?

21
When are you gonna confess
your secret marriage to Rachel?"

22
- You want her.
- No!

23
Uh-oh. Saved by the bell.

24
Hello.

25
Hey, Rach.
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

26
No, no, I bought those.

27
- Oh, right. I forgot.
- Yeah.

28
That you're a liar.

29
No, no, that's great. I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

30
Okay.

31
Um, that was the head
of the paleontology department...

32
...at NYU.

33
Wow. What did he say?

34
Uh, remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

35
- Well, they loved it.
- Well, who wouldn't?

36
I know!

37
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

38
I mean, it's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

39
How great would that look
on the mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.

40
Yeah. Professor and Mrs.

41
And Mrs?

42
Oh, yeah, you know,
you and Ross are still married.

43
What?

44
Just kidding.

45
Oh, God.

46
Saved your ass.

47
- Hey.
- Hi.

48
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

49
Well, ahem.

50
- You know that psychic I see?
- Yeah?

51
She told me
that I'm gonna die this week...

52
...so I'm kind of bummed about that.

53
- What?
- I know you don't know about readings...

54
...but that one is pretty much
the worst one you can get.

55
Phoebe, that's crazy.

56
I can't believe she'd say that to you?

57
Yeah, honey,
you don't believe her, do you?

58
I don't know.
She, you know, said that I'd have triplets...

59
...but she also said one of them
would be black.

60
Oh.

61
Just out of curiosity,
did she tell you how you were gonna go?

62
No, because she didn't tell me
I was gonna die till the end of the session.

63
And I was not gonna waste
a whole other hour there.

64
I mean, I've only got a week left,
you know?

65
I've really gotta start living now.

66
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, hi.

67
- Hey.
- Hey. Well, today's my first lecture...

68
...and I kind of wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

69
No, that'd be great.

70
Okay.

71
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

72
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two..."

73
Oh, this is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

74
"...subcategories.
The first of these subcategories is..."

75
Um, Ross? Heh.

76
Are there, uh, naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

77
No. Why?

78
Well, I just never seen a guy
stare so hard at paper...

79
...that didn't have naked chicks on it.

80
Oh, okay. Okay.

81
"There are three primary theories...

82
...concerning sediment flow rate.

83
Each of these theories...

84
...can be further subcategorized into..."

85
Why don't you open with a joke?

86
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

87
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

88
You're not talking about
Chuckles University?

89
Okay.

90
Come on, we're kidding.

91
You know what might make it
less boring?

92
Thank you.

93
Some, um... Some visual aids.

94
Oh, oh!
You know what's a good visual aid?

95
Please don't say naked chicks.

96
Why not?

97
I don't even know why I bothered
to even talk to you guys about it.

98
You know, I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

99
That's the way I did it till I was 19.

100
- Hey.
- Hey.

101
Any good mail?

102
Yes, you got something
from the Screen Actors Guild.

103
Ooh, it's probably a residual check.
Hey, can you open it? I got...

104
- "Benefits lapsed."
- Hmm. That's weird.

105
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

106
Okay, it's not a check.

107
They're saying your health insurance
expired because...

108
...you didn't work enough last year.
- Let me see that.

109
All right.

110
Oh, I can't believe this.

111
This sucks.

112
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...

113
...or catch on fire, you know?

114
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

115
I'm sorry, man.
There's never a good time to have to...

116
...stop catching on fire.

117
All right, well...

118
...I guess I gotta go get a job.
I'm gonna see my agent.

119
Okay, make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

120
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."

121
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs, you're still alive.

122
How are you feeling?

123
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

124
Oh, by the way, do you think you...

125
Pheebs, what are you doing?

126
I was preparing you for...
Didn't you think I was dead?

127
Did that not come off?

128
Oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

129
- Pheebs, you wanna lie down?
- Yeah, thanks.

130
And listen, can you do me a favor?

131
Could you just wake me up
in a couple hours.

132
You know, if you can.

133
Monica?

134
Did you take these back?

135
No, no. I just liked them so much
that I went out and bought some for myself.

136
Oh, yeah, they're really great,
aren't they?

137
- I love them.
- Yeah.

138
Nice try.

139
- Hello.
- Hey, how'd the lecture go?

140
It went great.

141
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

142
Oh, that's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

143
I knew all I had to do
was let the material speak for itself.

144
Everyone's all, uh,
"Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."

145
Well, I proved them wrong.

146
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

147
- That you're not funny or sexy?
- That's right.

148
- Hey, Estelle, listen...
- Well, well, well.

149
Joey Tribbiani.

150
So you came back, huh?

151
They think they can do better,
but they all...

152
...come crawling back to Estelle.

153
What are you talking about?

154
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

155
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
Oh, well, no harm, no foul.

157
Look, Estelle, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

158
All right, first thing we gotta do:
Damage control.

159
- Why?
- Well, I think, uh...

160
...someone out there...

161
...may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

162
The bastard.

163
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

165
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

166
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

167
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

168
Nothing.

169
Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

170
And then I, uh, passed out...

171
...and, uh, I haven't been able
to stand up since. Ha, ha.

172
But I don't think it's anything serious.

173
This sounds like a hernia.
You have to... Go to the doctor.

174
No way.

175
If I'm gonna go to the doctor
for anything...

176
...it's gonna be for this thing
sticking out of my stomach.

177
That's a hernia.

178
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

179
Damn you, 15s.

180
We're a little early.
The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.

181
- Yeah, but we can sneak in and watch.
- Yeah. Good.

182
Oh, hey, look.
There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.

183
I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters.

184
Wow, we really are bitches.

185
Right. So when Rigby got his samples...

186
...back from the laboratory...

187
...he made a startling discovery.

188
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

189
Imagine his consternation when...

190
Oh, bloody hell.

191
What the hell are you doing?

192
Look, I was nervous.

193
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

194
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

195
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

196
Yeah, and not a very good one.

197
Will you, please?

198
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

199
I'm a professor in the paleontology
department here.

200
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

201
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.

202
Monica Geller.

203
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

204
What are you doing?

205
You can have an accent, but I can't?

206
Top of the morning to you, laddies.

207
Would you just please stop?

208
Yes.

209
Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

210
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

211
Sit down.

212
- Will you go to the hospital?
- Dude, hernia operations cost, like...

213
...a lot probably, okay?

214
Besides, it's getting darker
and more painful.

215
That means it's healing.

216
Look, I will loan you the money.

217
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing...

218
...pushed back in.

219
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you that money back.

220
And I don't want that
hanging over my head, okay?

221
Besides, as soon as my insurance
kicks in...

222
...I can get all the free operations I want.

223
I think I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

224
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
- Hey.
- What's going on?

226
Well, Joey's got a bad hernia...

227
...but it's nothing a little
laser eye surgery won't fix.

228
Look, I'm telling you, if I put my hand
on my stomach right here...

229
...it doesn't hurt that bad. Ah.

230
Hey, maybe you'll die.

231
Chandler, I'm scared.

232
No, we can go together.

233
Just don't wait too long, though...

234
...because I'm out of here
sometime before Friday.

235
But I don't want to die.

236
No, no. It'll be fun.

237
We can come back
and we can haunt these guys.

238
- Give me them.
- No, they are mine.

239
- You stole them from me.
- You stole them from me.

240
Give me them.

241
You just wanna each take one?

242
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

243
Look, I really need some help, okay?

244
Why? Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

245
What do I do?

246
Well, why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

247
People will think that you're
adjusting to life in America.

248
Yeah, I mean, come on.
No one will even notice.

249
I mean, they're probably
not even listening to you.

250
They're not listening to me?

251
Of course they're listening to you.

252
Everybody listens to you.

253
Monica, do you really think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

254
I think you look fine.

255
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

256
Hey, Timmy.

257
I've got a surprise...

258
...for you.

259
Hold it. I'm sorry.

260
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

261
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.
Just hold on one second.

262
Hey, Timmy.

263
I've got a surprise for you.

264
Oh, my God!

265
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.

266
Pick up a bag today.

267
- That's where you pick up the bag.
- Exactly.

268
No, the line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

269
Or I could just point to it. Huh?

270
Blah, blah, blah. Purina One.
Point to a bag today.

271
- I didn't get it, did I?
- No.

272
Yeah, okay.

273
Hi.

274
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

275
I'm here to audition for "Man."

276
You mean "Dying Man."

277
Yes.

278
- Okay, come on. Do it one more time.
- Really? Really? Okay.

279
Ross, this is Dr. McNeely...

280
...from Fake Accent University.

281
We'd like you to come on board
with us full-time.

282
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
Listen to this.

284
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

285
- Really? How do you know?
- Because my psychic is dead.

286
- She must have read the cards wrong.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

287
Ah, better her than me.

288
Hey, let's bake cookies!

289
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.

290
- Are you sure you can do this?
- Yeah.

291
And, hey, thanks for coming with me.

292
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

293
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

294
Hey, Joey. We're ready for you.

295
Joey, this is Alex.
He's gonna be playing your son.

296
Hi, Alex.

297
And, uh, as you can see,
my hands are not in my pants.

298
Okay.

299
All right, uh, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line:

300
"Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

301
All right, let's do this.

302
Scene five, take one.

303
And action.

304
Take good care of your mama, son.

305
Come on, son.

306
Your mama's good people.

307
Cut.

308
Alex, remember,
you're supposed to cry.

309
- Can you cry for us this time?
- Okay.

310
All right. From the top.

311
Scene five, take two.

312
Take 36 is up.

313
Let's try this again.

314
You ready, Joe?

315
Uh, one thing,
is it all right with you if I scream...

316
...right up until you say, "Action"?

317
- Sure.
- Okay.

318
- Action!
- Take good care of your mama, son.

319
- Cut.
- Aah!

320
I'm sorry. Hey, hey.
Joe, why don't you lift up your shirt?

321
Take a look at this, kiddo.

322
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

323
- Hello.
- Hello, is Ross there?

324
No, he's not. Can I take a message?

325
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross' divorce lawyer.

326
Just tell him that since
I haven't heard from him...

327
...I assume he's decided
to give the marriage a try.

328
Ross got married again? Aah! No.

329
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

330
Phasing it out.

331
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...

332
...the team would never
have identified...

333
...the initial errors
in their carbon dating analysis."

334
Were there any questions
at this point?

335
- Yes.
- What's happening to your accent?

336
Come again? What's this nonsense?

337
All right. I'm not English.

338
I'm from Long Island.

339
I was really nervous, and the accent...

340
...just, um... Just came out.

341
Ha, ha. I'm sorry.

342
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

343
Um, were there any questions?

344
About paleontology?

345
All right, look, I was just trying
to make a good first impression.

346
Obviously, I screwed up.

347
But what you guys think of me
is really important...

348
...because I'm hoping
to get a permanent job here.

349
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression...

350
Ross. Are you crazy?

351
I am still your wife?
What, were you just never gonna tell me?

352
What the hell is wrong with you?

353
Ugh, I could just kill you!

354
Well, hello, Rachel.

355
- You've really done this before?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

356
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

357
Now, don't hold back.

358
- Hey.
- Hey.

359
What are you doing?

360
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

361
Oh, all right.

﻿1
Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me
we are still married.

2
Look, I was going to tell you.

3
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

4
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married.

5
- You're kidding?
- Oh, my God.

6
Ross.

7
Okay, maybe it wasn't
my best decision...

8
...but I couldn't face
another failed marriage.

9
Let me just jump in and ask.

10
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

11
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

12
Okay, maybe it's best
not to think about it.

13
Oh, this is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

14
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

15
Another lie. You have a sickness.

16
Ross, just for my own peace of mind...

17
...you're not married
to any more of us, are you?

18
Oh, hey, someone left their keys.

19
Ooh, to a Porsche.

20
- Hey, Gunther, are these yours?
- Yeah. That's what I drive.

21
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

22
Uh-uh.

23
Hey, did anybody lose their keys?

24
Why don't you put them
in the lost and found?

25
There's a lost and found?

26
My shoe!

27
You left a shoe here?

28
Well, I didn't realize till I got home.

29
I wasn't gonna walk all the way
back down here with one shoe.

30
I'm gonna go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

31
Oh, good. When he comes back for
his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.

32
Great. Thanks.

33
Oh, good, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

34
How would you like
to spend tomorrow...

35
...taking care of three
incredibly cute little puppies?

36
Oh, my God. What a fun day.
That sounds great.

37
Yeah, all right.

38
Okay, well, I'll bring them by
tomorrow morning.

39
Okay, and by the way,
they're not actually puppies.

40
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
Okay, see you.

41
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

42
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

43
...asked me to babysit the triplets.
I'm nervous. I've never done that by myself.

44
Don't worry about it, Phoebe. We'll do it.

45
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

46
Come on, Chandler. Come on,
it'll give us great practice for when...

47
...people with babies come to visit.

48
Nice car.

49
Yeah, it's, uh... It's not mine.

50
- I love your car.
- Yeah. It's mine.

51
- I bet it's fast.
- Me too. Yeah.

52
And comfortable.

53
- Do you, uh, like leather seats?
- Yeah.

54
It's got them.

55
So I still have boxes here.

56
I still have boxes at Ross'.

57
And I have nowhere to live.

58
Wow, I could so easily
freak out right now.

59
What about me?

60
I just found out Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

61
Well, maybe I could be your roommate,
Pheebs.

62
Maybe you could be my roommate.

63
- Well, there's an idea.
- Yeah.

64
- That would be great.
- Oh.

65
- Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
- Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.

66
Oh! December 26th.

67
Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.

68
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

69
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2...

70
...and I picked up all the forms.

71
I'll take care of everything.

72
Sure, if you say you're gonna
take care of everything...

73
...I have no reason to doubt you.

74
Give me those forms.

75
All right, now, I'm gonna do this my way,
and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

76
- Okay, Rach, but...
- Ah, you're peeping.

77
Ross, you know what? I just got...

78
- Why? Why did you do this?
- Look, I told you...

79
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."

80
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

81
Well, you know what?
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

82
Oh.

83
Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think
I've ever been this angry.

84
What about the time I said
we were on a break?

85
Oh.

86
Pheebs, how's it going?

87
I'm doing okay. Do you think they're
having fun? Am I talking too fast?

88
No. You sound like me.

89
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

90
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.

91
You know what, Pheebs?

92
When you're done over there,
we've got a kind of situation over here too.

93
Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

94
See, that's where I think you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

95
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

96
What do you mean?

97
I just think things will go smoother...

98
...if we each have our own zone, you know?
Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.

99
And, Mon, you can be in charge
of diapering.

100
And I can be in charge of looking at how
cute they are when they put their hands...

101
That sounds really great,
but you should be in charge of wiping.

102
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

103
Wow, this is so great.

104
This is exactly how we set the plates
at the restaurant.

105
Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.

106
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

107
Hey, babies.

108
I'm having the best morning.

109
That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

110
Shocking, since you still have the keys.

111
You should see the treatment I get
when I'm with that car.

112
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

113
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

114
What equity investments?

115
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

116
I figured, if people keep seeing me
just standing there...

117
...they're gonna start to think
I don't own it.

118
So I figure I'll wash it, right?
Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?

119
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...

120
...and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

121
You don't even have a car.

122
I know. But one time there was this
dirty car parked in front of the building...

123
...so I washed it.

124
- And?
- And six others.

125
There you are.

126
- Yeah, she tops out at 130.
- Wow.

127
And that's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

128
Really? You got a place upstate?

129
Sure.

130
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Take it easy.

131
Hey. That's my car.

132
Really? Oh, uh...

133
Just give me five more minutes.

134
What are you doing?

135
Well, I found the keys,
and now I'm just polishing her up.

136
- But it's my car.
- Yeah, but it's my wax.

137
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

138
And I don't know if you're crazy
or if this is some kind of street theater...

139
...but could I have my keys?

140
Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.

141
I'm not coming back.

142
- Why not?
- I live upstate.

143
Yeah, so did I.

144
I don't know why I was so nervous
about this...

145
...and I don't know why Frank and Alice
are always complaining. This is easy.

146
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

147
Check it out. Check it out.
When the babies wake up...

148
...they can meet Krog.

149
What are you doing?
That thing could put someone's eye out.

150
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

151
No, Chandler, they could swallow
one of those little parts.

152
And also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

153
They're not gonna swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

154
When I was a kid, my mom used to
just throw me into a pile of broken glass.

155
- What?
- Glass, sand, whatever.

156
Oh, look at little Leslie
stretching in her sleep.

157
Oh, it's so cute.

158
I wonder what age it is when you stop
putting both legs behind your head.

159
Oh, I can still do that.

160
How are you still single?

161
All right, ahem. I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.

162
Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

163
- Good. What made you change your mind?
- I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

164
How did that happen?

165
Well, I was trying to prove
that I was right, you know?

166
And it turns out I was wrong...

167
...and now it's lodged in my throat.

168
Damn it, this whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...

169
...and no one was watching Chandler.

170
Okay, you two are asking the court
for an annulment?

171
Yes, Your Honor.
And here are our forms, all filled out.

172
So based on your petition...

173
...you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...

174
...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."

175
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

176
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user."

177
- What?
- Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.

178
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

179
Well, you would know.

180
Now, it also says here that you:

181
"Lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."

182
- Oh, come on.
- Ross, please. I found the magazines.

183
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."

184
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

185
Okay, you know, I'm sorry,
this is insane.

186
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem...

187
...with my ability
to consummate anything.

188
Look, I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now.

189
That won't be necessary.

190
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

191
Now, if you two were involved in a serious
relationship, that really creates a problem.

192
Your Honor, rest assured,
that relationship ended two years ago.

193
And can you please strike "consummated
like bunnies" from the record.

194
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

195
Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

196
And, uh, the names, I think.

197
Well, based on what I've heard...

198
...you two certainly don't qualify
for an annulment.

199
If you don't wanna be together,
you'll have to file for divorce.

200
That's great. You happy now? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

201
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

202
And what...?
What are you typing that for?

203
She already said
we don't get the annulment.

204
Don't type that. What...?

205
Stop typing. Hey.

206
Stop typing.

207
Stop typing, "stop typing."

208
Okay, okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

209
You need to get out of my chambers.

210
All right, lady, here's the deal.

211
I came here for an annulment,
and I'm not leaving here until I get one.

212
- Would you like to spend the night in jail?
- Thank you for your time.

213
That Porsche guy took his car back.

214
But you found the keys to his clothes?

215
No, I just, uh...

216
I love the way it feels when everybody
thinks I own a Porsche.

217
People would think you own a Porsche
because of the clothes?

218
Of course.

219
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

220
That is true.

221
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

222
Oh, I've been there.

223
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

224
Joey, you know you don't
actually have one.

225
Come on. What are you doing?
I'm in character. Will you talk to her?

226
Ah, I think it just moved.
It's really poking me.

227
That's it. We're going
to the emergency room.

228
What? No, you can't leave me here
with them. We're babysitting.

229
The babies are asleep.
I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.

230
But you can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

231
We're playing a zone.
They're gonna triple-team me.

232
He's got something plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

233
But, no, because a doctor won't be able to
help him. And it's just gonna, you know...

234
...naturally pass through his system
in, like, seven years.

235
- I think that's gum.
- I'm pretty sure it's gun.

236
Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.

237
But no. A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

238
No. What would Krog do?

239
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

240
Maybe because you've got the keys?

241
- That was totally your fault.
- My fault? You threatened the judge.

242
Well, you ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine.

243
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

244
Oh.

245
Hi. How are the Gellers?

246
Don't call us that.

247
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.

248
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

249
Hey.

250
It's "Porsche."

251
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

252
You guys feel safe, right?

253
Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do."

254
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie.
I'll set you up with a nice clean one.

255
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up, okay?

256
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.

257
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

258
Okay. Good.

259
Why are there only two of you?

260
Where's Leslie?

261
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

262
Leslie, now would be a good time
for your first words.

263
Well, look at you.

264
Hey.

265
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh.

266
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

267
Well, it'll dry.

268
Okay, you sit with your brother
and sister now...

269
...who aren't there.

270
- Hey.
- How do you feel?

271
Well, let's just say that Krog will be
equipped to destroy the universe again...

272
...in 12 to 14 hours.

273
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

274
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

275
And protected them from a tornado?

276
Oh, my God.

277
I know. The babies are asleep.

278
Phoebe, what happened here?

279
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

280
- But my apartment.
- Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

281
But the mess.

282
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe
took care of the babies all by herself.

283
You're right. You're right,
I shouldn't freak out.

284
This is what it's gonna be like
when we have babies.

285
When will that be?

286
Phoebe, would you take a look
at this mess?

287
Oh, honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

288
I picked up the divorce papers.

289
Uh, I've already signed everything.
And I put little X's where you need to sign.

290
Oh, little X's. Great.
That makes up for everything.

291
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

292
Oh, name one stupid thing
that is as stupid as this one.

293
Okay, how about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

294
How about you told me you loved me
after I was married?

295
Wait a minute, that was different.

296
I did those things
because I was in love with you.

297
Yeah. Right.

298
You're right. That's very different.

299
So let's just sign the papers.

300
- What?
- Nothing.

301
Okay, can we just sign, please?

302
Mm-hm.

303
Congratulations.

304
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...

305
I, uh, kind of have a little confession.

306
What?

307
Uh, well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

308
Kind of my idea.

309
Excuse me?

310
Remember how we were too drunk
to remember anything...

311
...the night we were married?

312
Yeah?

313
And yeah,
I didn't really wanna say anything...

314
...but it just kind of kept
coming back to me.

315
Um, remember, we were in the casino...

316
...and for some reason, you thought it'd
be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

317
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

318
So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then...

319
...to eat a lot of grapes.
- To eat a lot of grapes.

320
So, um...

321
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

322
So then, I mean, if you think about it...

323
...this is all your fault.

324
Yeah, don't push it, though.

325
I gotta say...

326
...I know I divorce a lot of women.

327
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

328
I know.

329
I always thought if you and I got married,
that would be the one that stuck.

330
And it wouldn't be a secret...

331
...and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

332
Did I even treat?

333
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

334
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard in my life.

335
Well, I should probably get these
to my lawyer's office.

336
Hey, thanks, Ross,
for taking care of all this.

337
- Ah, no problem.
- Yeah.

338
- I'm gonna need a copy of those.
- Totally.

339
Yeah.

340
Hey, hey, hey.
Careful around my Porsche.

341
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

342
How you doing?

343
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

344
I'd love to show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

345
Hey, would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

﻿1
- Okay.
- Aah.

2
Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you
are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.

3
- Right, and when is that due?
- First of the month.

4
And that's every month?

5
No, just the months
you actually want to live here.

6
Ah.

7
Okay, here's the phone bill.

8
Oh, my God!

9
That's our phone number.

10
Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

11
- So why don't I just cover you for a while?
- No, no. No way.

12
Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...

13
...anymore.

14
- It's not charity, Joe.
- No, forget it.

15
Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

16
All right? I can take care of myself.
Now, what's next? Come on.

17
Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.

18
- This is how much we pay for electric?
- Well, yeah.

19
So we'll do the rest
of the bills later, then?

20
So is Joey gonna have to give up
the apartment?

21
I hope not. I tried to offer him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

22
How much do you think he needs?

23
I figure $1500 would cover him
for a few months, you know...

24
...but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

25
Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him
as an actor?

26
You could have him dress up
and put on little skits whenever you want.

27
Well, that would help the pride thing.

28
- Hey.
- Hey.

29
Wow, you look great.
Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?

30
- Okay.
- Okay.

31
What do you girls
have planned for tonight?

32
Instead of being sad
that tonight's my last night with Rachel...

33
...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:

34
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

35
- And also my birthday. Ha, ha.
- It's not your birthday.

36
What a mean thing to say.

37
I would never tell you
it was not your birthday.

38
- Hey.
- Hey.

39
Hey, so you guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

40
Well, instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

41
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Knicks' season opener tonight.

42
I thought maybe you guys
would come and watch it.

43
I don't know, Ross.

44
Not if you talk about
how you gave up basketball...

45
...to become a paleontologist.

46
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist.

47
- Pheebs, I was wondering...
- You're not dressed yet?

48
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

49
Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.

50
Rachel, you are packed, though, right?
I mean, please tell me you're packed.

51
Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.

52
I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion
on what I should wear.

53
My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.

54
Oh, my God.

55
Monica's just gonna kill you.

56
I know.

57
What you're wearing is fine for that.

58
You're not packed!

59
You're not packed even a little bit.

60
Surprise.

61
Don't get mad,
because, look, this is what happened.

62
So I started packing, and then I realized,
"What am I doing?"

63
I am lousy at packing, right?

64
But you love packing.

65
So as a gift to you on our last night...

66
Ta-da.

67
I'll be coordinator.

68
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

69
Oh.

70
Look, everybody has to help.
Phoebe, you can help, can't you?

71
I have plans.

72
- You have plans with us.
- That's right.

73
All right. Chandler can make boxes,
Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.

74
- Tell the guys they have to help out.
- Okay.

75
- Okay.
- My God, thank you.

76
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack.
She's got jobs for everyone.

77
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves.

78
Okay.

79
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel has not packed.

80
Now, everybody has to help. Chandler...

81
No, I have plans with Joey.

82
- I thought you said you were doing nothing.
- Yes, but for the last time.

83
Okay, fine. Now, Ross...

84
- Oh, but I can't do it.
- Why not?

85
- Don't you have Ben?
- Because I have Ben.

86
It's almost 8:00, it's almost past
his bedtime. Where is he?

87
He's at a dinner party.

88
Is he really coming?
Because I can see into your apartment.

89
Of course he is. Uh, what?

90
You think I'd just use my son
as an excuse?

91
What kind of father do you think I am?

92
All right. Sorry.

93
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

94
Here it is.
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

95
I wish I'd known you were gonna do that.
I ordered Chinese.

96
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

97
Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

98
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

99
...you, the food of yours.

100
Huh?

101
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea
for what to do on our last night.

102
What do you say we play a little,
uh, foosball for money?

103
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

104
It'd be easier if you'd
just give me your money.

105
Yes, it would.

106
Ahem. What do you say to $50?

107
- Okay, you're on.
- Okay, let's play.

108
The big game. Italy versus...

109
...China, apparently.

110
Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.

111
Oh, God.

112
You remember when we got these?

113
No.

114
Oh, I guess you weren't there.

115
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

116
Come on. Hey, ha, ha,
remember the time?

117
You don't remember?

118
Sorry, Pheebs.
I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.

119
I'm gonna miss you so much.

120
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad
though, you know?

121
Instead of thinking about how much
you're gonna miss about each other...

122
...you should, like, think about
some of the things you're not gonna miss.

123
I don't think there's anything.

124
Come on, there's gotta be something.

125
Nope. She's perfect.

126
I have one.

127
Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.

128
Uh, well, I guess
I'm not gonna miss the fact...

129
...that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.

130
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

131
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

132
- Aw, sometimes.
- Ha, ha.

133
Always, actually.

134
Good. There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

135
It's not just the phone pen.

136
It's just that I never get my messages.

137
You get your messages.

138
Well, I don't think it counts
if you have to read them off your hand...

139
...after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

140
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

141
Or your mom?

142
Or Chandler?

143
Or your mom?

144
Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.

145
- Yes.
- Ah.

146
I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like,
500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoo!

147
Man. Five hundred dollars.

148
That is a lot of electricity, huh?
Woo-hoo!

149
Ooh, I gotta buy some food.

150
Okay, okay. Give me a chance
to win my money back. Sudden death...

151
...one goal, $1000.

152
- You serious?
- Oh, yes.

153
Okay.

154
- Get ready to owe me.
- Okay.

155
Okay, here we go. Ready?

156
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

157
No one can beat me.

158
See, now that's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

159
Hello?

160
Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.

161
Ooh, your brother. Score.

162
- What's up?
- I'm here with Ben.

163
Thought we'd say hi.

164
- Put him on.
- Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

165
Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

166
Uh, he's smiling, though.

167
Okay, talk to you later.

168
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

169
Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.

170
You know what else I'm not gonna miss?
"I'm Monica.

171
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it."

172
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight? No?

173
Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."

174
"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages
from interesting people. Ever."

175
Hey, I call her.

176
"Oh, my God. I love Ross.
I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."

177
"Oh, my God.
I can't find a boyfriend.

178
So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall
and sleep with the first guy I find in there."

179
Yeah, we should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

180
Still broken?

181
It sucks, man.

182
Your last night here, and I lose the two
most important things:

183
The foosball table...

184
...and $500.

185
Well, you know, there are other ways
you can win back your money.

186
- How about blackjack?
- Ah, not my game.

187
Okay, uh, you know what?
We can play a new game.

188
- A new game. It's fun.
- What's it called?

189
Cups.

190
- I don't know how to play Cups.
- I'll teach you. It's really easy and fun.

191
- All right.
- Okay, here you go.

192
I have two queens.
What do you have?

193
- A two and a five.
- Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.

194
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?

195
Ooh!

196
- What have you got?
- A four and a nine.

197
You're kidding, right?

198
- No. Why?
- Well, that's a full cup.

199
Damn, I am good at Cups.

200
I'm not talking to her.

201
One of you has to take the first step...

202
...and it should be you because
she's the one who's leaving.

203
It's harder for her.

204
Maybe you're right.

205
But she made fun of my phone pen.

206
I know. I took it hard too.

207
Listen, Rachel,
I feel bad about what happened...

208
- What are you doing?
- I'm unpacking.

209
- What?
- I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?

210
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

211
Hey, you know what?

212
You're the one who wants this
big change and move in with Chandler.

213
You should go.
Why do I have to leave?

214
- Because It's my apartment!
- Well, it's mine too. What else you got?

215
How about: You're moving!

216
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

217
Okay, Monica...

218
This is ridiculous.

219
We should be packing you.

220
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- Great. Monica's moving.

221
I am not!

222
Oh, really? Well, how come
all your stuff is in this box?

223
Okay, you guys, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here.

224
Okay? You guys? Stop!

225
I know that you're acting mad because
you think that will make it easier to leave.

226
But deep down, you're still really sad.
Deep, deep down.

227
- No, Phoebe, I am mad!
- Well, deep, deep, deep down.

228
Yeah, I'm just mad.

229
Then keep running.

230
You win.

231
- What did you have?
- Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...

232
...a three and a six.

233
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

234
Okay, now,
how much have you won so far?

235
- Wow. Seven hundred.
- Not 700 exactly?

236
- Yeah.
- Heh. Double it.

237
- What?
- Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...

238
...you have to double it.

239
- Really?
- Hey, I didn't make up the rules.

240
Okay, so now, after you receive
the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.

241
Now, that one card could be worth $100,
which brings your total to 1500.

242
- Ooh.
- No, no, no.

243
Don't get too excited, because that's not
gonna happen unless you get the... No way.

244
Well, this is the last box of your clothes.

245
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

246
Funny, I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

247
Okay, you guys, I don't mean
to make things worse, but...

248
...I don't wanna live
with Rachel anymore.

249
- What?
- You're just so mean to each other.

250
And I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

251
Well, Phoebe, that's fine
because I'm not moving.

252
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

253
You know, I know I said
some bad stuff...

254
...but Rachel does have some qualities
that make her a good roommate.

255
Oh, really? Like what, Monica?

256
You know how she has 147,000
pair of boots?

257
Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.

258
- She lets you borrow them.
- Yeah.

259
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

260
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold.

261
She gets tons of catalogs...

262
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages
of the things she thinks I'd like.

263
- What else?
- Uh...

264
When I take a shower...

265
...she leaves me little notes
on the mirror.

266
Yeah, I do. I do do that.

267
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

268
When I fall asleep on the couch
after reading...

269
...she covers me over with a blanket.

270
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

271
And when I told her I was
gonna be moving in with Chandler...

272
...she was really supportive.

273
You were so great.

274
You made it so easy.

275
And now you have to leave.

276
And I have to live with a boy!

277
It's gonna be fine.

278
Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait
to live with you.

279
You know what we should do?

280
Bring Monica, and then
we can all live there together.

281
We'll have so much fun!

282
But, honey, I think she's moving in
with Chandler.

283
Oh, that's right.

284
You're still set on that?

285
Kind of.

286
Oh, my God.

287
Hello? Hey, Mon.

288
How's the packing going?

289
Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right...
Oh, my God.

290
Get your head out of your shirt there,
son.

291
What?

292
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

293
Hey.

294
- What's wrong?
- Ross and I were helping the girls pack...

295
...took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups.

296
Wha...? How did you lose at Cups?

297
The same way you lost.

298
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three.

299
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom. Ross gets a four and five.

300
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

301
...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile,
I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.

302
Oh, man.

303
He never played before either.

304
You know what I think? I think
beginner's luck, very important in Cups.

305
Let's just play one more hand.
One more hand.

306
No, no more. I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

307
In fact, look. There's...
I wanna give you something, okay?

308
And let me give it to you now
before I pawn it for Cups money.

309
Now, I want you to have
the big, white dog...

310
...as a... Kind of a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

311
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.

312
It's "him." Not "it."

313
Well, what if I bought it from you,
you know?

314
And then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

315
Say $1500?

316
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

317
You're trying to give me money again.

318
When did I try to give you money?

319
Before, over there with the bills.

320
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

321
Okay, then we had a nice
last night together.

322
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

323
Now, out of the blue,
you start with the charity thing again.

324
I'm just trying to help you out, okay?
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

325
I will be okay. Look, Chandler.

326
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself, okay?

327
Look, I'm not gonna miss you
helping me out with money.

328
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

329
...is you.

330
And now the dog.

331
Hey.

332
- Call me when you get there, okay?
- Okay.

333
I'm really gonna miss you.

334
Oh, I have your key.

335
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

336
Oh, God, this is silly.
I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.

337
Bye, house.

338
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

339
Hey.

340
- She really left.
- I know.

341
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

342
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

343
What the hell is that dog doing here?

344
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

345
- And now you want that money back?
- Exactly.

346
Chandler, what kind of idiot
do you take me for?

347
It's not a real game. I made it up.

348
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

349
At a fake game!

350
Now, if you wanna try
to make some of it back...

351
...I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

352
I am very good at Cups.

353
Okay, now, I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last?

354
- No.
- Hmm.

355
Let's see if it comes up this time.

﻿1
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

2
- Hi. Rachel. Phoebe's.
- It's. And.

3
- Please.
- Leave.

4
Leave.

5
But I just said "leave."

6
Yeah, I know,
because you have all the good words.

7
What do I get? I get "it's, and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.

8
- Come on, that's silly.
- All right. So let's switch.

9
No, I have all the good words.

10
Okay, fine, fine. We can switch.

11
- Okay.
- Okay.

12
- Hi.
- Everybody.

13
- It's.
- Rachel.

14
- And.
- Phoebe's.

15
Pleas... Wait. How did you do that?

16
What?

17
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

18
Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later?
I wanna go running before it gets dark.

19
- Why don't you come with me?
- Really?

20
Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.

21
We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first,
you know, roommate-bonding thing.

22
Okay, let's go running!

23
- Yeah, and there's cute guys there.
- Let's run towards them!

24
Okay.

25
Wait just one more second.

26
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

27
Now, wait a minute.
You just took all the words.

28
Uh-huh. You've met your match,
Rachel Green.

29
- So I just finished this fascinating book.
- Hmm.

30
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

31
...that can carry out the same amount
of functions as an actual human brain.

32
So, theoretically,
you could download...

33
...your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

34
...and live forever as a machine.

35
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

36
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

38
- I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
- Oh, so you can move them.

39
Yes.

40
Yes, and while I'm doing that,
Ross has a great computer story for you.

41
Hey, everybody.
Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.

42
She's gonna be my new roommate.

43
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
And she's gonna live with me!

45
It's nice to meet you. Janine?

46
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.

47
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

48
So, uh, where are you from?

49
Australia. I just moved here
a couple of weeks ago.

50
- From the land down under?
- Yeah.

51
I didn't know that either.

52
So, what do you do?

53
- I'm a dancer.
- You're a dancer?

54
She's a dancer.

55
- Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
- Here, let me...

56
- Joey?
- Yeah?

57
Did you even interview this woman
before you asked her to move in?

58
- Of course I did.
- Uh-huh.

59
What exactly did you ask her?

60
When can you move in?

61
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

62
Unbelievable.

63
Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?

64
Hey, look at all the boxes.

65
I cannot wait to ask her out.

66
Wait a minute, Joey.
Joey, you can't ask her out.

67
She's your roommate.
It'll be way too complicated.

68
Yeah, man, don't do it.

69
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

70
Think about it. Remember when you were
going out with Donna and you broke up...

71
...remember how horrible it was when
you bumped into her at the supermarket?

72
Oh, God, yeah.

73
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

74
Okay.

75
- No, no.
- Oh. Oh.

76
You're right. I don't want that.
I can't date her.

77
And you'd better watch the flirting too,
because in close quarters...

78
...it could be trouble.
- Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

79
I mean, it's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

80
Heh. Well, you're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

81
A little sad about that, sweetie?

82
I have to tie my shoes,
so you go ahead. I'll catch up.

83
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
Come on, that's not running.
Let's go!

85
You guys, I'm telling you,
when she runs...

86
...she looks like a cross
between Kermit the Frog...

87
...and the Six Million Dollar Man.

88
Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.

89
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

90
I used to do that too.

91
Oh, my God. Did you also have his album,
It's Not Easy Being Green?

92
Oh, Mon.

93
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

94
Yeah. And you know what?
And I know she's gonna want to run again.

95
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

96
Why don't you just be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

97
You're right. You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

98
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me.
I don't think I can ever run again, ever.

100
Why? Why would you do that?

101
I don't know.

102
Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.

103
- Ankle.
- We'll see.

104
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

105
Thanks for helping me, man.

106
Joe?

107
Well, I guess Joey went home.

108
Oh, and look, there is still one box
that I have to unpack.

109
I got you.

110
Oh, my God,
you almost gave me a heart attack.

111
It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.

112
Hey, the place looks great.

113
Yeah, not bad, right?

114
You know what? Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

115
You know what else I'm gonna do?

116
I'm gonna go downstairs,
I'm gonna get her some flowers.

117
Now, who would not want
to live with me?

118
I don't.

119
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer.

120
How's that going, though?
Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?

121
Yeah, so far. Yeah.
But it's tough, you know?

122
I've got all this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

123
How you doing?

124
Oh, man.

125
Sorry. There's just more room out here.

126
Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

127
- Why don't you try to be?
- Aah!

128
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

129
I just... I didn't want you to touch me...

130
...because I'm all sweaty
from the workout. Ha, ha.

131
I'm gonna hit the shower.

132
Oh, my God.

133
Oh, sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

134
It's just my thongs are too delicate
for the dryer.

135
- Aah!
- Hi.

136
Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.

137
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

138
You lied so you could run by yourself.

139
No, Phoebe, no. I was... No.

140
I was actually just checking...

141
...to see...

142
...if I could run. And I can.

143
Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.

144
No, wait. Phoebe?

145
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

146
So, Mondler...

147
Uh...

148
What, uh...? What are you doing?

149
What does it look like? I am cleaning.

150
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all of her stuff?

151
Authorizat... I don't need that.
I'm gonna put everything back.

152
Put it back exactly where you found it?

153
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

154
Okay, first of all,
that attitude is not helping.

155
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

156
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

157
She's gonna recognize
that I did a nice thing...

158
...and appreciate it.

159
Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.

160
Because when you have to move back
with Joey...

161
...Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

162
Oh, I see, I see.
You're trying to freak me out.

163
Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

164
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years.
She's going to freak out.

165
Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.

166
No, she is not, okay?
I'll prove it to you.

167
I'm gonna call her right now.

168
Phone's done.

169
- Hi.
- Hey, Mon. How's it going?

170
Terrible. If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

171
Other people just wreck stuff.

172
I really think
I might kill someone tonight.

173
Oh, come on, come on,
it can't be that bad.

174
It's worse.
The only thing getting me through...

175
...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.

176
- I might get out of here early.
- No. No, no, no.

177
No, no, it sounds like
they need you there.

178
- You're just hanging out with Ross?
- It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.

179
She's gonna kill me.

180
The phone was facing the other way.

181
And that goes back up there.

182
Know what we should do?
We should start with the big stuff.

183
That'll be the easiest.
So, uh, let's start with the couch.

184
I got it.

185
Yeah, that doesn't look right.

186
What are you talking about? The couch
is perfectly in line with the carpet.

187
Then I can just walk over here
and casually just put my feet right up on...

188
Okay, here's what we do.

189
We just move the couch closer
to the coffee table.

190
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the back of the carpet.

191
Okay, well, here,
we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...

192
...closer to the couch.

193
No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

194
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table... Ross.

195
Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?

196
I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame.

197
What the hell's going on over here?

198
Monica's gonna kill you.

199
Look, I need your help, okay?

200
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

201
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

202
You guys repel women all the time.

203
Hey, I've been married three times.

204
No, no, no, I've seen it happen.

205
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

206
What's your secret?

207
Look, we do not repel women, okay?

208
That is completely untrue.

209
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

210
Remember back in college
when we went to that dance...

211
...and you walked right up to that girl
you liked and couldn't stop talking...

212
...about the Irish potato famine?

213
Yeah, well, what about you?
You weren't so hot in college either.

214
After everything he said, he'd go:

215
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either.
Maybe I should stop doing that.

216
You know what? Girls don't like it
when I start talking about science.

217
That's not specific to girls.

218
This is great. This is great. What else?

219
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

220
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

221
You know, they don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

222
- Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
- I'm never gonna find love again.

223
Hey.

224
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

225
Okay. Um, I...

226
Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry, okay?

227
I handled the situation horribly.

228
And I should not have lied to you.

229
So what should you have done?

230
Well, I should have told you the truth.

231
Uh-huh. Which is?

232
Well, you know, the reason that
I didn't want to go running with you is...

233
...because, um...

234
...well, you know, the way that you run
is just a little...

235
- So?
- Well, it's embarrassing.

236
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

237
- Why do you care?
- Because they're people.

238
But people that you don't know
and will never see again.

239
Yes, but still they are people...

240
...with eyes.

241
Well, I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss:

242
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

243
But, oh, okay.

244
No, no, I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

245
Yeah, okay. You're uptight.

246
What? I am not uptight. Whoa.

247
Listen, I am not uptight, man.

248
That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

249
Me, I'm more free, you know?
I run like I did when I was a kid...

250
...because that's the only way it's fun,
you know?

251
I mean, didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

252
...you know, like, when you were
running towards the swings...

253
...or running away from Satan?

254
The neighbor's dog.

255
Okay, is this lamp in the right place?

256
Who cares? I repel women.

257
No, no, no! You can't come in here.

258
Ross is naked!

259
- What?
- What?

260
I couldn't say that I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

261
Why does anyone have to be naked?

262
Why is Ross naked?

263
I had to show Chandler something.

264
Naked?

265
Yeah, I uh...

266
I guess I have, a, uh...

267
A guy problem.

268
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?

269
Look, just come back later.

270
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later.

271
Okay. Hey, listen.

272
There's still some of Chandler's medicine
left under the sink in the bathroom.

273
- Bye.
- Bye.

274
Thank God.

275
Dude, what'd you have?

276
Look, we have no time, okay?
We must focus.

277
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

278
The photo album.

279
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

280
We just go through it
and match everything to the pictures.

281
- That's perfect. That's brilliant.
- Yeah.

282
So really, what did you have?

283
Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.

284
Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?

285
Sure.

286
Listen, I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

287
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

288
Is there something wrong?

289
All right, all right.

290
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?

291
You're hot.

292
I'm lovable.

293
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

294
But we're roommates...

295
...and it's a huge mistake for us
to continue down this road.

296
- Joey...
- No, no, no. I'm telling you.

297
Imagine yourself living in a supermarket
and you'll understand.

298
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

299
Well, I don't think
there is anything to do.

300
I mean, I think you're really sweet.

301
But I'm just not interested
in you like that.

302
Oh.

303
No, I mean...

304
You're a really nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

305
I'm just, you know, I just...

306
...don't feel that way about you.

307
Oh.

308
I see what happened. Ha, ha.

309
It's because I was trying to repel you.

310
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

311
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

312
How you doing?

313
I'm okay.

314
What?

315
Oh, dear God.

316
Choo, choo, choo.

317
- Hey!
- Hi!

318
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great.

319
See? And you don't care
if people are staring.

320
It's just for a second,
because then you're gone.

321
It's amazing, Pheebs.
I feel so free and so graceful.

322
Oh!

323
Ha! Hey, look out for the horse.

324
Sorry.

325
Is it okay for me to come in now?

326
Uh-huh.

327
- Why is everything different?
- Bye.

328
I don't see anything different...

329
...other than the fact that the room got
so much brighter when you came into it.

330
Well, the end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

331
...and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

332
Okay, look, don't be mad, okay?

333
But after I unpacked the boxes,
I wanted to do something nice for you...

334
...so I cleaned the apartment.

335
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

336
...where it went back. And I'm sorry,
I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

337
That's okay.

338
Chandler, are you afraid of me
or something?

339
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

340
Of course not.

341
My gosh, Chandler,
what you did is a wonderful thing...

342
...and I really appreciate it.

343
I know I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

344
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

345
Really?

346
Of course.

347
Oh, you're the best.

348
You come here to me.

349
Hold on, okay? First things first.

350
Okay. Now...

351
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

352
So it said that by the year 2030...

353
...there will be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

354
...as an actual human brain.

355
So theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

356
...and your memories
into this computer...

357
And live forever as a machine.

358
Uh, so, Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

359
You and I, we're interfacing.

360
Yeah. I gotta go.

﻿1
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

3
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.

5
Is Janine around?

6
She's at dance class.

7
Can I check my room?

8
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
Oh, my God.

10
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
It is?

13
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
No.

15
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

16
- No.
- No.

17
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

18
This is a "guy's" place.

19
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

20
- You're right. I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her. Be a man.

21
- I'm a man.
- Defend yourself.

22
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

23
Be right there, sweetums.

24
Totally different situation.

25
Hey, guys.

26
- How was breakfast with Hillary?
- Okay.

27
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
Is this Hillary,
your hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
- Yeah.
- The one that stares at me?

30
No. The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
Why don't you set us up?

33
Ooh, are you setting Ross up
with someone?

34
Does she have a wedding dress?

35
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
Rachel, I'm making up flyers
to try to get new massage clients.

37
So can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copy machine?

38
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird
considering I don't work there anymore.

39
Oh, my God. What happened?

40
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

41
Well, that's great. Congratulations.

42
A year ago.

43
You've lasted all year. Good for you.

44
But, Pheebs, you could still use
the copy machine where I actually work.

45
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

46
Kim will freak out.
She already doesn't like me.

47
- I don't think my boss likes me.
- I don't think mine likes me either.

48
Maybe it's a universal thing.

49
Or maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

50
Yeah, let's head off to work.

51
- Thank you.
- Sure.

52
You will not believe this.

53
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

54
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

55
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.

56
- Good kisser.
- What?

57
What?

58
- You kissed him?
- Totally.

59
Phoebe, are you serious?

60
Yeah, I was just in there,
he came in and introduced himself.

61
The next thing I know,
we're making out.

62
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

63
No.

64
Phoebe.

65
What am I supposed to do, ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

66
No, yeah, I should.

67
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

68
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

69
Do you, uh, know this kid?
Is it a relative?

70
No. I just thought it was cute.

71
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Okay, uh...

72
Look, Janine, I really want you
to feel at home here, but...

73
...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

74
Oh. Like what?

75
Uh, like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

76
We can't have that.

77
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

78
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.

79
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

80
I'm sorry. I just thought
I'd try and make the place a little nicer.

81
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.

82
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

83
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

84
- I just thought...
- I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

85
But come on.

86
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

87
It's a curling iron.

88
Oh. Well, that's okay then.

89
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

90
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

91
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

92
- It's clean.
- Yeah, well, it feels different.

93
It's dry.

94
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

95
Okay, also, what is with
these chips you bought?

96
No, no, no. It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

97
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

98
Oh.

99
Kim, hi.

100
Uh-huh.

101
So I handed in that marketing report,
and I never got to hear what you thought.

102
- I didn't read it.
- Ah.

103
So, wow, the spring line's really
gonna be great this year, huh?

104
Yeah.

105
So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

106
Tell me everything.

107
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

108
What's up?

109
You know...

110
Oh, my God.

111
What happened to your teeth?

112
I whitened them.

113
Really?

114
Yeah, what do you think?

115
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

116
Come on, seriously.

117
- They're really, really, really white.
- What was wrong with your old...

118
...human teeth?

119
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

120
- How much longer?
- A day.

121
Ross, tonight is your date with Hillary.

122
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

123
No. No, no, no.

124
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

125
She will be after tonight.

126
Oh, Rach.
Uh, do you notice anything...?

127
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

128
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

129
...but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

130
- What?
- Oh, my God.

131
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

132
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

133
...it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

134
I am proud of all my friends today.

135
Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe
made out with Ralph Lauren.

136
Ugh. I'm so jealous.

137
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

138
Chandler, please. Come on.

139
Look at him.

140
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

141
Hey.

142
Here. Ooh.

143
Who's the silver fox?

144
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

145
Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

146
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

147
What?

148
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look
like that guy.

149
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack...

150
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy.

151
What?

152
Oh, God... I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

153
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!

154
Why would the copy guy
say he's Ralph Lauren?

155
To get you to make out with him.

156
Oh.

157
Okay, maybe this will make them
look less white.

158
Nope. Heh.

159
Okay, so colors that don't work are...

160
...blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

161
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

162
Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

163
Oh, great. So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

164
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you...

165
Whoa, whoa.

166
We're not 13 anymore.

167
Ross, this is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

168
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

169
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

170
What?

171
Half the people... I mean...
Just try it and see.

172
No, I am not putting on makeup.

173
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

174
No! Demon! Demon!

175
Now our drawers will smell nice,
and we didn't waste these pantyhose.

176
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

177
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

178
We're supposed to organize
the wrapping paper.

179
Yes, but I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side enough today.

180
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

181
This has been kind of a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

182
It's okay. I just feel like I need
to be in a guy place...

183
...do kind of a man thing.

184
Go over to Joey's and...

185
...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

186
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

187
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

188
I'm sorry. We do. We do.

189
I don't know why I said that.

190
Hey, Chandler.

191
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

192
No, thanks, Josephine.

193
Ross, I was wondering if...

194
Oh, my God. Where are all the men?

195
- Oh. Hi, Kim.
- Hi, Rachel.

196
Uh, remember that thing that happened
yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.

197
You didn't cancel the fabric order
from Taiwan?

198
Okay, two things didn't happen.

199
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

200
Well, it turns out that's not true.

201
It's not true?
Oh, that's interesting.

202
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copy machine...

203
...yesterday during lunch,
and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.

204
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God,
you think I made out with him?

205
Listen to me, if you think sleeping
with Ralph is gonna get you my job...

206
...you are sadly mistaken.

207
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.

208
Oh, this is such a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

209
Nobody made out with him.
I did not use my keycard yesterday.

210
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

211
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

212
Yeah. Nothing happened.

213
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

214
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

215
Mm-hm.

216
And someday soon,
I hope to open my own restaurant.

217
Mm.

218
You know, you're a really great listener.

219
Most guys I go out with,
they just talk and talk.

220
After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

221
I've probably been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

222
Come on, I want to know.

223
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

224
I came to the city for college.

225
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

226
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you. Hmm?

227
So if you sear the stems
of the flowers first in a frying pan...

228
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

229
Joey, that is such a great tip.

230
Monica, can you excuse us?
I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.

231
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.

232
I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

233
...out of just a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

234
Aw. I love birds.

235
What is the matter with you?

236
- What?
- You're arranging flowers.

237
You got dead flowers.

238
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers.

239
This is not Joey.

240
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?

241
Flowers, they're just, you know,
nice to look at.

242
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

243
You're turning into a woman.

244
No, I'm not.

245
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

246
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

247
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

248
Oh, my God.

249
I'm a woman.

250
So now she thinks that I made out with him
and that I did it to get her job.

251
- Why didn't you just tell the truth?
- I did.

252
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

253
Well, what if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

254
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

255
Did she ever think of that?

256
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?

257
- Just for a second.
- Ugh.

258
- Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
- Well...

259
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

260
I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

261
Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.

262
- That wouldn't help me.
- Oh, yes, it would.

263
- I've had a really good time tonight.
- Mm-hm.

264
You know, I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

265
Me neither.

266
Uh, I've had a really
good time too, you know.

267
Are you gonna eat that bread?

268
Oh, I just like the smell.

269
Mm.

270
You make me laugh.

271
Would you like to move over
to the couch?

272
Mm-hm.

273
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

274
How about all the way?

275
Okay.

276
Wow, cool poster.

277
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

278
So, uh...

279
...where were we?

280
Are those your teeth?

281
Oh.

282
You can see them, huh?

283
Yes. They're insanely white.

284
I did that for you.

285
What's the matter with you?

286
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999.

287
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

288
Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

289
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

290
Okay, look.

291
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

292
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

293
Oh, really?

294
Yeah, he dumped me.

295
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

296
Even though you're a very, very...

297
...very beautiful woman...

298
...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

299
And I don't know why, but he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

300
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

301
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

302
You expect me to believe...

303
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

304
Oh, my God.

305
He just gave you the coldest look
I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.

306
Then it is true.

307
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

308
Oh, honey, come here.

309
Oh, it'll be okay.

310
We've all been there.

311
You and Ralph?

312
Kenny the copy boy.

313
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
- Uh, I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter? You upset?

315
I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of
all this girlie stuff in here.

316
I, uh... I gotta be a man.

317
Okay? The living room
has to remain a guy place, okay?

318
That's just the way it has to be.

319
If that's what you want,
I'll just put it all in my room.

320
Good. Great.

321
And, uh, thanks for being
so understanding.

322
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

323
But you could, uh, put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

324
I mean, if you want to.

325
Okay.

326
And, uh, maybe the watering can there.

327
Sure.

328
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

329
Joey, do you want me
to put it all in your room?

330
Okay.

﻿1
Okay, great. Bye.

2
So guess who's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner.

3
Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.

4
I miss Rachel.

5
No, my parents.

6
Oh, great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.

7
Yeah, and if you could not mention
that we live together, that'd be great.

8
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.

9
Why can't I tell them
we live together?

10
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?

11
Why haven't you told them?

12
Um, well, I was going to. I really was.

13
But, um, then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.

14
Why haven't you told them?
Wouldn't they be happy?

15
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.

16
Why wouldn't they be happy?

17
Well, um, because...

18
...mainly, um...

19
...they don't like you.

20
- I'm sorry.
- What? Why? Why?

21
Maybe because you used to be aloof...

22
...or that you're really sarcastic
or that you joke around all the time...

23
...or that you take off your clothes
and throw them on the couch.

24
Is this why they don't like me
or why you don't like me?

25
I know I should have told them.
I know I shouldn't care what they think.

26
I'm sorry.

27
You know, it'll be okay, because
when they come over, I will be charming.

28
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.

29
You think that'll work?

30
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't I?

31
I don't think you'll ever get
my parents that drunk.

32
Hey. Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?

33
Yes, of course they like you.

34
Monica told me they don't.

35
Yeah, they don't like you.

36
Do you know why?

37
Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic,
or maybe it's because you...

38
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess.

39
Great. Another Thanksgiving
with nothing to give thanks for.

40
Maybe I give thanks
for you shutting up, huh?

41
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my new apartment.

42
Maybe I love you.

43
- Hi.
- Hi.

44
Hey, guys.

45
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey.

46
Are you guys going
to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?

47
Yeah, why, what's up?

48
Well, me and my dancer friends
are doing Thanksgiving uptown.

49
I thought you might like to come.

50
For real?

51
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.

52
We'll probably just drink all day.

53
- We go to yours.
- Yeah.

54
Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.

55
But, you know, actually, uh,
growing up with a sister was nice...

56
...because it really helped me
understand women.

57
Yeah, you should tell your friends that.

58
Okay.

59
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.

60
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
Pheebs, check it out.
For my dessert...

62
...I have chosen to make
a traditional English trifle.

63
Wow, that sounds great.
And what are you making, Monica?

64
In case Rachel's dessert
is so good that I eat all of it...

65
...and there's none left
for anybody else.

66
Nothing.

67
Nothing?

68
No, sweetie. I trust you.

69
So if I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?

70
You're not gonna mess it up.

71
Wow, Monica, I love that.
You really have faith in me. Thank you.

72
Technical question: How do you know
when the butter is done?

73
Well, it's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.

74
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
- Oh. The food smells great, Mon.
- And the place looks so nice.

76
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

77
Happy Thanksgiving.

78
- Well, this has been great.
- See you.

79
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

80
- Where you going?
- Oh, oh.

81
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.

82
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?

83
Some would say she's attractive, yes.

84
Who else is going to be there?

85
- Uh, some of her friends.
- Her dancer friends?

86
Yes. All right?

87
All of her hot dancer friends
are gonna be there...

88
...and they'll be drinking and dancing
and we really want to go.

89
Dude, we were good.

90
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.

91
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls...

92
...is not very Thanksgiving-y.

93
Oh, but it is.

94
Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving
when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.

95
Yeah, and then the Indians
taught the Pilgrims...

96
...what it meant to be hot
in the New World.

97
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

98
Hi, Dad. Mom.

99
Look. Look who it is.
It's Chandler.

100
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.

101
Mr. And Mrs. Geller,
you look wonderful.

102
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.

103
Whoa, it snowing out there?

104
No.

105
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.

106
You should think about doing this
for a living.

107
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.

108
Dad, Chandler was laughing at your joke.

109
My joke wasn't funny.

110
Rach, I just remembered.

111
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.

112
Really?

113
Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me
from a burning building...

114
...and he was so brave and so strong.

115
And it's making me look at him
totally differently.

116
You know, I mean, he used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."

117
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."

118
I don't know.
To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...

119
...walks in while you're changing."

120
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
of Ross' very best friends.

121
Ross sure is a great guy.

122
You know, I've always felt that
how a young man turns out...

123
...is a reflection on his father.

124
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?

125
He's a headliner of a...

126
...gay burlesque show.

127
Rach, you're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?

128
There's drunken dancers a-waiting.

129
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

130
Yeah. What is it?

131
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.

132
First there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam...

133
...then custard,
which I made from scratch...

134
...then raspberries,
more ladyfingers...

135
...then beef sautéed
with peas and onions...

136
...then a little bit more custard...

137
...then bananas and then
I put whipped cream on top.

138
What was the one right before bananas?

139
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.

140
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced meat pie."

141
That's an English dessert.

142
These people just put
very strange things in their food.

143
By the way,
can I borrow rum from your place?

144
Yeah, sure.

145
And while I'm gone,
don't you boys sneak a taste.

146
- Okay.
- Okay.

147
Beef in a dessert?

148
No, no, no. There is no way.

149
I know. And only one layer of jam?

150
What is up with that?

151
Oh, my God.

152
- The pages are stuck together.
- Chandler.

153
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and...

154
...half a shepherd's pie.

155
Man, now she's gonna start all over.

156
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.

157
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.

158
Just let her serve
the beef-custard thing?

159
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.

160
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.

161
Joey. God, your apartment
is like a hundred degrees.

162
Did it make you want
to walk around in your underwear?

163
No.

164
Still not hot enough.

165
Rachel. Okay, look at him.

166
Look at those strong hands.

167
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be that can of condensed milk.

168
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.

169
Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.

170
Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful
and it's cream-colored and tight and...

171
I don't mean tight. It's not too tight.
Not that I was looking at...

172
What's the matter with him?

173
I think he's stoned again.

174
- What?
- What?

175
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.

176
Okay, I think I might know
why my parents don't like you.

177
- You do? Why?
- Okay, remember we were young. Heh.

178
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom...

179
...and my parents walked in
and smelled it...

180
...so I told them that you had gotten stoned
and jumped out the window.

181
What? Why did you do that?

182
I don't know. Uh, yours was the first
name that popped into my head.

183
I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.

184
How could it not matter?

185
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college...

186
...let alone
you'd be living with my sister?

187
What about all that
"friends forever" stuff?

188
I don't know. I was all high.

189
Mom and Dad just sent me to find out
if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

190
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
in college, and he blamed it on me.

191
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.

192
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, okay? So fix this.

193
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.

194
Now, who should I say it was?

195
You. It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.

196
All right. Now, who should I say
tricked me into doing it?

197
Dad.

198
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.

199
- And if you're gonna put your feet up...
- Monica, leave him alone.

200
Will you hurry up?

201
Did you not hear me when I told you
that all of Janine's friends are dancers?

202
Huh? And that they're gonna
be drinking a lot?

203
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.

204
You're whipping so slow.
Can't you do it any faster?

205
Joey, come on,
I don't want to make any mistakes.

206
This is the only dessert. If I screw it up,
everybody's gonna be like:

207
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

208
So just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.

209
Oh, I am.

210
- Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will.
- Okay. Fine.

211
- Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, uh...

212
Can it wait a second, Joey?
I have to tell my parents something.

213
No, it can't? Okay.

214
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel
she messed up her dessert.

215
What? What is with everybody?

216
It's Thanksgiving, not...

217
...Truth Day.

218
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing...

219
...they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?

220
Okay. We'll just get everyone
to act like they like it.

221
That way, no one makes fun of her...

222
...and we still get to go
to sweet potato pie.

223
Dude, they're not objects.

224
Oh.

225
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.

226
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

227
Okay.

228
What's up, Ross?

229
So, um...

230
Thanksgiving.

231
The holiday season is upon us, hmm?

232
Yeah.

233
And, um...

234
...you look nice today.

235
- Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
- What?

236
I just don't think us getting back together
is a good idea.

237
Huh?

238
I thought this might happen today.

239
Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...

240
...and it's probably really hard
for you to be alone right now.

241
You're alone.

242
No, I live with Phoebe.

243
I mean, you're alone-alone.

244
And it's just not the time for us.
I'm sorry.

245
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.

246
And, uh, if anyone needs help
pretending to like it...

247
...I learned some things in acting class.
Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.

248
Or, uh, saying "Mm."

249
And, uh, oh, smiling.

250
Okay?

251
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.

252
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already.

253
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You know what? You don't get any dessert.

254
Really?

255
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.

256
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.

257
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?

258
- It sure is.
- Wow.

259
So did you make it
with beef or eggplant?

260
- Beef.
- I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.

261
Aw.

262
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.

263
Really?

264
Wait, you only got whipped cream.

265
You gotta take a bite
with all the layers.

266
Okay.

267
You dropped a pea.

268
Well?

269
Mm.

270
It's good.

271
Really? How good?

272
It's so good that I feel really selfish...

273
...about being the only one
who's eating it.

274
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.

275
Especially Ross.

276
Mm-hm.

277
Mm.

278
Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.

279
So that I can enjoy the view
whilst I enjoy my dessert.

280
I've gotta call my friend...

281
...and tell her how good
this is from Monica's room.

282
I'll help you dial.

283
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...

284
...so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.

285
Okay, what was that all about?
Does it not taste good?

286
- Let me try it.
- No, no.

287
All gone.

288
So good.

289
Maybe Chandler has some left.

290
It tastes like feet.

291
I like it.

292
Are you kidding?

293
What's not to like? Custard, good.

294
Jam, good. Meat, good.

295
So a bird just grabbed it...

296
...and then tried
to fly away with it...

297
...and then just dropped it
on the street?

298
Yes, but, if it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it...

299
...he seemed to enjoy it.

300
Rachel, come here.

301
Okay.

302
I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap
and I had another dream about Jack.

303
- Phoebe, do I want to hear this?
- I don't know, let's see.

304
Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...

305
...and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.

306
And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.

307
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.

308
Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...

309
...and he kicked his ass
for betraying me.

310
It was so cool.

311
Then he took me diving
and introduced me to his pet sea horse...

312
...who was coming on to me.
And, please, that is not gonna happen.

313
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.

314
Five minutes ago, a line like that
would have floored me.

315
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.

316
Ross? Let's go.

317
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...

318
...I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.

319
You know what?
That's it. You've had your chance.

320
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.

321
- What?
- What?

322
You are such a tattletale.

323
Mom, Dad, heh...

324
...you remember that time
you walked in my room...

325
...and smelled marijuana?

326
- Yes.
- Yes.

327
I told you it was Chandler...

328
...who was smoking the pot but...

329
...it was me. I'm sorry.

330
It was you?

331
And, Dad, you know that mailman
that you got fired?

332
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.

333
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
the porch swing. Monica did.

334
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year.

335
Monica and Chandler
are living together!

336
Ross married Rachel in Vegas.
And got divorced. Again!

337
I love Jacques Cousteau.

338
I wasn't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

339
I want to go!

340
That's a lot of information
to get in 30 seconds.

341
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.

342
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

343
It did not taste good.

344
Phoebe, I'm sorry...

345
...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.

346
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact...

347
...that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.

348
And we kind of figured
about the porch swing.

349
Ross.

350
Drugs?

351
Divorced again?

352
What happened, son?

353
I... I, uh...
I got tricked into all those things.

354
Chandler, you've been
Ross' best friend all these years...

355
...stuck by him
during the drug problems...

356
...and now you've taken on
Monica as well.

357
Well, I don't know what to say.

358
You're a wonderful human being.

359
- Thank you.
- No.

360
Thank you.

361
Monica and Ross, I don't know
what I'm gonna do about the two of you.

362
I'll talk to them.

363
You guys, it was bananas...

364
...cream and beef.

365
I just cannot believe that you ate that
so that I wouldn't feel bad.

366
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.

367
No it isn't, I ate that.

368
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.

369
Nope, got it and got yours too.

﻿1
Hey, what's going on?

2
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

3
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar"?

4
Yeah, I'll take that.

5
What's up?

6
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

7
Congratulations. Where is she?

8
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay!"

11
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

12
I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!

13
Shut up.

14
No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!

15
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

16
My fiancé will kick your ass.

17
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

18
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

19
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, shh.

20
Okay. Um.

21
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

22
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

23
Our special night.

24
It just wouldn't be my night... Our night...

25
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

26
It's okay, I want this to be your night too.

27
To Monica.

28
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
- Okay, to Monica.
- To Monica.

30
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding, because I'm kind of musical.

31
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

32
Speaking of chiming in,
remember burning my apartment?

33
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

35
- Oh, okay!
- Yeah.

36
I can't stay too long.

37
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

38
I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.

39
What?

40
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

41
You guys don't think I look 19?

42
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

43
Oh.

44
- Okay, everybody, let's go.
- Okay.

45
Is my candy bar around here?

46
No, you ate it all.

47
I was afraid of that.

48
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

49
Diamond shoes.

50
You're not getting dressed.

51
Know what I mean?

52
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

53
There's gonna be a wedding.

54
You're gonna be the bride.

55
Two hundred people are gonna be
looking at you in a clean, white dress.

56
Let's do it.

57
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

58
You're tired, you had a lot of champagne.

59
Don't worry about it.

60
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

61
You know? It's like biology.

62
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

63
...and tonight biology failed me.

64
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in, okay.

65
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

66
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

67
Phoebe, no.

68
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

69
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

70
- Hey, you look great.
- Hey.

71
Oh, thanks.

72
You okay over there?

73
I don't know. You know? I feel a little...

74
You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.

75
Don't worry about it. You're probably tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

76
It happens to everybody.

77
- Hey. Wow.
- Hi.

78
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

79
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

80
Well, sure, but I get married all the time.

81
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

82
Do you think we'll ever have that?

83
You mean "we," you and me?

84
Oh, no, no, no.

85
"We," you with someone, me with someone.

86
Good, you scared me a minute.

87
I know. Shake it off.

88
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

89
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like there was...

90
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

91
Oh, well, yes.

92
- I can think of one good thing.
- What?

93
You were always good at the...

94
...at the, uh, the stuff.

95
Yeah, I...

96
I was good at the stuff?

97
Mm-hm. Yup.

98
I really liked your hands.

99
- My hands?
- Yeah.

100
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

101
Way to go, guys.

102
You were really good at the stuff too.

103
Oh, I know.

104
Hey, you know what we never did?

105
Oh, no, not that.

106
We never had bonus night.

107
- A what?
- You know, bonus night.

108
Two people break up,
but they get back together for one night.

109
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

110
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.

111
- No.
- No.

112
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

113
Um, I mean...

114
...I'm sure it would be amazing...

115
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

116
I really...

117
...really...

118
...don't.

119
What's up?

120
What's up, dude?

121
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

122
You playing a little PlayStation, huh?

123
That's wack.

124
PlayStation is wack.

125
What's up with the wack PlayStation,
what's up?

126
Huh?

127
Come on, am I 19 or what?

128
Yes, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being the dumbest a person can look...

129
...you are definitely 19.

130
Come on, really. How old?

131
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

132
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

133
- Oh, thanks.
- Okay.

134
- Joe.
- Yeah.

135
Uh.

136
You've had a lot of sex, right?

137
When, today?

138
Some, not a lot.

139
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a, uh...

140
I was unable to...

141
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

142
There, ha, hm.

143
There was an incident.

144
Don't worry about that, man. That happens.

145
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

146
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

147
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

148
Come on.

149
Why aren't you dressed yet?

150
I wrote the best song for your wedding.

151
- Check this out.
- Phoeb.

152
If you get ready now, you can play.

153
- Really?!
- Yes.

154
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

155
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

156
Fair enough. Get ready. I'll get everybody.

157
Finally we can start celebrating my...

158
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

159
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

160
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

161
- What?
- I waited my whole life to be engaged.

162
And unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

163
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped
tonight could just be about that.

164
- Oh, honey, but it is.
- No, it's not.

165
Now it's about you getting back together.

166
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

167
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

168
- Yeah, no, and nobody even saw.
- Yeah.

169
That's true.

170
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

171
You guys kissed?

172
What does this mean?

173
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

174
Thunder being stolen.

175
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

176
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

177
Oh, my God.

178
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

179
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and woman.

180
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

181
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

182
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

183
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

184
No, it's not huge.

185
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

186
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

187
We're still talking about it.

188
That, and Chandler's problem.

189
Monica, listen, listen.

190
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

191
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

192
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

193
Yes, you can pass for 19.

194
- Really?
- Yes.

195
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

196
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

197
I'm 30!

198
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

199
Oh, crap!

200
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais?
Maybe no more for you though.

201
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

202
- Why?
- This is ridiculous.

203
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

204
Pssh. That is wack.

205
Yeah?

206
I'll play it at the wedding.

207
Yeah, well, we'll see if they
actually let you play, huh?

208
They tell you anything you want to hear...

209
...like, "You look 19."

210
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

211
Monica won't take this away.

212
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

213
Would she?

214
You ate my candy bar!

215
Guess who.

216
Hey.

217
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

218
What did Monica mean:

219
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

220
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

221
Still thinking about it?

222
I'm serious. What did she mean by that?
"Especially you."

223
- Oh, who cares?
- I care.

224
And so do I.

225
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

226
Okay, sure.

227
Am I going to let you watch me?

228
No.

229
I can't believe her. It's just so typical.

230
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

231
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

232
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

233
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

234
Keep talking.

235
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

236
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

237
I love you.

238
Mmm.

239
Bonjour, monsieur.

240
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

241
It's Paris. Who knows we're here?

242
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

243
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

244
- What?
- Good-faith money to hold the date.

245
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

246
Oh, I see.

247
They break your heart, don't they?

248
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

249
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

250
Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you...

251
You got to do something about your eyes.

252
What's wrong with my eyes?

253
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

254
Put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.

255
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

256
Give her the deposit,
give her the ring. I don't care.

257
- Yes?
- What did you mean when you said...

258
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

259
What a great apology.
And you accept it. Bye-bye.

260
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

261
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

262
Wha?

263
Hey, here's a thought...

264
Monica, what are you talking about?

265
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

266
Ah, third base.

267
It was all everybody could talk about.

268
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

269
- We had a caricaturist.
- Oh.

270
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

271
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

272
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

273
Yet here you are doing it again.

274
Oh, I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.

275
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

276
Got me.

277
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

278
It'd be nice if I could have this night.

279
I never wanted any part of your night.

280
No one was supposed to see us.

281
Is that why you did it in the secret hallway,
where nobody ever goes?

282
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.

283
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

284
I'm calling it off.

285
Way to save your dignity, my man.

286
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

287
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

288
Maybe you thought you'd get married first.

289
Maybe you can't stand...

290
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married first.

291
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

292
Now I want to steal your thunder.

293
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

294
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

295
Well, somebody should.

296
Look, if we're gonna do this...

297
We're not. She's just gonna think we are.

298
I see, so everybody wins.

299
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

300
Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.

301
Ow!

302
Yeah, you like that, baby?

303
May we help you?

304
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

305
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

306
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

307
How is that ever going to happen?

308
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

309
- I know why.
- You don't.

310
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

311
What do you mean?

312
Look, I am so...

313
...so happy for you guys.

314
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

315
I'm not even close.

316
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

317
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

318
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

319
I don't care, she slept with me.

320
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

321
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.

322
I'm gonna take off.

323
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

324
- And Rachel.
- Yeah.

325
What can I say?

326
You missed your chance.

327
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

328
We thought Phoebe would leave

329
But she just stayed and stayed

330
That's right, I'm here all night

331
And Chandler will never get...

332
Hey, here's a dollar.

333
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

334
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay.

335
Now who will perform the ceremony?

336
Who will perform the cer...?

337
Oh, oh.

338
I'll pound on him in the morning.

﻿1
Bye-bye.

2
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

3
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

5
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

6
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
- Aw.
- Oh.

8
- Pheebs?
Uh-huh?

9
Skull?

10
Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.

11
Oh, my God!

12
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

13
It belonged to my mom.

14
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

15
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

16
And you can put candy in it.

17
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
Licorice?

19
Sure. Ha, ha.

20
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

21
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

22
I know Susan does every year.

23
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

24
And maybe I could teach Ben...

25
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

26
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

27
Mm.

28
Hey.

29
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

30
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

31
Lovely.

32
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you, uh...

33
...change your name to "Bing"?

34
No.

35
Why not?

36
Bing's weird.

37
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
Hey.

39
Guess what?

40
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

41
I guess I'll be moving out.

42
Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

43
Yes, you will be very sad.

44
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- Oh. You'll be living together again?

45
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

46
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

47
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

48
No reason, except she...

49
...told me.

50
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

51
No. No, she didn't say that.

52
I think you should talk to Monica now.

53
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

54
You're absolutely sure?

55
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

56
Oh, probably?

57
I don't like that word.

58
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

59
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

60
You know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

61
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

62
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

63
History teaches us nothing.

64
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
You're home.

66
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

67
- Drums?
- No, drums!

68
Could we get
two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.

69
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

70
Um, we have a reservation under Bing.

71
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

73
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

76
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

77
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

78
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

79
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

81
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

83
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
You don't feel...

85
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

86
Well, I do. So let's...

87
So, Ben, you, uh...

88
You know what holiday is coming up?

89
Christmas.

90
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

91
Christmas Eve.

92
Yes, but also...

93
Hanukkah!

94
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

95
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

96
Right, um, but on Hanukkah...

97
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

98
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

99
Jingle bells, jingle bells

100
Okay, that's right. Yes...

101
...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:

102
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay

103
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

104
Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.

105
When is Santa coming?

106
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

107
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

108
No Santa?

109
Was I bad?

110
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

111
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

112
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

113
You're his favorite little guy.

114
So Santa's coming?

115
Yes!

116
Santa's coming.

117
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

118
Shake his hand and give him the money.

119
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

120
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

121
We'd be eating our soup right now.

122
Mustached bastard.

123
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

124
Excuse me.

125
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we please?

126
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

127
Ha!

128
So you like the drums.

129
That's great.

130
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

131
...an unbearable living situation.

132
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

133
Hey, we already learned a song.

134
Ready? One, two, three, four.

135
Tequila!

136
That's fun.

137
Here you go.

138
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

139
Definitely not easier with coins.

140
Thank you.

141
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

142
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

143
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

144
If you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

145
...why not something more subtle...

146
...like a wrecking ball...

147
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

148
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

149
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

150
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

151
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

152
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

153
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

154
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

155
Maybe on some level.

156
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

157
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

158
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

159
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

160
Okay, what is it?

161
It's a...

162
...tarantula!

163
Oh.

164
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

165
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

166
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

167
What are you talking about?
I love them.

168
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

169
And then my cat died.

170
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

171
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

172
Oh, isn't that adorable?

173
- Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
- Oh.

174
He's so adorable.

175
He's so much fun.

176
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

177
Whoa. Wait a minute.

178
What's the matter?

179
Our apartment is ready.

180
And that makes you angry because?

181
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

182
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

183
...said you were having
so much fun here...

184
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantulas is gonna change that.

185
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

186
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

187
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

188
You know how fish freak me out.

189
Fish.

190
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

191
That's the deal.

192
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

193
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

194
Oh. It's so much more fun with you.

195
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

196
They say if we want,
we could see it tonight.

197
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

198
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

199
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

200
Um, ahem.

201
Done.

202
Hey.

203
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

204
No, these are my pants.

205
Oh.

206
Okay.

207
- How can I help you?
- Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?

208
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

209
Okay, look.
Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?

210
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

211
Um, come on,
you gotta have something.

212
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

213
I'm a friend of Santa's...

214
...and he sent me here to wish you...

215
...a merry Christmas!

216
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

217
Santa was unavailable...

218
...so close to Christmas.

219
Come in, have a seat.

220
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

221
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

222
I'm Santa's representative...

223
...for all the Southern states.

224
And Mexico!

225
But Santa sent me here...

226
...to give you these presents, Ben.

227
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

228
Wow, thanks!

229
You're welcome, Ben.

230
Merry Christmas. Ooh.

231
And happy Hanukkah!

232
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

233
You are? Me too.

234
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

235
You want to wander in the hall?

236
Oh. Hey, Ben!

237
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

238
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

239
Cool!

240
Come on, Ben.

241
Years and years ago...

242
...there were these people called...

243
...the Maccabees!

244
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!

245
Santa!

246
Hey.

247
What are you doing here, Santa?

248
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

249
What are you doing here...

250
...Weird Turtle Man?

251
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

252
...your part-Jewish friend.

253
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

254
Remember?

255
What?

256
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

257
You bet I did, Ben.

258
Put her there.

259
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

260
Ho-ho-ho.

261
Ben, come open more presents.

262
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

263
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

264
What are you doing?

265
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

266
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

267
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

268
- Why?
- Because...

269
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

270
...and you're wrecking it.

271
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

272
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

273
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

274
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

275
Santa, really?

276
Yeah, is that okay?

277
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

278
- No.
- Then it's okay!

279
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

280
Say goodbye.

281
No, why does he have to go?

282
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

283
...Armadillo...

284
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

285
...the universe will implode!

286
Merry Christmas!

287
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

288
Fine, I give up. Santa...

289
Santa can stay!

290
Well, I'll stay...

291
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

292
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

293
...and learn about Hanukkah?

294
Okay, Santa.

295
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

296
All right, it's time...

297
...for the story of Hanukkah.

298
Years and years ago...

299
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

300
Merry Christmas!

301
Oh, wow, look at this place!

302
Oh, this is terrible.

303
They've made so many changes...

304
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

305
Oh, new sconces!

306
- Oh, my God!
- What?

307
Remember, uh, how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

308
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

309
And that the landlord
might find out...

310
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

311
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

312
It left. It's one huge room.

313
Oh, no!

314
Wow!

315
See?

316
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

317
- You can't because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

318
Wow!

319
Oh. So should we start looking
for a new place?

320
You know, I'm sensing...

321
...that, um, my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

322
Oh, yeah?

323
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

324
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

325
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

326
You heard it too? You have the gift.

327
Phoebe, it's okay.

328
I like living with Joey.

329
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

330
...it's closer to work.

331
And we do have fun.

332
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

333
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

334
Oh. Did you hear that?

335
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

336
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

337
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

338
No, I do not hear that.

339
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

340
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

341
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

342
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

343
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

344
My favorite part...

345
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

346
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

347
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

348
...the Hanukkah candles!

349
Ho-ho-ho.

350
Hey.

351
- Oh.
- Wow.

352
Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

353
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

354
Oh, oh.

355
I understand why Superman is here...

356
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

357
- You get it?
- I got it.

358
Back in the cage?

359
It's back in the cage.

360
Is the cage closed?

361
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby?

﻿1
Oh. Mm.

2
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
You have got to try this cheesecake.

4
Oh, you know,
I'm not that much of a sweet tooth...

5
- Oh, my God, it's so creamy.
- Oh.

6
Oh, my God. That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had.

7
Where did you get this?

8
It was at the front door when I got home.
Somebody sent it to us.

9
Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.

10
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.

11
Thief.

12
I didn't read the box before I opened it...

13
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it.

14
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious.

15
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake.
That is wrong.

16
No, no, no, it is going to be okay...

17
...because Mrs. Braverman
is gonna send away for a free one.

18
And that way, we all win.

19
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate:

20
"Mama's Little Bakery."

21
I feel terrible.

22
I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.

23
Well, I'm sorry, what?

24
I should get going. Big day at work.

25
You know how I'm in a coma?

26
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

27
So...

28
Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.

29
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

30
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

31
- Absolutely. Okay.
- All right, I'll see you at 8.

32
Oh, what's at 8?

33
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.

34
We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you guys.

35
Wow. Did not know that.

36
May I say how lovely you look today?

37
Duly noted.

38
Oh, so for tomorrow...

39
...do you want to rent a car
and drive down together or what?

40
What are you talking about?

41
Cousin Frannie's wedding.
It's tomorrow night.

42
You were invited?

43
No.

44
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

45
I knew Mom and Dad were invited.
I thought that was it.

46
I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

47
Well, maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

48
Look, it's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?

49
Maybe you are invited and the invitation
just got lost in the mail.

50
Yeah, well, you call her and tell her
that, you know, when we were kids...

51
...her precious little Frannie
tried to undress me several times, okay?

52
If I hadn't stopped her, there probably
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

53
She tried to undress me too.

54
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

55
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

56
Um, I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

57
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.

58
I had plans with Joey tonight,
and he left me this note.

59
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

60
Big Daddy."

61
- "Big Daddy"?
- Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.

62
Hey, you know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

63
- Hey.
- Oh, here's Joseph Francis.

64
Whoa, what are you
middle-naming me for?

65
I left you a note.

66
So what? That doesn't give you
the right to ditch me.

67
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

68
Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.

69
I don't accept this rule.

70
When we make plans,
I expect you to show up.

71
Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

72
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends
are gonna come and go, but this is for life.

73
Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

74
Well, it does.

75
Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?

76
I'm sorry.

77
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

78
Okay, you wore me down.

79
Joe, while you're over there, how about
another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

80
"Ross..." Is that back?

81
- Hi.
- The other cheesecake came.

82
They delivered it
to the wrong address again.

83
So just bring it back downstairs.
What's the problem?

84
I can't seem to say goodbye.

85
Are you serious? Chandler,
we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...

86
...and you want more?

87
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like, okay?

88
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

89
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham-cracker crust...

90
...with a very rich...

91
...yet light cream-cheese filling.

92
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva. Ahem.

93
Know what? Forget it.
We are just hungry.

94
We have not had lunch.
We are just lightheaded.

95
So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

96
We'll drop it off downstairs
so we're not tempted.

97
Where do you wanna go to lunch?

98
Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

99
Aw.

100
Mel Tormé died.

101
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

102
Oh, does that mean
the Sam Goody's sale is over?

103
- Hey.
- Hey.

104
So I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

105
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

106
Uh, there's limited seating in the hall...

107
Limited seating?
I am just one tiny person.

108
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

109
I mean, the last time she saw you...

110
...you would've turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

111
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

112
That's not the reason
why she's not inviting me.

113
What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

114
And you know what?
If it makes you feel any better...

115
...Joan and I will just
make an appearance...

116
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

117
- Joan?
- Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.

118
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department.

119
Tall, very beautiful.

120
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

121
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and guest"?

122
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and guest"?

123
Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

124
I think the rule applies here.

125
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

126
Not broad-back!

127
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

128
What? I can't cancel on Joan.

129
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

130
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department, okay?

131
They're wild.

132
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

133
...she's my cousin.

134
I mean, we grew up together.

135
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

136
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

137
I'll go call Joan.

138
Oh, that's nice.

139
Family should be there.

140
This is her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

141
We'll see. Ha, ha.

142
Well, thank you for lunch.

143
Wait a minute, I didn't pay.
I thought you paid.

144
So apparently,
we just don't pay for food anymore.

145
- Do you see what I see?
- Huh! It's still there.

146
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

147
She could be out of town.
Maybe she'll be gone for months.

148
By then, the cheesecake
may have gone bad.

149
We don't want her to come back
to bad cheesecake.

150
- That could kill her.
- Wouldn't want that.

151
No, we're protecting her.

152
- We should take it.
- But move quick.

153
- Why?
- I heard her moving around in there.

154
Go, go, go.

155
Oh, my God, that's David.

156
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

157
David that I was in love with.

158
David who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

159
Oh, my God.

160
Oh, you say someone's name enough,
they turn around.

161
- Phoebe.
- David.

162
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

163
Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.

164
Um, God, you look phenomenal.

165
Well, ha, ha...

166
Yeah.

167
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

168
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

169
Yeah.

170
- Um, look, I got a confession to make.
- Uh-huh.

171
Um, I was hoping to run into you here.

172
I didn't know that I should call or not.
You know, I was only in town a few days...

173
...and, you know, I didn't want
to intrude on your life or anything.

174
But I really wanted to see you...

175
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

176
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

177
Really?
Because I think about you all the time.

178
- Really?
- There's a statue in Minsk...

179
...that reminds me of you so much.

180
I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...

181
- ...but, you know, at certain angles...
- Yeah.

182
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

183
Yes.

184
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

185
- Uh, what?
- I can't.

186
I can't believe I have plans. I can't.
Can you do it tomorrow?

187
Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

188
Well, listen, you know,
next time you're in Minsk, uh...

189
- Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

190
What are you doing?

191
- Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
- So? He'll understand.

192
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

193
Monica, I made a whole speech about
how you do not cancel plans with friends.

194
And now, you know, what? Just because,
potentially, the love of my life...

195
...comes back from Russia just for
one night, I should change my beliefs?

196
I should change my beliefs.

197
No. No, no. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

198
God, you are so strong.

199
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and I could meet David at 9.

200
Oh, my God, that is so good.

201
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

202
...I'll regret it.

203
Hey, what have you got there?

204
Oh, it's, um...

205
- It's tofu cake. Do you want some?
- Aah.

206
- What are you doing tonight?
- Huh?

207
- Uh.
- Dude. Dude.

208
Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
Why?

209
Oh, really? Uh, Monica said
she had a date at 9.

210
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

211
After she gave me that big speech...

212
...she goes and makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

213
I think she's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

214
Here, I think this is us. Yeah.

215
Limited seating, my ass.

216
Let's just see who made the cut.

217
Hi. Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

218
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

219
Used to work with her. Used to.

220
I'm a relative and I didn't get invited,
okay?

221
A blood relative. Blood.

222
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

223
So how about you?
How do you know the happy couple?

224
We went to college with both of them.
And now we live next door.

225
Okay, you're fine.

226
- Hey. Are you guys ready?
- Hey. Yes.

227
I will have a green salad, um,
house dressing and water's fine.

228
- Okay.
- And for you, sir?

229
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

230
...just how slow are we talking?

231
It's already been roasted.

232
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
those specials again.

233
Oh, Joey, we've heard
the specials three times, okay?

234
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

235
- Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli.
- Oh, well, that changes everything.

236
- You know what, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

237
You were right before.
Friends are so important.

238
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

239
You know what I really want?

240
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

241
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

242
- Any progress?
- Yes.

243
I will have the lobster ravioli.

244
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

245
- What's the rush?
- Well...

246
...I just have, you know, an appointment.

247
And it's very important.

248
What is it?

249
Well...

250
...it's a date.

251
A date? No, no, Pheebs,
you must be mistaken...

252
...because you wouldn't
schedule a date...

253
...on the night you have plans
with a friend.

254
Come on.
Don't make me feel badly about this.

255
No, I'm gonna.

256
That's right.
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...

257
...about going out with that girl.

258
Like I did something terrible to you.
Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.

259
That's not the same thing.
This is totally different.

260
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

261
Okay, he's very special to me.

262
Okay, well, my girl
from the other night was special.

263
She was a scientist too.

264
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

265
Okay, whatever. Know what?

266
I don't have time to convince you.

267
He's only here for four hours
and I'm gonna go see him.

268
- Fine. Fine!
- Yeah. Yeah.

269
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli.

270
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
Oh, I was just about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

272
Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.

273
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

274
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

275
Come on, we're going to my place.

276
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

277
Mm-mm.

278
I will give you $100 to whistle right now.

279
How can you eat the cheesecake
without me?

280
What are you gonna do?

281
Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them what we did.

282
We are dessert stealers.
We are living outside the law.

283
You know what?
I don't trust you with this cake.

284
- And I got it first, and I'm taking it back.
- What?

285
- What? Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, yes.

286
You think I trust you with it?

287
We're gonna split it.
You take half, I take half.

288
That's not fair. You had some.

289
Oh, you know what? I think Monica
would be very interested to know...

290
...that you called her cheesecake
dry and mealy.

291
- What do we use to split it?
- Okay.

292
- All right, pick a half.
- Okay.

293
- Well, this side looks bigger.
- Mm-hm.

294
Uh, but there's more crust on this side.

295
Yeah. So maybe if I measure it...

296
For God's sake, pick a piece.

297
- All right, I pick that one.
- So the smaller piece.

298
Okay. There you go.

299
Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.

300
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

301
...if you eat your piece too fast.

302
Oh!

303
- You gonna give me some of your piece?
- Oh, no.

304
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

305
Ha, ha. I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

306
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

307
Never met a girl that could me feel...

308
Ross, sweetheart.

309
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

310
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

311
Every time, on the lips.

312
Why? Why on the lips?

313
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

314
Now, wait a minute.
You be nice, all right?

315
I didn't bring you here
so you could ambush her.

316
Frannie was the one who found
your Playboys and showed them to Mom.

317
That bitch.

318
Monica. What...?

319
Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?

320
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

321
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

322
You invite my brother, you invite
my whole family, and not me? Why?

323
Why wouldn't you want me
at your wedding?

324
What could I have possibly done?

325
Stuart.

326
I believe you know my husband.

327
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have possibly done.

328
- I hate this, but I have to go.
- Mm-hm.

329
I can't miss my flight.

330
Are you sure? I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

331
July.

332
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

333
"Please clean my beakers."

334
I don't get out of the lab much.

335
I thought it meant something else.

336
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say, um...

337
...that.

338
But, um, I figured
I probably shouldn't because...

339
...you know, I have to leave.

340
Hmm. No, you're right. Don't say it.

341
I do, though.

342
I do too.

343
Well, bye, Phoebe.

344
Okay, now's not the time, Joey, all right?
You can yell at me tomorrow.

345
No, no. No, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

346
I just started thinking
about you and David...

347
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

348
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

349
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

350
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

351
...and I may never see him again.

352
Hey, you could always visit him.

353
Oh, right.
Like they're gonna let me have a passport.

354
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

355
Well, now...

356
...if you achieve positronic distillation
of subatomic particles before he does...

357
...then he could come back.

358
I could give it a shot.

359
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

360
- Stick to your side.
- Come on, now.

361
All right, what are we having?

362
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.

363
Oh, okay, wait here.

364
Hi, sweetie. Are you leaving?

365
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

366
Why? Why on the lips?

﻿1
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

3
- No, no.
- Oh, God.

4
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

5
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

6
- Okay?
- Okay.

7
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

8
There it is. Oh, look at that!

9
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

10
That's a plane.

11
Well, all right, 1700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

12
...that's pretty amazing too.

13
- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
- No, you can't.

14
- What?
- I don't know.

15
Man, look at all those stars.

16
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

17
- Know what else makes you wonder?
- Huh?

18
Check out the rack on that chick.

19
We've been out here for two hours...

20
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

21
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

22
No, I'm not.

23
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

24
Because it's flattering!

25
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

26
- We're taking off too. We rented a movie.
- Oh, I won't say no to a movie.

27
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

28
- Shh. Get me out of here.
- Oh, okay.

29
- Hey, Ross.
- What?

30
- Check this out.
- Is it the comet?

31
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

32
I can't believe...

33
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

34
...one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

35
...and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

36
You know, there's two women, dude.

37
Show me where.

38
Right... Right up here.

39
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

40
I don't know.

41
Yeah, I do.

42
- Joey!
- What? Hey, don't look at me!

43
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

44
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

45
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from...

46
No! No!

47
No!

48
- Monica.
- She's sleeping.

49
I know. Just a quick question.

50
Which one was Deep Impact
and which one was Armageddon?

51
Deep Impact was the one
with Robert Duvall.

52
Armageddon is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

53
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

54
Ooh!

55
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

56
...and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

57
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like:

58
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

59
...and no one will
kick you in the shin.

60
What?

61
Ow!

62
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

63
Oh, thank God.

64
Hm.

65
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

66
I took out your battery! How can...?

67
Don't interrupt me!

68
Monica! Monica!

69
Come on!

70
I can't believe this!

71
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

72
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

73
Help us! Please, help us!

74
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

75
Ross.

76
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

77
I know. I wasn't finished.

78
But don't worry!

79
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

80
Shh-shh-shh!

81
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

82
With a wok?

83
I thought my boring book was gonna
put you to sleep.

84
It got interesting.

85
Damn you, Oprah!

86
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

87
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

88
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

89
Like when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.

90
- Okay, that does sound fun.
- Yeah.

91
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

92
The second sister dies?!

93
No.

94
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

95
The second sister dies in
Archie and Jughead Double Digest?

96
That's correct.

97
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

98
- Sure.
- Okay.

99
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

100
- If this is your idea of sexy talk...
- No.

101
Seriously. Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

102
What contracts?

103
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get. Heh, heh.

104
Like what?

105
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

106
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

107
Those contracts had to go out today.

108
You didn't give me any contracts.

109
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

110
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

111
Then I put a little heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

112
You never gave them to me.

113
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

114
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

115
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

116
- You want to go to the office now?
- No.

117
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

118
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

119
All right, get your coat!

120
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

121
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

122
We'll just have to jump.

123
Yep. Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

124
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

125
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

126
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

127
So when you get down there...

128
...you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

129
- Whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it?
- Yeah. You'll be fine.

130
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

131
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

132
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

133
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

134
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

135
- You call it in the air, all right?
- Oh, all right. Tail. Oh!

136
- Can you see what it is?
- No.

137
- Okay. Well, you be careful.
- No. No, Ross, stop.

138
I'm not jumping.

139
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

140
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

141
So it looks like we're even.

142
Okay, so this wire...

143
...is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

144
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do...

145
Okay.

146
Well done, Pheebs.

147
What do you want from me?!

148
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

149
What? What? What?

150
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

151
Okay. Feel free to look...

152
...but I'm telling you
those contracts are not on this desk.

153
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

154
This is what I'm talking about.
You have to be more organized.

155
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you... Oh!

156
And who's this chippy?

157
A little young for you, but whatever.

158
That's my sister.

159
Really? Very cute braces.

160
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

161
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

162
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

163
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

164
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

165
...that said:

166
"Must go out today."

167
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

168
Not here.

169
Puzzler.

170
Bit of a puzzle.

171
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

172
- How could I have left them in the copy room?
- I don't know.

173
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

174
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

175
- Fine.
- Thank you.

176
Hello?

177
I still don't get it.

178
You still awake?

179
Yeah. You?

180
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

181
Hey.

182
As long as we're both up...

183
Yeah?

184
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

185
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

186
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

187
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

188
I say we just break the window...

189
...crawl through...

190
...and you know, explain later.

191
- No one's home?
- I don't think so.

192
Hello?

193
So when you get in there...

194
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

195
Noisy bitch!

196
Oh, what? What are you doing?

197
Do you know what just happened?

198
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

199
No. We were in the middle of sex...

200
...and you fell asleep.

201
No. No, that's not true.

202
No, best time ever.

203
Yeah. You rock my world.

204
- Monica?
- What?

205
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

206
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

207
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

208
- Come on, big fella.
- Okay.

209
- Give me the good stuff.
- Yeah.

210
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

211
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

212
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

213
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

214
Hi. I got you some coffee to...

215
So you got anything for me?

216
- Still no luck.
- Oh, my God.

217
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

218
- Want me to check again?
- I wish you would.

219
Well, no, it's not in there.

220
How about that drawer?

221
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

222
I don't know.

223
I mean, let me check.

224
Any luck?

225
Can I see you in my office for a minute?

226
Yeah.

227
You found them!

228
I'm not even gonna gloat.

229
- I'm just really relieved it's...
- You put these on my desk.

230
- I did not.
- Oh, really?

231
So they slid out of your bottom drawer...

232
...crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

233
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

234
I am so hot for you right now.

235
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

236
Phoebe Buffay?

237
Fire Alarm?

238
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

239
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

240
- That's not mine.
- Yes, it is.

241
How do you know?

242
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

243
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica."

244
Do you have a search warrant?

245
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

246
Please reattach it.
It's against the law to disconnect them.

247
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

248
Press the reset button.

249
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

250
Oh. There's a reset button?

251
My God!

252
Why didn't I see that?

253
Reset button. Reset button.

254
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

255
God!

256
- Okay, you have a good grip?
- Yeah.

257
Okay, I'm gonna start
to climb down you now.

258
- All right, just hurry up.
- Okay.

259
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

260
...or should I climb down
your back so we're...

261
...butt to face?

262
- Face to face.
- I like face to face.

263
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

264
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

265
I prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.

266
When we talked about face to face...

267
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

268
- What do you want me to do?
- Just shimmy down me and drop.

269
- Hi.
- Hi.

270
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

271
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

272
- It still looks pretty far.
- It's not that far. Just drop.

273
Do not rush me!

274
Ross, my pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

275
Whoa!

276
Ow! My ankle!
I really hurt my ankle!

277
I think I twisted it when...
Ooh, a quarter!

278
That really was
some of your best work.

279
I told you.

280
I can't believe it.

281
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

282
I have to be up in seven minutes.

283
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes...

284
Really?

285
You want to?

286
Okay. You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.

﻿1
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hi.

2
Well, you know, I was thinking
of moving the couch over here.

3
Why would you want to do that?

4
So that there would be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

6
- Okay? Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

7
- No?
- No.

8
Rosita does not move.

9
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
As in "Rosita does not move."

11
Joey, it's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
The big deal is that it's the exact equal
distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
...and it's at the perfect angle so you
don't get any glare coming off of Stevie.

14
Stevie the TV?

15
- Is there a problem?
- No.

16
Oh, what does he know?

17
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.

18
Ow!

19
You bitch.

20
Hey, Ross?

21
So I was checking out
the real-estate section.

22
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

23
Oh, looks like Mom and Dad's house.

24
Oh, it even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

25
And the, uh, window in the attic...

26
Oh, my God.

27
What? What happened
to the window in the attic?

28
I can't believe Mom and Dad
are selling the house.

29
I can't believe they didn't even tell us.

30
I can't believe I still don't know
what happened to the window in the attic.

31
Okay, come on.
I'll buy you a new one, all right?

32
We'll go down to the store right now
and we'll get you a new chair.

33
She's not even cold yet.

34
But don't you think Rosita
would've wanted you to move on?

35
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

36
That's true.

37
Wow.

38
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

39
Man, some stranger's
gonna be living in my room.

40
Well, after 15 years of Mom and Dad
keeping it as a shrine to you...

41
...it's time the velvet ropes came down.

42
They kept your room a while.

43
Oh, please. Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

44
And I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

45
Not a gym.

46
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

47
I was their firstborn. They thought
she was barren. It's not my fault.

48
Ugh. I hate this year.

49
What's wrong with this year?

50
It's already February
and I've only given two massages...

51
...and they were both
the worst tippers in the world.

52
That was me and Ross.

53
Oh, that's right.

54
If you want to pick up some extra cash...

55
...some friends of mine made good money
in college doing telemarketing.

56
Yeah, it'd probably be better
than the last telephone job I had.

57
You know, I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

58
What?

59
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

60
So, basically, this is very easy.
You read from the script...

61
...and try to sell as much toner
as you possibly can.

62
Okay, I can do that.

63
- Oh, by the way, I love my office.
- Ha, ha.

64
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

65
Um, all right.

66
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

67
Can I speak to your supply manager,
please?

68
I'm the supply manager.

69
Um, okay. I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

70
- We don't need any toner.
- Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

71
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

72
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

73
Oh, well, all right.

74
Um, no offense,
but you were kind of rude.

75
They're always gonna tell you
they don't need toner, but that's okay.

76
Because whatever they say...

77
...you can find the answer to it,
here in the script.

78
- Oh.
- So I think you're ready to sell toner.

79
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

80
Oh, wait, yes, I do.
I do have one question:

81
What is toner?

82
Joey?

83
Joe?

84
Full bag?

85
Beer's still cold.

86
Something terrible
must have happened here.

87
Oh, no, no, no.

88
Stevie, I was never here.

89
- Dad?
- I'm here.

90
- Hey.
- Hi.

91
God, it seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

92
Dad, we can't believe
you're selling the house.

93
It's time for a new family
to start their memories here.

94
And hopefully their check will clear
before they find the crack...

95
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

96
Let's just grab our stuff
and get the hell out of here.

97
I'm sorry we can't store
your childhood things anymore.

98
Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see
everything again. All the memories.

99
I don't know what's in the boxes
down here.

100
But I do know that there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

101
I used to love to play restaurant.

102
Yeah, not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater."

103
Hey. It is unreasonable to expect a child
to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.

104
So I think your boxes are over here.

105
Oh, great.

106
Hey...

107
...Dad, whose cigarettes are these?

108
I don't know.

109
They must be your mother's.

110
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

111
Cool. Dad, my report cards.

112
Hey, check this out. Dad.

113
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym...

114
Ooh, my rock polisher.

115
- Uh-oh.
- What?

116
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

117
How are you ever gonna sell this place?

118
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

119
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

120
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

121
What the...?

122
Oh, God.

123
Everything's ruined.

124
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

125
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

126
No.

127
So it's just your mother, then.

128
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

129
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

130
Earl. Thanks.

131
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

132
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

133
I don't need any toner.

134
I'm hearing what you're saying,
but at our prices, everyone needs toner.

135
Not me.

136
May I ask why?

137
You want to know why?

138
I surely do.

139
Okay.

140
I don't need any toner...

141
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

142
Um...

143
Is that because you're out of toner?

144
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

145
No, no, wait, wait.
I can't just let you hang up.

146
Just please talk to me.

147
Well...

148
I only had one thing to do today.

149
I guess I could push it back.

150
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

151
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

152
...meaningless, dead-end job...

153
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

154
Chandler?

155
I'm sorry?

156
Oh. Look...

157
...I'm sure that people know you exist.

158
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle
surrounded by people.

159
I've been talking to you
for five minutes now about killing myself...

160
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

161
Hey, everybody, uh...

162
...I'm gonna kill myself.

163
I got nothing.

164
Good chair.

165
Now, if anybody asks...

166
...your name is Rosita.

167
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

168
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

169
Maybe we should actually
move Rosita out of here, you know?

170
Start the healing process.

171
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- Okay.

172
She's healed.

173
- That's weird.
- No, it's not weird.

174
It's a miracle.

175
It's not a miracle, Joey.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

176
There is. If you want something enough
and your heart is pure...

177
...wondrous things can happen.

178
Well, she'll understand, right?
It's not like I did it on purpose.

179
Dad, that won't matter to her.

180
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.
And all her stuff is...

181
...growing new stuff.

182
See, this is exactly the kind of thing...

183
...that makes her think
you guys love me more than you love her.

184
Oh, my God. Does she really think that?

185
Well, can you blame her?

186
I don't know. I suppose
we may have favored you unconsciously.

187
You were a medical marvel.

188
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear about it.

189
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

190
Okay, look.
Monica came here for some memories.

191
Damn it, we're gonna give her some.

192
Okay, grab...

193
Grab some empty boxes, okay?
We'll take stuff from mine...

194
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put them in there.

195
- Right.
- Like, this. She could have made this.

196
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

197
You know, if you want to tell
the medical marvel story while we work...

198
...that'd be fine.

199
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

200
Yeah. Me too.

201
Wow, you know, that this thing
has speakers in the headrest?

202
- No, really?
- Yeah.

203
You can hook it up to your TV
and you get radio.

204
My chair heals itself.

205
All right. Earl, let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

206
There's gotta be someone else in your life
that's worth sticking around for.

207
What about your family or friends?
Or maybe a girlfriend?

208
Heh. Yeah, right.

209
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

210
Okay, I should...

211
I should probably be getting back
to my thing now.

212
- See you.
- No.

213
I'm not finished yet.
Don't you dare hang up on me!

214
The new girl's good.

215
So which boxes are mine?

216
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

217
- Oh, a coloring book.
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, you loved that thing.

218
You always had it with you.
You never went anywhere without...

219
Without that coloring book.

220
Really?

221
Wow. Looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines.

222
Uh-uh.

223
Wow, look at this.

224
I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.

225
Oh, this is yours.

226
I don't know how that got in there.

227
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

228
Ross, these are your boxes.

229
Where are my boxes?

230
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and it ruined everything in your boxes.

231
I'm sorry.

232
- Just mine?
- I'm afraid so.

233
So why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

234
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

235
So wait. Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

236
...because you wanted to keep the
bottom two inches of your car from water?

237
Well, there was also leaves
and gook and stuff.

238
I can't believe this.

239
Screw it. I'm having one.

240
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

241
How would you like to sit
in a chair that fully reclines...

242
...has a rolling massage...

243
...and speakers in the headrest?

244
Yeah, I'd love to,
but I've tried that so many times...

245
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

246
Well, what if I told you
that you could do it in my apartment?

247
Are you telling me...

248
...that you bought the chair that is making
all other lounge systems obsolete?

249
The chair that Sit Magazine
called "Chair of the Year"?

250
I just purchased...

251
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

252
Well, that's awesome. That's great.
What made you do it?

253
Well, it's a long story,
but I broke Joey's chair...

254
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

255
- Yeah.
- I thought I broke Joey's chair.

256
- That's why I replaced it with mine.
- Oh.

257
That's how it got fixed.

258
Well, what did you think?
That elves came in and fixed it?

259
No.

260
Angels.

261
- I'm getting my chair back.
- Hey.

262
Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.

263
So I guess this chair's mine now.

264
Joey, you broke my chair!

265
Your chair?

266
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair,
so he switched the chairs.

267
- So there was no miracle?
- No, Joe. No miracle.

268
Oh, no. This is devastating.

269
My faith is shaken.

270
I'm so glad I have the new chair to get me
through this difficult time in my life.

271
Excuse me, could you tell me
where can I find Earl?

272
He's the supply manager here.

273
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.

274
I'm right here!

275
Earl?

276
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

277
The lady who sells toner?

278
Um, look, you can't kill yourself.

279
Look, um, I really appreciate
you coming down...

280
No, no, I can't let you do it.

281
Why?

282
Because it was fate
that made me call you today.

283
I thought it was toner.

284
No. Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job, okay?

285
And my first day on the job,
you're my first call.

286
And somebody else might have hung up
on you, but I wouldn't do that...

287
...because I know about this stuff.

288
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

289
- Yes.
- How?

290
I'm not gonna give you tips.

291
Look, don't you see that this...?

292
This all came together
so that I could stop you from doing this.

293
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

294
It doesn't really seem like enough
to be fate.

295
Oh, well. Um, okay, here's a weird thing.

296
My mother was also a supply manager.

297
I'm actually the office manager.

298
Oh, my God. So was she!

299
And get this, okay.

300
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

301
Pearl.

302
Was there anything else?

303
Sure.

304
Um, where are you from?

305
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

306
Oh, I've got goose bumps.

307
Really?

308
- Well, I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.
- Yeah.

309
But... Look. Okay.
These jerks might not care about you...

310
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

311
Did you hear that?

312
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

313
...because the universe cares.

314
The whole universe!

315
I really wish they'd care just a little bit.

316
Oh, this is terrible.

317
Everything is destroyed.

318
Look at this.

319
It obviously meant enough for me
to save it, and now I can't tell what it is.

320
It's still soft.

321
What do you think this is?

322
Mon, I think it was a mouse.

323
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

324
You've wrecked all
my childhood memories...

325
...you love Ross more than me.

326
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

327
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

328
Now, I'm sorry about everything
that happened...

329
...and I'll probably never be able
to make it up to you...

330
...but here's a start.

331
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

332
Well, the key to your Porsche.

333
- What?
- What?

334
I've been thinking of getting rid of it...

335
...and I was driving it the other day
and I saw my reflection in a window.

336
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

337
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding me, right?

338
Well, wait a minute.

339
I mean, a couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

340
- Why don't we take it for a spin?
- All right.

341
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

342
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

343
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

344
Know what happened
to Chandler's Barcalounger?

345
Oh, yeah. Joey broke it.
Had to get rid of it.

346
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

347
Heh. This is the best day ever!

﻿1
Happy birthday!

2
Happy birthday!

3
- Rach, come on.
- Come on.

4
It's your birthday.

5
Hey.

6
She's not as pretty as she was
when she was 29.

7
Ms. Green wants to establish
some ground rules before she comes out.

8
She would appreciate it if you didn't
use the words "old" or "downhill"...

9
...or "They still look pretty damn good."

10
They do.

11
Rachel, come on out.

12
Monica made breakfast.

13
Chocolate chip pancakes.

14
We've got presents.

15
Good ones?

16
They all came from the list
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
Well, can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

18
Come on, Rach, look,
turning 30 is not that big a deal.

19
Oh, really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

20
Why, God, why?

21
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me.

22
Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

23
No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th
birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.

24
And now Chandler.

25
We're all getting so old.

26
Why are you doing this to us?

27
Rach, you're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

28
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

29
Your character is in a coma.

30
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

31
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

32
...who've accomplished so many
of their goals by the time they're 30.

33
Yeah, but you shouldn't
compare yourself to me.

34
- Come on, Phoebe.
- You can do it.

35
Come on. There you go.

36
I did it.
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

37
That's it. That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

38
Oh, except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

39
Oh, well. But, yay!

40
And, girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean. Heh.

41
Come on, let's have some fun, huh?
What do you want to do today?

42
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

43
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

44
Hey, that was a practical purchase.

45
I needed that car for transportation.

46
Okay? I have a child.

47
How hot do I look in this, huh?

48
Ross, a sports car?

49
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

50
That's not what this is about, okay?

51
I am a sports car enthusiast.

52
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower on this thing?

53
I don't know, but look how shiny.

54
- I can't believe you bought this.
- So can I have a ride, stud?

55
Hop in.

56
Get ready for the smoothest ride
of your life.

57
Damn it.

58
Okay, who's next?

59
You know what?
I am gonna do something today.

60
I'm not just gonna sit around
like some old lady.

61
I want to get something pierced.

62
Like my, uh, nose
or my tongue or something.

63
Really? Because, you know, that hurts.

64
So what? You know, the way I see it...

65
Ow! Son of a bitch.

66
Look, Rachel,
I know what you're going through.

67
I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.

68
Get out of my apartment.

69
Rach, for what it's worth,
I think that you're doing great.

70
I mean, let's face it,
no one handles this well.

71
Heh. Least of all you.

72
Would you put that back on.
Monica's gonna be here any minute.

73
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

74
Okay, for the last time,
it's not named after each individual man.

75
You've done a wonderful job
with this party, Chandler.

76
- Everything looks so lovely.
- Oh, well, not as lovely as you.

77
I mean, I can't believe
you would have a 30-year-old daughter.

78
And you, I can't believe
you would have a tux that's 30 years old.

79
It's older than that. Ross was actually
conceived right near this tuxedo.

80
Oh.

81
Okay, everybody hide.
I saw her. She's coming.

82
Okay, okay. Everybody down.
Everybody down.

83
Okay, everybody stay here.
I will find out what's going on.

84
Hey, you got the door open.

85
Hey, are you drunk?

86
No.

87
Okay.

88
Whoa.

89
Okay.

90
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

91
...30.

92
So the busboys
took me out for some drinks.

93
Might want to puke on you later.

94
Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

95
All your friends are in there
and your parents.

96
- No.
- Yes.

97
Oh, no. My parents have never
seen me drunk.

98
That they know of.

99
Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee
and they will never know that you're drunk.

100
- Really, you promise?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

101
I love you so much.

102
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

103
What about your breath?

104
That's still yours.

105
Okay, now, remember,
it's a surprise party.

106
So when you go in, act surprised.

107
- Okay.
- Okay. Shh.

108
Ready?

109
Surprise!

110
Okay, forward. Forward.

111
Stop!

112
Okay, back... Stop!

113
Okay, for... Stop! Stop! Stop!

114
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

115
I'm gonna break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

116
You guys push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

117
Okay? All right. Here we go.

118
Haul ass!

119
Happy 30th birthday. Here.

120
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

121
Happy 30th.

122
Why do you keep saying that?

123
Because it's our 30th birthday.

124
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

125
Wait.

126
Oh, it's you.

127
Yeah. What?

128
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

129
Nuh-uh.

130
Yuh-huh. That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

131
You have your birth certificate?

132
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

133
Our mom.

134
Right. Okay.

135
- Do you have my birth certificate?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

136
Oh, my God.

137
Oh, my God, we are 31.

138
Yeah.

139
I just lost a whole year of my life.

140
Okay.

141
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

142
Oh, I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

143
Yes. Phoebe.

144
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

145
Look at that. We made it all the way
across the room. You're doing great.

146
- What's going on?
- Monica's a little drunk.

147
Yay, I love drunk Monica.

148
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

149
She doesn't want her parents
to know she's drunk.

150
Oh, all right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

151
I'll get twice as drunk as Monica
and then no one's even gonna notice her.

152
What's going on?

153
Monica's wasted.

154
Maybe that'll liven up this party.

155
Okay, will you just go help her
get changed, please?

156
Okay, but taking care of a drunk,
naked woman seems like a job for Joey.

157
Yep.

158
- This one's from me.
- Ah.

159
It wasn't on your list,
but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.

160
A scooter.

161
Stick to the list.

162
Always stick to the list.

163
No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.

164
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.

165
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two presents from you?

166
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

167
- Okay, read the card, read the card.
- Okay.

168
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

169
It's better to be over the hill...

170
...than buried under it.

171
All our love,
Monica and Chandler." That's funny.

172
No, no, no, no. That was a joke.

173
I know, I get it. It's funny.

174
No, because you're not a grandmother.

175
I know, because to be a grandmother,
you have to be married and have children.

176
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

177
I'm just gonna go...

178
All you had to do was buy the card.

179
Okay, you know what?

180
It was stupid to get upset
about not having a husband and kids.

181
All I really needed was a plan.

182
See, I wanna have three kids.

183
Let me guess. And you want to have them
all at the same time...

184
...and you want to have them
for your brother. Ha, ha.

185
As I was saying...

186
I should probably have the first
of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?

187
Which gives me five years.

188
So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35,
I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

189
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

190
Oh, wait, but I do want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

191
Really? That long?

192
Look all you want, it's happening.

193
So I don't have to get married
until I'm 33.

194
That's three years.
That's three whole years.

195
Oh, wait a minute though.

196
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

197
And I'd like to know the guy
for like a year, year and a half...

198
...before we get engaged.

199
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

200
Which is fine,
because you just turned...

201
...28.

202
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

203
According to my plan, I should already
be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.

204
Will you quit hogging it?

205
Oh, I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

206
You're drunk.

207
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

208
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

209
Hey. Are those crab cakes?

210
Did I not tell you to come straight to me
when more crab cakes were ready?

211
How you feeling?

212
You are so handsome.

213
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

214
I really wish that you wouldn't.

215
All you have to do is just get through
a little bit more, okay?

216
Then we can put you in bed, okay?
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.

217
Speech, speech.
Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?

218
Pheebs.

219
Don't you see,
everybody's looking at me.

220
The plan's working.

221
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.

222
Speech. Come on, speech.

223
Come on. Speech.

224
Hey, Chandler, you can't keep
your hands off her for one second.

225
Oh, I think it's nice.

226
I think it's necessary.

227
I wanna thank you all for coming.

228
My family and my friends.

229
Whoo-hoo.

230
I'd really like to say that I'm, um...

231
You know what I'd really like to say?

232
I'm drunk.

233
That's right, Mom and Dad.

234
Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.

235
And guess what? I've been drunk before.

236
And I've smoked a cigarette.

237
But you know what? You know what?

238
It's all okay.
It's okay, because I turned 30 today.

239
And I can do anything I want.

240
Because I am a grownup.

241
- Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
- Yeah.

242
I lost a whole year.

243
I can't believe it. This is so unfair.

244
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

245
Will it? Will it?

246
How would you feel if you found out
you were 31?

247
That's not gonna happen, you know,
because we have a new deal.

248
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.

249
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31.

250
- Like what?
- Like, okay...

251
...I haven't met any Portuguese people.

252
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

253
And I haven't been to sniper school.

254
Phoebe, why don't we go upstairs
and have some birthday cake?

255
No, I just feel like being by myself for a
while, all right? I'll see you guys later.

256
Thanks.

257
Oh, poor Pheebs.

258
Hey, you know what, you guys?
I think I'm gonna go walk her home.

259
- Oh, man.
- What?

260
He's gonna eat the cake.

261
Pheebs. Wait up.

262
Listen, I...

263
Close your eyes.

264
Maybe that's one
you can cross off your list.

265
Oh, yeah. Heh.

266
Oh, and plus,
I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

267
Okay, is everybody clear?
We're gonna pick it up...

268
...and move it.

269
All we need is teamwork, okay?
We're gonna lift the car...

270
...and slide it out.

271
Lift...

272
...and slide.

273
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

274
...and slide.

275
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

276
Lift...

277
...and slide.

278
- Hey, Joey...
- Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.

279
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

280
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

281
- Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother.
- Okay.

282
- Not in the street!
- Yeah.

283
- Hey.
- Hey.

284
- How you doing, you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...

285
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

286
- Um...
- What's up?

287
Uh, Tag, um...

288
You're such a great guy,
and we have so much fun together.

289
- But I...
- Wait.

290
I think I see where you're going.

291
But before you say anything else,
can I just say one more thing?

292
Well said.

293
And a, uh, good example of the fun
I was referring to.

294
Uh, but, heh, I think I'm past the point
where I can, you know, just have fun.

295
Rachel, don't do this.
This is just because you're turning 30.

296
Yeah, it is.

297
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

298
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

299
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

300
Well, actually, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actually wish I was six years younger.

301
- Me too.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

302
Hey, how'd it go?

303
Oh.

304
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

305
You did the right thing.

306
I don't like this anymore.

307
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

308
Wow, do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

309
Why, God?
Why are you doing this to us?

310
Yes. My baby's finally free.

311
All right.

312
Start it up. Let's go.

313
Whoo-hoo!

314
How hot are we?

315
You wanna buy a car?

﻿1
So thanks for coming by, guys.

2
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
Oh.

4
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just...

5
Monica said "wedding."

6
Uh, so we wanted to know if one of you
would like to read something.

7
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

8
Too?

9
Yeah, I kind of, ahem, have something else
planned for you guys.

10
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

11
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the QT.

12
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

13
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
So I talked to one of the DOOL writers...

15
- What is DOOL?
- Days Of Our Lives.

16
You're not gonna believe it.
My character is coming out of his coma!

17
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

18
And not only that.
I'm getting a new brain!

19
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

20
What do you mean
you're getting a new brain?

21
They're killing off one of the characters,
and when she dies...

22
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

23
Heh, what? A brain transplant?

24
It's ridiculous.

25
I think it's ridiculous that you haven't
had sex in three and a half months.

26
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

27
Who are they killing off?

28
Uh, Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

29
- No!
- No!

30
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

31
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.

32
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to do that?

33
Don't do it.

34
And she's been on the show forever.

35
- It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
- Yeah.

36
Help me out here. When you...

37
When you come out
of the "brain transplant"...

38
...you are going to be her?

39
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

40
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

41
Rach, so that guy there:

42
Straight or gay?

43
Oh.

44
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight. Ha, ha.

45
Ooh, Knockers will help us
figure it out.

46
All right, straight.

47
And not subtle.

48
- He left his cell phone.
- Oh?

49
We could hand it to Gunther,
he'll put it in lost and found.

50
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

51
What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone
to find out who found it, and I answer...

52
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

53
Wouldn't that be a great story?

54
- Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
- Yeah.

55
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.

56
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

57
I don't know. I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

58
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

59
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

60
Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.

61
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

62
Yeah, and until now,
I didn't think I would love again.

63
- Nice try.
- Hey, wait.

64
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

65
I don't know.

66
Well, um...

67
Maybe we could, uh...

68
Ah-ha! Too slow! Ha-ha-ha.

69
Ah-ha! Too cocky.

70
I'm going to date him.
There's nothing you can do.

71
Yes, there is.

72
What, are you going to kill him
like you did Charles?

73
Oh, my baby.

74
Cut!

75
That was a great scene. And that slap
looked so real. How do you do that?

76
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?

77
Anyway, I just wanted to say
how wonderful I think you are.

78
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

79
No, uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

80
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

81
I wanted to say, since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

82
...I was wondering if there was any tips...
- I'm leaving the show?

83
I don't know, why?
Did you hear something?

84
- Who told you that?
- Oh, uh...

85
- One of the writers.
- Which? Was it bald or was it tall?

86
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

87
Okay. Whoo, eh.

88
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

89
...about a character I've been playing
for 20 years!

90
Miss Monroe... Oh, there you go.

91
Okay, look, I have an idea.

92
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial?

93
And then from that, we can tell
who has more in common with him...

94
...and whoever does gets the phone.

95
- Fine. All right.
- All right.

96
- First name on the speed dial is "Mom."
- Oh.

97
I lost my mom to suicide.

98
Okay, no way.

99
You can't use that to get the cute guy
and the last muffin.

100
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.

101
"Ben, Carlos, David..."

102
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
on his speed dial.

103
So? You don't know
that it's Barney's the store.

104
That could be his friend's house,
or a bar, or...

105
Who has Barney's the store
on their speed dial?

106
His new girlfriend.

107
What is that?

108
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

109
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

110
- Oh, my God.
- What?

111
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

112
He was hanging out with me yesterday
and he said, "You're half Scottish, right?"

113
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

114
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

115
Why is your family Ross?

116
He cannot play at our wedding.
Everyone will leave.

117
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

118
It's not even a song.

119
Wait. If you listen very carefully, I think...

120
...it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.

121
You're absolutely right.
They are writing me out of the show.

122
They don't know exactly when it's going
to happen, but apparently it's soon...

123
...and then that's it.

124
I'm sorry. If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

125
- Yeah, thanks.
- No, I mean it.

126
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

127
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

128
Oh, you're right.

129
Thank you.

130
- What's your name again?
- Uh...

131
- Joey.
- Joey. Well, thank you.

132
That is so sweet. Oh.

133
The... The only reason
I came up to you before...

134
...was because, well...

135
...because I'm really nervous
about being you.

136
You know, if you could help me capture
the essence of the character.

137
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?

138
All right, Joey, I will help you.

139
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

140
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

141
- Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

142
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

143
Jessica Lockhart
will never step foot in this place again!

144
Ever!

145
Oh, but, Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

146
I can do an English accent?

147
That baby's going on my resume.

148
- Hi, Pheebs. How are you?
- Good.

149
Um, Phoebe, remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

150
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

151
- Yeah.
- And I was gonna keep it in my purse...

152
...so if it rang, I could just pick it up?
- Yeah.

153
And then do you remember going
into my purse and stealing the phone?

154
Ooh, now you lost me.

155
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

156
No? So you're saying that if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

157
- No.
- Hmm. Okay.

158
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

159
Mm.

160
Oh, it does work.

161
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

162
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
Is Rachel there?

163
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

164
- That is damning evidence.
- Ugh.

165
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

166
My digital fairy tale's about to begin.

167
It's ri...

168
Would you stop doing that?

169
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

170
- Phoebe, you can't do th...
- Shh, I'm on a call.

171
Well, yeah, I mean, you could
pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?

172
At my apartment. It's, um...

173
It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.

174
And then maybe, you know, after,
we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.

175
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

176
You do know that I will be here
when he comes over.

177
Oh, and how will you know what time
to come over?

178
You just said it.

179
Oh.

180
Joey, the essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

181
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

182
...she owns everything...

183
...and every person in that room.

184
- You try it.
- Okay.

185
Right. Well, he's not mad at the room.

186
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

187
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

188
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

189
Oh, I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

190
It's been 20 years of my life.

191
Hey, hey. Maybe... Maybe, uh...
Maybe this is a good thing.

192
You know? It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

193
You're so talented.

194
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

195
...but, you know,
I just got so comfy here and...

196
Ugh, I turned down some amazing work.

197
- Like what?
- Well...

198
...let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...

199
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

200
Wow.

201
But, well, now...
Now's a different time for me.

202
Oh, hey, come on. Don't, uh...
Don't do this.

203
Let me tell you something, okay?

204
When I watch you do a scene,
I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."

205
But... But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

206
You think I'm hot?

207
You own the room.

208
We... We should probably get the...

209
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

210
So when Jessica kisses a man...

211
...she usually puts, um...

212
...both her hands on the man's face.

213
Yeah, I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

214
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

215
You want to try it?

216
Yeah, okay.

217
That was good. That was really good.

218
But I think that maybe
your hands are just a little off.

219
- They should be, maybe... Like, right...
- Mm.

220
Well, I feel like a snack.

221
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

222
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

223
What?

224
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

225
...Vikings.

226
It sounds to me like your family's ready
to, uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.

227
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

228
How did you know about that?

229
We heard you play
all the way from your apartment.

230
Were you the ones who called the cops?

231
That's not really important right now.
Ahem.

232
What is important is,
while we appreciate the gesture...

233
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

234
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

235
Just give me a chance to perform for you,
and then decide whatever you want.

236
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play, either. But, uh...

237
...let's just say when it's over...

238
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit o' celebration.

239
Hey, hey!

240
Who is it?

241
Hi, It's Tom.

242
- I'm here to pick up the phone.
- Ah!

243
Whoa, why do you
get to answer the door?

244
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

245
Well, then I get to give him the phone.

246
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

247
Hi.

248
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

249
Um, ha, ha.

250
You're not the man
who left the cell phone.

251
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

252
Um, no.

253
Could you, uh, give us one second?

254
- Sure.
- We'll be right back, sir.

255
- Well, what do we do?
- I don't know.

256
Can you believe this?

257
We were waiting for a hot guy
and an even hotter one shows up.

258
I know...

259
What?

260
Rachel, listen...

261
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

262
All right.

263
All right, Phoebe, I will let you have him.

264
But you owe me. You owe me big.

265
So which one of you lovely ladies
am I gonna take to dinner, huh?

266
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

267
- After you.
- Okay, thank you.

268
Nice.

269
Well, you certainly own that room.

270
Actually, I rent the whole place.

271
And I just got what you meant.
Thank you.

272
- Hi.
- Hey.

273
Oh, my God.

274
Aah! Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

275
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

276
Well, it's nice to know that...

277
Monica! Monica!

278
That, uh... That's my roommate, Rachel.

279
Oh, that explains
all the women's underwear.

280
Sure. Yeah.

281
Oh, my God, it's true!

282
Oh, my God.

283
Can I just ask you to do me...
Aw... Just one favor?

284
Certainly.

285
Would you slap me?
Would you slap me right here in the face?

286
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

287
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

288
No, wait. Just one moment. Um...

289
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

290
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by. See you.

291
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

292
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

293
- Oh, my God.
- What?

294
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

295
- They don't?
- Well, no, I'm in a coma.

296
This must mean I have lines.

297
Oh.

298
How does it happen?

299
Ooh.

300
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

301
A what? Jessica hates horses.

302
I'm guessing after this she's not
gonna be crazy about electricity, either.

303
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

304
And the electric fence, inspired.

305
Thank you, sweetheart.

306
I can't believe she's really gone.

307
Look around you. All of this is ours.

308
I don't think so.

309
Who are you?

310
What's the matter, Dina?

311
Don't you recognize your own...

312
...mother?

313
Cut! That was great,
everybody. Thank you.

314
That was so wonderful!

315
Oh, I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

316
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were very good.

317
Heh, thanks.

318
Guess what? Good news.
I got another job.

319
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

320
A film in Guadalajara.

321
The airport?

322
No, that's LaGuardia.

323
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

324
Well, how long will you be gone?

325
Eight months.

326
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit me.

327
I bet that you could, uh,
own a few places down there.

328
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

329
And I just got what you meant.
That is a...

330
- I'll tell you, that's a tricky one.
- It's a tricky one.

331
Well...

332
Good luck.

333
You too.

334
Ahem. Okay, now, uh,
remember, I'm still learning.

335
One, two, three, four!

336
You know the song. Sing along.

337
So?

338
- No!
- No!

﻿1
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

3
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
- Okay, uh, before we do...

4
...uh, are any of Joey's special
romance magazines in there?

5
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

6
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
That's Rachel.

8
- But whatever.
- Mm-hm.

9
Could you do me a big favor?

10
The, uh, dean's office called
and said there was an urgent meeting.

11
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

12
- Well, what about Monica?
- Uh, she isn't home.

13
So it would just be me alone?

14
- Well, Ben would be there.
- No...

15
Huh. Um...

16
- What's the matter?
- Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...

17
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

18
He's not an ex-con.

19
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

20
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

21
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

22
- Okay.
- Okay, Ben, come here.

23
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

24
Gonna be okay?

25
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

26
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

27
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

28
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

29
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

30
Can you blame him?

31
I don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...

32
...while he's thinking, "I'd do it too."

33
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

34
We need someone
to perform our wedding...

35
...and they're all either
boring or annoying...

36
...or keep staring at the ladies.

37
Ooh, you should have one of us do it.

38
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

39
No, it's a real thing.

40
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

41
I call it!

42
What? It was my idea!

43
Thank you very much,
but neither of you is marrying us.

44
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

45
We're having a legitimate clergy member.

46
And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...

47
...and in control of his saliva.

48
Ben, you know, when, uh...
When you were a baby...

49
...we'd hang out all the time.

50
Because I was your daddy's girlfriend.

51
But you're not anymore.

52
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

53
Hey, we were not on a... Okay.

54
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

55
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

56
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

57
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would, um...

58
We'd repeat everything the other said...

59
...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

60
...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

61
That's a good one.

62
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

63
I'm funny?

64
Oh, thank God.

65
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

66
Um, you, uh... You take a quarter...

67
You take a quarter...

68
...and you blacken the edge, right?

69
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

70
...to your chin without it leaving your face."

71
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

72
Can I do it to you?

73
Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

74
Heh, okay?

75
So did you, uh,
find anyone to marry you guys yet?

76
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...

77
...wondering if we're still together.

78
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

79
- Joe...
- No, I've been thinking.

80
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

81
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

82
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

83
- That is true.
- And the most important thing...

84
...is it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

85
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

86
Plus, I love you guys
and it would really mean a lot to me.

87
Might be kind of cool.

88
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

89
All right! Okay!

90
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

91
Wait a minute.

92
- Internet ministers can still have sex?
- Yeah.

93
Coming.

94
I have a bone to pick with you.

95
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

96
Ben learned a little trick.

97
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right, that's right.

98
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

99
...so the pee goes everywhere.

100
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

101
You know I hate practical jokes.

102
They're mean, they're stupid
and I don't want my son learning them.

103
Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

104
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

105
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

106
Yes.

107
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

108
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

109
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

110
Our minister.

111
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

112
- Yeah.
- Listen, this is just the first draft, so...

113
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

114
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

115
Huh? Right.

116
It is a love based on giving and receiving...

117
...as well as having and sharing.

118
And the love that they give and have
is shared and received.

119
And through this having and giving...

120
...and sharing and receiving...

121
...we too can share and love and have...

122
...and receive."

123
Should we call the spitter?

124
- Ha! Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

125
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

126
I was just in the neighborhood...

127
...and I passed by your building
and thought, "What's up with Carol...

128
...and sweet little Ben?"

129
- That's nice. Well, uh, come on in.
- Okay.

130
Um, I'll make some coffee
and, uh, we can chat.

131
I'd love that. I would love that.

132
So, uh... So where is sweet little Ben?

133
I would love to have a little...

134
I found him!

135
Very funny. Come here.

136
That is exactly why I've come here
to talk to you, okay?

137
- Rach, you want some sugar?
- Yes, but...

138
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

139
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

140
Okay. Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

141
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

142
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that."

143
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks."

144
- Oh, damn it.
- "Oh, damn it!"

145
No! Don't say that.

146
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

147
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap.

148
- "Oh, crap!"
- Oh.

149
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

150
Yeah, okay.

151
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

152
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

153
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

154
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

155
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

156
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

157
...is that it can be about us.

158
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

159
Ooh, ooh.

160
Uh, okay. Maybe I'll talk about London.
You know, when you two hooked up.

161
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

162
...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...

163
- There you go.
...by doing it."

164
- Joe.
- Okay, all right, um...

165
So, uh... So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

166
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

167
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

168
I call that "London style."

169
That didn't happen with us.

170
Ooh, but maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

171
Yeah.

172
Okay, uh...

173
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

174
Ah.

175
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me...

176
...and we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

177
I was a gentleman and I walked her
to her hotel room and said good night.

178
Oh.

179
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

180
Hey.

181
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

182
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

183
...9:15.

184
Is Joey here?

185
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

186
So, uh, you're not still upset
about what that guy told you, are you?

187
Wouldn't you be?

188
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

189
You have to let that go, okay?

190
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

191
Really?

192
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

193
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
We just made out.

194
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

195
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

196
How drunk are you?

197
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you should feel guilty.

198
That's the perfect amount.

199
- You know what's weird?
- What?

200
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

201
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

202
- Want to get under the covers?
- Mm-hm.

203
Okay.

204
Wow, you are really fast!

205
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

206
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

207
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

208
One, two, three.

209
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

210
- Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
- Eh.

211
Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.

212
Hey.

213
Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...

214
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

215
No!

216
It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.

217
Where are the condoms?

218
In my bag over there.

219
Ah.

220
Uh...

221
...could you leave me one?

222
For just you?

223
Yeah.

224
All right. There you go, buddy.

225
Go nuts.

226
That's what that was?

227
Can you imagine
if I hadn't left you that last one?

228
You two might've never gotten together.

229
Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent
that hooker up, like I was gonna?

230
- It's like it was in the stars.
- Hmm.

231
Yeah, totally meant to be.

232
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

233
- What?
- What?

234
What?

235
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

236
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

237
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

238
I wanted something stupid
and meaningless. I just wanted sex.

239
So when I went to your room that night...

240
...I was actually looking for Joey.

241
Yeah, baby.

242
No, baby.

243
Oh, my God.

244
You came looking for Joey?

245
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

246
It's not important? It's not important?

247
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

248
No! Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

249
Hey!

250
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

251
There's no way you're doing
this wedding now, okay?

252
What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.

253
I was with my bridesmaid.

254
And who's to say I would've said yes?

255
I mean, I would've said yes.

256
Look, you are making way
too big a deal out of this.

257
Everything worked out okay.

258
It's just weird, okay?

259
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

260
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

261
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

262
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

263
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

264
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

265
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

266
Very good.

267
Rachel, what are you doing here?

268
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.

269
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

270
What's her last name?

271
Carol...

272
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

273
By the way, that, uh...
That line down my face...

274
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

275
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

276
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

277
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

278
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

279
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

280
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

281
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

282
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

283
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

284
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

285
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

286
- Hey.
- Hey.

287
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

288
Nothing even happened.

289
I just... I don't want you to be upset.

290
How can I not be upset?

291
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

292
...and it turns out she wanted you first.

293
Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.

294
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

295
We look at you and we see you together,
and it just...

296
It fits, you know?

297
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

298
That's what you should say.

299
What?

300
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

301
Really? I could do it?

302
I'd love you to do it.

303
Hey.

304
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

305
Well, I don't remember exactly...

306
...but it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

307
- Hey.
- Hey.

308
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

309
We talked and Monica made me see
that I overreacted a little bit.

310
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

311
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

312
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

313
Honey, dinner's ready!

314
What's my little chef got for me tonight?

315
- Your favorite.
- Ho, ho, ho.

316
Fried stuff with cheese.

317
Yep.

318
And lots of it!

319
Thanks, sweetheart.

320
Give me a little sugar. Okay.

321
You wanna go...?

322
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

323
How you doing?

324
- Hey.
- Hey!

325
I'm sorry to do this again,
but could you look after Ben for a bit?

326
I've got this meeting at school...

327
...and he asked for his "fun Aunt Rachel."

328
Well, of course I will watch him.

329
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

330
- Okay. See you later, pal.
- Okay.

331
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

332
- You got something on your back.
- What?

333
That's great. That is great.

334
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

335
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

336
That's it! Come here!

337
- You're in big trouble, young man!
- No, wait.

338
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

339
You guys, hold it. Seriously...

340
Oh, my God!

﻿1
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to six.

2
Food? Oh, give me.

3
So did Monica tell you we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
Since when are you into swing music?

5
Since forever. I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
- Chandler.
- Gap commercial.

7
- So did you book them? Did you call?
- I will.

8
- You want me to call?
- No. I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
- What is your job?
- Staying out of the way.

10
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15?

11
- There were only 12.
- Oh, yeah, I added three.

12
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?

13
Well, hello.

14
She's cute.

15
Should we go try to talk to her?

16
Sure. The great thing about being engaged,
I'm not nervous to talk to pretty girls anymore.

17
Could you guys help me?

18
Yeah, let me get that for you.

19
- It's really heavy.
- I got it.

20
Oh!

21
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend, Chandler.

22
I'm Kristen.

23
Kristen. Hi. Are you new to the area?

24
Because if you are,
I'd love to show you around sometime.

25
- I actually just moved from four blocks over.
- Oh.

26
But this block is like a whole other world.

27
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
This street is the first street in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
...would just flow
right down the street. Yeah.

31
Sometimes ankle-deep.

32
Smooth.

33
Excuse me?

34
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?

35
- I'd like that.
- Yeah? Great.

36
Let me take this up.

37
- After you.
- Oh, no. After you.

38
Oh, my God!

39
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

40
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

41
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

42
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
I can't believe I found it.

44
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.

46
I'm Megan Bailey.

47
- Have you found your dress yet?
- No. These dresses are all so amazing...

48
...but I couldn't afford one.
- No, I can't afford this either.

49
I'm here to figure out the one I want,
then I'll get it at Kleinman's, this discount place.

50
Day after tomorrow,
they're having a huge sale.

51
- Thanks for the tip.
- When are you getting married?

52
- I'm not. I just like to try these on.
- I do the same thing.

53
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25th.

54
I'm just kidding too. Ha, ha.

55
I'm getting married in December.

56
- When are you getting married?
- May 15th.

57
Ooh. It's close.
So who's your photographer?

58
- Jeffrey.
- We met with him.

59
- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
- Best Man? Wow!

60
I know. I almost called off
my wedding. Heh, heh, heh.

61
- Oh, who's your band?
- My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

62
You're lucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

63
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"?
Oh, my God, it doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
Oh, you know what? Don't buy that here.

65
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's. Get it half off.

66
This place is so over-priced.

67
I own this store.

68
So does this come
in another color, or...

69
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
- Moving in.
- Can I give you a hand?

71
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was helping
before had to leave because he hurt his back.

72
- Boyfriend?
- No.

73
I'm Joey.

74
Kristen.

75
Wow. What a beautiful name.

76
What is it again?

77
- Kristen.
- Ah, that's it. Okay.

78
- You live around here?
- Yeah. Yeah, right down there.

79
Let me give you a tip.

80
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up without shoes.

81
- I'll remember that.
- Okay.

82
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

85
You look strong. I'll take that,
you grab one of the boxes.

86
Okay. Yeah.

87
Yeah, I'll get this one.

88
What's taking so long?

89
WOMAN 2
Come on.

90
So this is Brooklyn?

91
All right, listen up. There's usually only
one dress in each size.

92
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

93
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

94
When you locate the dress
blow on these, all right?

95
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

96
Okay, got it.

97
Here he comes!

98
- Oh, they're pushing!
- Don't be a baby!

99
- Out of the way!
- Let's go!

100
Hey, Rachel! Come on!

101
No. No, not it. Not it. Not it. Ugh.

102
Don't crowd me.

103
This is it! This is the dress!
Oh, my God. It's perfect.

104
I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!

105
- Megan!
- Monica!

106
- You came!
- Yeah!

107
- This is my dress!
- No!

108
- Yes, it is. You saw me wearing it.
- And now you'll see me buying it.

109
You freak!

110
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

111
- Look, you don't want to fight me.
- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

112
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hey!

113
Okay! Hey.

114
Oh, what do I do?!

115
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

116
Did you find the dress?

117
No. You gotta get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

118
- We've gotta get Monica.
- You gotta hold my hand!

119
Oh, my God.

120
Excuse me! Excuse me!

121
Go! Go! Go!

122
- Hey.
- Go!

123
So, Ross,
how was your date the other night?

124
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?

125
Laugh all you want, but she left me a message
saying she'd like to go out again.

126
- Oh.
- In fact, I'll go call her right now.

127
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

128
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

129
Sorry I didn't stop by last night,
but I had a date.

130
Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by? That's okay.

131
Check it out. It was with this really hot girl
who just moved in right across the street.

132
- Really? Right across the street?
- Yeah.

133
- When did you meet her?
- Two days ago.

134
Excellent!

135
- You know, Ross met somebody too.
- Oh, yeah?

136
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

137
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

138
But I found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

139
Really?

140
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

141
Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

142
But I'm not too worried about it.

143
You shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

144
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

145
So this is nice.

146
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

147
But I have to.

148
By the way, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

149
- Kristen Leigh.
- Bye.

150
Well, obviously, only one of us
can keep dating her.

151
Obviously. So how do we decide?

152
Well now,
let's look at this objectively.

153
I think I should date her.

154
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

155
Or I'm the one who dates her.

156
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

157
Yeah, I like that. But just to go
in another direction...

158
Okay. This can go on for a while.

159
- We should order some food then.
- No, Joey.

160
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

161
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

162
And we'll see who she likes best.

163
That sounds fair.

164
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant down the street.

165
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit on the date.

166
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.

167
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

168
All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

169
- So let's decide on a spending limit.
- Yeah.

170
Uh...

171
And a slice...

172
Six dollars?

173
- I was thinking more like a hundred.
- Okay.

174
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

175
Uh.

176
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

177
You're out of Diet Coke.

178
Hello?

179
What? You what?

180
You listen here, missy!

181
What?

182
That was Megan. She booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...

183
...and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!

184
Does that mean Carcass is available?

185
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!

186
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

187
- Figure out a way to talk him out of it.
- How?

188
You're out of toilet paper!

189
- Hey.
- What's up?

190
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

191
- Thanks.
- What time are you meeting?

192
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

193
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

194
- I am dressed.
- Oh, well, good.

195
For me.

196
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

197
I have an oily T-zone.

198
Okay, dude.

199
- Hey, you sent Kristen flowers?
- That's right.

200
You spent 100 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

201
Actually, I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

202
...technically, I didn't break any rules.
Thanks for stopping by though.

203
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

204
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

205
- I'm not surprised.
- You won't get away with this.

206
- You don't have much choice.
- We'll see!

207
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

208
Hey! So just a light layer?

209
Yeah, just here and there.

210
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

211
Swing music is so out.

212
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

213
What are you guys talking about?

214
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

215
...and whether they're
the right way to go.

216
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...

217
...and two months later
the couple divorced.

218
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

219
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.

220
But I love swing music!

221
But The Swing Kings?

222
They suck so much that people actually die
at their concerts. They just stop living.

223
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.

224
And there's another reason.

225
- Well, what is the other reason?
- I don't want to say.

226
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.

227
It's just while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

228
...it was the first time
I knew that...

229
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

230
Oh, crap.

231
- Our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
- Oh, great.

232
- Is your back feeling better?
- Yeah, it's fine.

233
I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...

234
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

235
- Kristen?
- Joey!

236
- Hi.
- Hi.

237
- What are you doing here?
- I like this place.

238
And technically, technically,
I'm not breaking any rules, so...

239
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

240
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

241
I used to have a friend named Joey.

242
I don't anymore.

243
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

244
Sure! I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

245
So Joey, you look familiar.

246
Are you on TV or something?

247
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

248
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

249
That's right. That's right.
Don't you play a woman?

250
A woman in a man's body.

251
Much better.

252
So, Ross, it's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

253
Have you ever been married?

254
Yes, I have.

255
In fact, just the other day...

256
...Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.

257
- Yeah, little Eric.
- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

258
So you've just been married
the one time then?

259
- Well, um...
- You've been married twice?

260
Yes. And...

261
...another time after that.

262
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

263
Ahem. Hey, Joey, have you ever been
so hungry on a date...

264
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat some of her food?

265
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

266
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up? Hm?

267
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

268
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

269
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...

270
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

271
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

272
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

273
Hey, you leave Marcel out of this!

274
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?

275
Hey, hey! Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

276
Monkey-lover!

277
Where do you think we lost her?

278
Probably around "gonorrhea."

279
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- Don't come in here!

280
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

281
No. We only mess around at his place.

282
It's funny, I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here, please?

283
No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.

284
You got a wedding dress? That's great.

285
- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
- Then why can't I see it?

286
Oh. I guess you can.

287
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

288
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

289
Wow. You look hideous.

290
Really?

291
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

292
Why do you have to return it?

293
Because it doesn't really fit.

294
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.

295
Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.

296
But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.

297
- It makes me want to rip it right off you.
- Okay.

298
But you can't rip it.

299
- Well, maybe a little.
- Okay.

300
Hey, guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

301
Guys?

302
I thought you'd be gone all day.

303
All right, what's going on?

304
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

305
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
we'll have younger-looking skin.

306
- Yeah.
- Right there.

307
You know, she could use a little...

308
- Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

﻿1
Hey, hey! Guys, you won't believe this!

2
- I just got off the phone with my agent...
- Oh, my God!

3
- I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
- Okay.

4
I got nominated for my part
on Days of Our Lives!

5
- Oh, Joey, good for you!
- Congratulations!

6
- I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
- No, no.

7
- Soap Opera Digest Award?
- Nope, I'm up for a "Soapie."

8
Honey, is that something you're making up?

9
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been since 1998.

10
Hey, Rach, Rach. I'm up for a Soapie!

11
Oh, my God!

12
Oh, my God! That is the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

13
Thank you! Well, I guess now we know
who I'm taking to the awards.

14
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

15
Many are scheduled to appear.

16
Oh, my God.

17
- Oh, my God. I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- Okay, I'll go.

18
No! You are getting married.
This is all I have.

19
And Ernest Muhlbrat first hypothesized
that the velociraptor, when threatened...

20
...would expand its collar
and emit a high-pitched noise...

21
...to frighten off its predator.

22
Yes, Mr. Lewis?

23
What kind of noise?

24
Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.

25
But like how?

26
Well, we... We don't know for sure.

27
But in my head,
it sounded something like this, uh:

28
Of course, this is just conjecture.

29
Ahem, okay. That's, uh...
That's all for today.

30
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?

31
Yes, sir?

32
Mr. Morse, I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

33
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

34
Well, you need 60 percent to pass.

35
- What'd I get?
- Seven.

36
That's not so good.

37
No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?

38
Well, maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

39
I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.

40
I'm in love with you.

41
Well, that brings me in the loop a little.

42
See, that's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

43
When you're up there and you're teaching...

44
...and your face gets all serious...

45
...you look so good. When you wear
that tight little turtleneck sweater...

46
Okay. Ned, um...

47
I, uh... Ha, ha.
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

48
You're... You're a student.

49
And I... And I like women, ha, ha.

50
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of some of these chairs.

51
Oh, my God.

52
That guy at the counter
is totally checking you out.

53
Really?

54
- Oh, my God, he's really cute.
- Heh. Go for it.

55
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

56
I'm just saying, get his number,
just in case.

57
But if Chandler is in an accident
and can't perform sexually, you know...

58
...then he would want you to take a lover
to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.

59
- Hi. I...
- Oh.

60
Can I just tell you something? Um...

61
I'm very flattered,
but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.

62
Wow, uh... This is kind of embarrassing.

63
I was actually coming over
to talk to your friend.

64
Well, you should be embarrassed.

65
- I thought you knew I was looking at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

66
"The winner is Joey Tribbiani!"

67
"Oh, wow.

68
I honestly never expected this. I, uh...

69
I didn't prepare a speech.

70
But I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

71
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

72
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

73
Look at you with your
little maple syrup award!

74
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this.

75
What? No.

76
It's not a big deal.
I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.

77
- Really?
- Yeah.

78
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

79
- Best New Artist.
- Ooh.

80
Oh, hey, listen. The Soapies people called
today. I also get to present an award.

81
- Aw, that's great.
- Yeah.

82
So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.

83
- You... You don't think I'm gonna win?
- Of course I do.

84
Oh.

85
But, you know, Favorite Returning Character
is a tough category, Joey.

86
I mean, you're up against the guy
who survived his own cremation.

87
Yeah. No, I know I might not win.
But it's just...

88
I've never even been nominated before.
I want it so much.

89
Well, and you'll probably get it.

90
But you should probably start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

91
Like, when the cameras are on you
and you wanna look disappointed...

92
...but also that your colleague
deserved to win. Sort of like:

93
- Hey.
- You know?

94
- You practice losing at the Grammys too?
- Oh, no, at the Grammys, I always win.

95
Ah.

96
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. How'd your date go with Jake?

97
Great. We couldn't keep our eyes
off each other all night.

98
Then every once in a while, he'd lean over
and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.

99
Okay, stop it. You're getting me all tingly.

100
All I could think of was,
"Is he gonna kiss me? Is he?"

101
- And did he?
- I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.

102
But this hickey speaks for itself.

103
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.

104
I just like him so much that
I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today.

105
And I've only had six.

106
Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling
since I first starting going out with Chandler.

107
- Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

108
Heh. No, a guy would say, "I'm never gonna
get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.

109
Oh, my God.
I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!

110
I've been so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about all the things I'd be giving up.

111
I mean, I'm never gonna
have a first kiss again.

112
You'll have a last kiss.

113
Can I ask you something? You ever
had a guy have a crush on you?

114
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

115
There's this kid in my class
who said he's in love with me.

116
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

117
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend.

118
I do... I do not have a boyfriend.

119
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

120
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't know.

121
I mean, last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...

122
What... What... What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

123
...a sexy-professor vibe?

124
Not right now.

125
The point is, my natural charisma
has made him fail his midterm.

126
Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.

127
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard, you know.

128
I couldn't concentrate and
I blushed every time he looked at me.

129
Come on, you remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

130
- Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

131
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't.

132
I got under him.

133
Problem solved.

134
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

135
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

136
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

137
Phoebe, it's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

138
I've been thinking about it, and um...
You know what?

139
I'm okay about not having
that new-relationship feeling.

140
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

141
See, that's what I mean. That's great,
but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.

142
I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler
for the rest of my life.

143
- That's what makes me happy.
- Mm-hm.

144
Hey, sweetie, come here, sit down. We
were talking about how our relationship is...

145
...deep and meaningful.
It really is, don't you think?

146
Oh, totally.

147
Pull my finger.

148
Presenting the award
for Favorite Returning Male...

149
This is it. This is my category!

150
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

151
- Got your gracious-loser face?
- Yep.

152
Now, Joey, remember,
if you win, you have to hug me.

153
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?

154
- On TV?
- Yeah.

155
- Yeah.
- Okay.

156
In the category of Favorite Returning
Male Character, the nominees are:

157
John Wheeler from General Hospital.

158
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

159
Duncan Harrington from Passions.

160
And Joey Tribbiani
from Days of Our Lives.

161
And the Soapie goes to:

162
Gavin Graham from
The Young and the Restless.

163
Presenting
the Favorite Supporting Actress award:

164
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.

165
Any one of the brilliant actresses
nominated for this award tonight...

166
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

167
The nominees for
Favorite Supporting Actress are:

168
From Passions, Erin Goff.

169
From One Life to Live,
Mary Lauren Bishop.

170
From All My Children, Sarah Renee.

171
And from Days of Our Lives,
Jessica Ashley.

172
And the winner is:

173
Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.

174
Uh, unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

175
...so I'll be accepting this award
on her behalf.

176
And I'm sure that Jessica...

177
...would like to thank my parents...

178
...who always believed in me.

179
And she'd also like to thank my friends:

180
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

181
...who's sitting right there.

182
Joey, why did we have to
rush out of there so fast?

183
We had to get out of there because...

184
Look what I won! Ha-ha-ha.

185
Oh, my God. You stole her award.

186
No, no, no.
I'm accepting it on her behalf.

187
I don't think you know what "behalf" means.

188
Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!

189
Joey...

190
- You have got to take this back.
- Why? I should've won one. I really wanted it.

191
She didn't even care enough to come
to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.

192
No, Joey.

193
Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it.
There was a whole table full of them.

194
Do you really want an award
that you didn't win?

195
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

196
Plus, look, hey, Rach. If I put it up,
when people come over, they'll see it...

197
...and they'll think I won it.

198
Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."

199
I can scratch that right off.

200
Joey, no, this is wrong.
You have to take it back.

201
Okay? You don't wanna win an award
this way. You're very talented.

202
And someday you're gonna win one of these
for real and that one is gonna mean something.

203
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

204
- I'll take it back tomorrow.
- Thank you.

205
- If I can't have it, you can't have it!
- Aah!

206
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

207
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff...

208
...but I was kind of hoping
you could change my grade.

209
And why exactly would I do that?

210
Because I'm in love with you.

211
What?

212
Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.

213
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

214
Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.

215
Well, that's different, okay?
Because he was actually in love with me.

216
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

217
He's done this with three other teachers.

218
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

219
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

220
I know.

221
It's awful.

222
I love you.

223
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

224
I just keep thinking about
all these things I'm not gonna have...

225
...and it's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do about it.

226
Okay. Don't sweat it.

227
Chandler is nowhere around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

228
Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.

229
- I've just gotta talk to him about all this.
- That is the last thing you wanna do.

230
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

231
You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.

232
All right, I've never been engaged
and I've never really been married.

233
But I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

234
Whenever you have doubts or fears
or anxieties about a relationship...

235
...do not communicate them
to your husband.

236
So I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

237
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

238
That is correct. Yes.

239
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

240
...and then lock it up tight.

241
- Your mother told you this?
- Yes.

242
The woman that got married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

243
Oh, my God, you're right.

244
All right, go. Go tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

245
Wait, no! Does this also mean
that putting out doesn't get you love?

246
- I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

247
Please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

248
- Okay, I'm totally cool.
- Okay.

249
Come in.

250
Hey, Jessica.

251
Hey, Jess.

252
This is my friend Rachel.

253
- Hi.
- What's up?

254
Uh, listen, here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

255
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

256
That's it. You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

257
No, I try to save that for real awards.
Now if you'll excuse me?

258
Hm!

259
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

260
Yep.

261
Yeah, you do.

262
- Honey? As we get closer to the wedding...
- Hm?

263
...is there anything you'd like to
talk about or share?

264
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces
are too big.

265
You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.

266
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

267
Doesn't it ever freak you out that you're
never gonna be with anybody new again?

268
What?

269
Just...

270
I love you so much. Just...

271
It's just sometimes it bothers me
that I'm never gonna have that feeling.

272
When you first meet someone
for the first time...

273
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

274
No.

275
No, see, when I first meet somebody...

276
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

277
Okay, but... All right, you're a guy.

278
Does it not freak you out that you're
never gonna sleep with anybody else?

279
Sleeping with somebody, no.

280
Anxiety, panic and
I'm afraid even more sweating.

281
Even with me?

282
I was dangerously dehydrated during
the first six months of our relationship.

283
Look, for me the rush is knowing that we
are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.

284
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

285
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and, uh...

286
...I'm definitely gonna need
some kind of sports drink.

287
Come here.

288
Come here.
Oh, sweetie, you don't have to worry.

289
No. Besides, you know what?
I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.

290
The first time we buy a house,
our first kid, our first grandkid.

291
Water. Water. Water.

292
Uh, Mr. Morse?
Can I speak to you for a moment?

293
That was a great lecture today.

294
- Did you get a haircut?
- Mm-hm.

295
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

296
I want you to know that
I'm changing your grade back.

297
What? Why?

298
Because I know what you're trying
to pull here. It's not gonna work.

299
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

300
You know what, I'm not even gonna talk
about this. This little "thing" is over.

301
I know you have a girlfriend. Yeah.
And I know about the other professors.

302
How do you think that makes me feel, Ned?
You used me!

303
You don't love me and you never did!

304
Ah, Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

305
I'll be right with you.

306
Don't make this worse
and I'll give you a C. Shall we?

307
Rach?

308
- I'll be out in a second.
- Hm.

309
"It's just so unexpected! I...

310
Ha-ha-ha.

311
I'll tell you, it's just such an honor
to just be nominated...

312
...for a Nobel Prize.

313
And, you know, to win one
for a massage! Oh...

314
Especially after having just won
a Tony Award for Best Actress..."

315
We have to go.
Our reservations are at 8.

316
"...in Reservations at Eight
by Neil Simon.

317
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words."

318
You can finish this later.
We're gonna be late. We gotta go.

319
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.

320
Okay.

321
"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"

﻿1
- Oh, hey! How was your audition?
- Hey.

2
I'm sorry, do I know you?

3
What are you doing?

4
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

5
Oh, you got it?

6
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

7
A big-budget period movie about
three Italian brothers...

8
...who come to America at the turn
of the century. It's classy.

9
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

10
The "next-next"?

11
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

12
This guy's right after him.

13
Hello?

14
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

15
They loved me!

16
They want to see you again tomorrow.

17
- Oh, my God.
- Just one thing.

18
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

19
Are you kidding me?
I never rent a movie without it!

20
Oh.

21
Uh, okay, let me call you back.

22
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

23
- Wow.
- I know.

24
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

25
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

26
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

27
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

28
A "no sex" pact, huh?

29
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

30
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

31
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

32
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

33
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

34
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

35
You're probably right.

36
- Hi.
- Hey.

37
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

38
Yeah.

39
Subtle, guys.

40
What?

41
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

42
Ha, okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

43
- Okay. Sorry.
- Okay.

44
Oh, my God.
We have to throw her a shower?

45
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

46
I don't know.

47
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

48
Nudity's really important
to the story.

49
That's what you say about porn.

50
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

51
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

52
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

53
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

54
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

55
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

56
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

57
It's really sweet and tender.

58
Plus, everyone is gonna
see your thing.

59
When can we have this shower?

60
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

61
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

62
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

63
Well, if we make it yesterday,
woo-hoo, we're done.

64
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

65
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

66
There's too much to do.

67
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

68
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

69
Just calm down, woman!

70
Phoebe, I already did.

71
- All right, then I need to calm down.
- Okay.

72
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

73
- Uh-huh.
- We have two days to plan this party.

74
- We just need to make fast decisions.
- Mm-hm.

75
Where will we have it?

76
- Um, here. What time?
- Four o'clock. Food?

77
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Ooh, great. Very Monica.

78
- And chili.
- Ah, you went one too far.

79
- Uh, flowers or balloons?
- Both.

80
- We're paying for this. Okay.
- Neither.

81
- Um, what should we do for the theme?
- "Lusts of the Flesh."

82
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

83
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

85
Oh, boy. Me too.

86
You know, I was thinking,
if we had a big fight...

87
- Mm-hm.
...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.

88
- Yeah.
- Technically, we could have sex again.

89
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

90
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

91
- That's me. Come on.
- Okay.

92
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

93
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

94
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

95
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

96
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

97
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

98
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

99
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

100
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

101
Chandler, she's our cousin!

102
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

103
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

104
Say something.

105
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

106
Fine. She can stay at my place.

107
What does Cassie look like now?

108
- She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
- Huh.

109
So this Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

110
Wafer-thin ice.

111
Hey, I'm back.

112
Hi, Joey.

113
Uh, so, will I be reading
the same scene again?

114
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

115
Oh, great.

116
I'd have been perfect for this part.

117
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

118
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

119
And scene.

120
Huh? Wasn't that fun?

121
We did a little improv there. Yeah!

122
So, you... You were saying?

123
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

124
Wow. Sure. That's great.

125
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

126
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

127
And that barn is not too cold.

128
Terrific.
Well, uh, there's one more thing.

129
Uh... Uh, it's important to the director
that everything in the movie is authentic.

130
In your love scene with Sarah...

131
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

132
So...

133
So, what?

134
So, uh, well, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

135
...be authentically, uh, anatomically...

136
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

137
Yes!

138
No. What?

139
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

140
Bar mitzvah-ed?

141
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

142
- But you are?
- Yep.

143
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

144
Wow. Wow.

145
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

146
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

147
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

148
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

149
You figure out how to do it later.

150
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning to...

151
...grow a turtleneck.

152
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

153
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

154
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

155
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

156
Unless...

157
Unless what?

158
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

159
...fashion.

160
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet, but, um...

161
...off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

162
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

163
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

164
We get mahogany boxes and
carve everyone's names in them.

165
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

166
Okay. Okay.

167
- All right, you take care of that.
- Okay.

168
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

169
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

170
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

171
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

172
Have at it.

173
All right. Turkey?
Mm, that won't work.

174
Cheese? That won't work.

175
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

176
Are you making him a sandwich?

177
No, it's, um, more like a wrap.

178
Okay, so, um, I'm gonna go, guys.

179
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

180
We have to get her a present?

181
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

182
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

183
Ah.

184
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

185
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

186
Oh, nice.

187
Cassie?

188
- Hey, Ross.
- Hi. Ha, ha.

189
It's been so long!

190
Last time I saw you...

191
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

192
Oh, uh, that's right.

193
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

194
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

195
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

196
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

197
Oh.

198
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

199
Uh-huh.

200
Yeah, I have a knack for impressions.

201
Well, maybe after we get re-acquainted,
uh, you could do me.

202
Yeah. No!

203
Cassie, how you...?
How you doing on that...

204
...hot dog?

205
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

206
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

207
Oh, right, right.
Ooh, remember the time...

208
...l, uh, pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

209
We're probably too old to do that now.

210
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

211
Uh-huh, Uh-huh.

212
And... And I'll always remember
that summer...

213
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

214
It took you that long
to figure it out, huh?

215
Um, I'm a little slow.

216
Just as our children would be.

217
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

219
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you. So nice to see you.

220
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

221
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

222
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

223
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

224
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

225
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

226
How do you know Monica?

227
- I was her accountant four years ago.
- Oh...

228
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

229
That's great.

230
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

231
Excuse us.

232
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

233
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

234
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

235
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

236
Wow, those look great.

237
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
Uh, this one is made of bologna.

238
- And... And the toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

239
Thank God.

240
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

241
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

242
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

243
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

244
I also did a little something in fur,
but, uh, that's really just for me.

245
Why don't you try these on?
We'll get a better idea of what works.

246
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

247
Ow.

248
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

249
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

250
- And?
- Delicious.

251
Joey.

252
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

253
What? Which one?

254
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

255
She's your cousin. She's your cousin.

256
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

257
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

258
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

259
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

260
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logan's Run...

261
...the sexiest movie ever.

262
I know that look.

263
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

264
I'm going in.

265
What the hell are you doing?

266
Say something clever.

267
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

268
Just has to be words. Say some words.

269
Any words will do.

270
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

271
...that anyone has not talked ever!

272
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

273
...so just say something!

274
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

275
Yeah, you really
shouldn't have said anything.

276
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

277
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

278
Oh.

279
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

280
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

281
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

282
You already had it?

283
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

284
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

285
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

286
Now you don't have either.

287
- We ruined everything.
- Ugh.

288
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

289
- It kind of works out for the best, heh.
- What do you mean?

290
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

291
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

292
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

293
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

294
- Yeah.
- My whole family's from Naples.

295
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

296
We just need to, uh...

297
Leslie?

298
- Uh, Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Oh, hey, right. Not a problem.

299
I totally understand you need to...

300
...make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

301
Don't you worry.

302
I have nothing to hide.

303
So, there you go. That's me.

304
One hundred-percent natural.

305
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

306
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

307
Yeah. Thank you so much
for letting me stay here.

308
Oh, it's no problem. I've...

309
What?

310
Say something. Say anything.

311
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!

﻿1
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- Oh, I'll have some.

2
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

3
Ow.

4
- Oh, what's the matter, honey?
- My hand feels weird.

5
I guess it's because I'm engaged.

6
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

7
So let's actually get started
on the wedding plans.

8
- Okay.
- Already?

9
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We gotta think about the flowers...

10
...the caterers, the music...

11
- Oh, I got some thoughts on the music...
- Chandler, too many cooks...

12
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

13
Okay.

14
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

15
I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.

16
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations for instance:

17
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

18
...then by square footage.

19
That is so smart. Ha.

20
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.

21
And that should conclusively prove...

22
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

23
- Now, let's take a look...
- Hey, Ross.

24
Phoebe, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

25
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

26
Oh, my God. Um, of course.

27
Uh, would you please excuse me
for a moment?

28
Um, heh, do you know each other's
hometowns? Why don't you?

29
What's going on?

30
Well, um, not much. I was just thinking
that since those guys just got engaged...

31
...that maybe it'd be nice
if they had some privacy.

32
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

33
Um...

34
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

35
Nothing. Why?

36
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

37
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies
and it starts in like five minutes.

38
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

39
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

40
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents yet...

41
...but tell me how this is for music.

42
All right, um, a string quartet for the
processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...

43
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

44
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

45
Well, you couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...

46
Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

47
Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow,
you know, something a little snugglier?

48
Why are you napping over here
instead of over at your place?

49
- The duck.
- What, the duck?

50
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

51
Uh, well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

52
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

53
Now, do I get to look at this book...

54
...or is it just for people who are actually
involved in the wedding?

55
Of course you can look at it.
Yeah, I want your opinion too.

56
- Okay.
- Here you go.

57
- What do you think about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces.

58
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

59
Well, I just think they're a bit more
wedding-y, you know.

60
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

61
Uh-huh.

62
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

63
I'm gonna get cranky.

64
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

65
Yes, it is perfectly good...

66
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

67
What?

68
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

69
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

70
Hey, little buddy.

71
How you feeling? Aah.

72
What the hell is in that face cream?

73
That's so soft.

74
Pillowcases.

75
Oh, ah.

76
"Zelda looked at the chimney
sweep. Her father, the vicar..."

77
Vicar?

78
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

79
Her loins were burning.

80
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

81
Whoa.

82
This is a dirty book.

83
Uh, Phoebe?

84
Oh, Ross, hi.

85
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.

86
- Phoebe.
- Okay, let's talk outside.

87
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

88
What's the big deal?
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

89
And they knew about it?

90
Okay, look, Ross,
what is this really about?

91
Look, this is my home, and I want to
be able to come and go whenever I want.

92
Okay. I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

93
I just don't know what the big deal is.

94
The big deal is I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

95
...when I want to kick back with a puzzle...
Beer, cold beer.

96
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

97
Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?

98
No.

99
Hmm.

100
What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?

101
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

102
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

103
Joey...

104
...where did you learn that word?

105
Where do you think...

106
...Zelda?

107
- You found my book?
- Yeah, I did.

108
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

109
Okay, I'm sorry.
I went in there to take a nap.

110
And I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn.

111
Ugh.

112
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

113
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

114
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

115
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

116
You got porn.

117
- Hello.
- Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?

118
- Uh, no, no, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

119
Heh. Can I help you with something?

120
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

121
Yes, I am.

122
Great. Dad?

123
Thank you so much.
I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.

124
So, Chandler, your parents
must've been thrilled...

125
...when you told them
you were engaged.

126
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

127
I remember when we first got engaged.

128
- I don't think I've heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

129
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

130
I still don't know how.

131
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

132
What a sweet story.

133
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

134
What? They wanted a scary story.

135
Anyway, we're really excited
about our wedding plans.

136
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

137
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

138
What happened?
You still have the wedding fund, don't you?

139
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house."

140
I can't believe you spent my wedding fund
on the beach house.

141
We're sorry. We assumed...

142
...if you got married after you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

143
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

144
Which means you had seven years
of beach fun...

145
...and you can't put a price on that,
sweetie.

146
We really do feel bad about this though.

147
We started saving again
when you dated Richard.

148
But then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

149
What about when I started
dating Chandler?

150
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd ever propose.

151
Clearly I did not start drinking enough
at the start of the meal. Heh.

152
I can't believe there is no money
for my wedding.

153
We might still have some
if your father hadn't thought...

154
...to sell ice over the Internet.

155
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

156
All right, enough.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

157
Good luck, Chandler.

158
Okay, now I'm going to...

159
...touch you.

160
Oh, that's soft.

161
I can't believe this. Do you think
your parents could help pay for it?

162
I don't know.

163
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

164
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

165
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to...

166
...Dollywood.

167
What happened at dinner?

168
My parents spent the money
for our wedding.

169
My God, what did you order?

170
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

171
You guys are gonna have to get married
in, like, a rec center.

172
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.

173
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.

174
I mean, you don't need to have this...

175
...rustic Italian feast, you know?

176
And you don't need this custom-made
empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

177
You can wear off-the-rack.

178
Look, it really is gonna be okay.

179
The important thing is that we love
each other and we're gonna get married.

180
Do you even understand
what "off-the-rack" means?

181
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?

182
How? I don't have any money.

183
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

184
Well, close to...

185
- Whoa! Are you kidding me?
- What? How much?

186
- It's enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

187
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.

188
The amount you have is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

189
Oh, you guys
are so made for each other.

190
Well, you're not suggesting we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

191
Uh, yeah.

192
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

193
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

194
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.

195
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

196
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

197
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.

198
But, um, if you call our wedding a party
one more time...

199
...you may not get invited.

200
We can always earn more money, okay?
But we're only gonna get married once.

201
Look, I understand, but I have to put
my foot down, okay? The answer is no.

202
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

203
Yes, I am.

204
Wow. Money and a firm hand.

205
Finally a Chandler
I can get on board with.

206
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

207
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

208
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

209
No, no, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

210
Something's on fire.

211
No, I don't smell anything.

212
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.

213
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

214
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.

215
Hey, Rach, do you mind
if I heat this up on your loins?

216
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

217
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up, huh?

218
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

219
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

220
Well, uh, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

221
'Sup?

222
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

223
Excuse me, ladies.

224
I'm sorry?

225
My massage client, Arthur.

226
His daughter called and said
some guy that worked for me...

227
...gave him a really weird massage
this afternoon.

228
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

229
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

230
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

231
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

232
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

233
Well, he's never coming back, okay?
You just cost me $80 a week.

234
You know what? This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

235
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

236
You could've sent him away.

237
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

238
He said he liked that.

239
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

240
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

241
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

242
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
Listen, um...

244
...I've been thinking.

245
And it's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all your money on our wedding.

246
I mean, you work really hard for that.

247
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

248
Look, I thought about it too.

249
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

250
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

251
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...

252
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

253
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

254
...then that's what we're gonna do.

255
You are so sweet.

256
Oh, but wait.

257
What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

258
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.

259
So we only have two kids.

260
You know, we'll pick our favorite
and that one will get to go to college.

261
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

262
How many kids were we gonna have?

263
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

264
What else did you think about?

265
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

266
Like a small place outside the city...

267
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes and stuff.

268
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

269
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

270
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

271
You know what?

272
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

273
- Sure you do.
- No.

274
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.

275
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

276
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

277
Hey, listen, when you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

278
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.

279
- Ha, yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

280
Hello, Zelda.

281
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

282
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

283
Yeah.

284
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?

285
You keep making these stupid jokes
and these sleazy innuendoes...

286
...and it's just not funny anymore.

287
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

288
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

289
Ugh.

290
All right, you know what? That's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

291
Huh?

292
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

293
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

294
Uh, I did?

295
Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

296
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

297
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

298
Hey, you're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.

299
Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.

300
But I would keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

301
I don't want to. I'm scared.

﻿1
Hey, out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

2
Probably Monica and Chandler.

3
Hi, could I have
a pack of Newport Lights?

4
Oh, um, uh, we don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

5
That'd be great. Thanks.

6
Oh, my God.

7
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

8
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Green?

9
Melissa. Hey.

10
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

11
What's up with you?

12
Why don't I tell you over here?

13
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

14
Oh.

15
Poor Ray-Ray.

16
Oh, no, no. It's... It's good.
It's all good.

17
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

18
I will not. Heh, heh. I'm the
divisional head of men's sportswear.

19
Oh, shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

20
- Oh, please. Ha.
- Are you?

21
No.

22
Listen, we have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

23
- Oh, tomorrow. I don't know. Um...
- You're having dinner with me.

24
Shut up.

25
I've gotta go.
This has been so great, Ray-Ray.

26
Oh, there you are.

27
Um, so listen, just call me.
Here's my card.

28
Oh, wow, thanks.

29
- Oh, you're in real estate?
- Oh, no, heh, that's an old card.

30
Um, I got out of that to do something
where I could...

31
...help people and make a difference.

32
Wow. What do you do now?

33
I'm a party planner.

34
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

35
Hey guys, look who's back.
It's Ray-Ray.

36
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

37
She seems really, really fun!

38
She's actually very sweet,
and we used to be very close.

39
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you?

40
Who you what? Who you what?

41
- Yes.
- Wow!

42
Wow... Wow, what? Who you what?

43
Oh, it's not a big deal.

44
They were lovers.

45
- What?
- What?

46
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

47
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

48
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

49
...kissing for a bit.

50
So that's two of my wives.

51
Okay, so this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

52
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

53
Oh, wow!

54
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

55
...talking to the cute bartender.

56
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

57
Okay, the red ones are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

58
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

59
Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

60
Certainly not a close one.

61
- Hello.
- Hey.

62
Hey, Rach.

63
Stop picturing it!

64
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

65
Wow.
They all look like they're having fun.

66
So where are my parents gonna be?

67
Oh.

68
Well, if this is the wedding hall,
then, um...

69
...your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

70
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

71
Why would they think they're invited?

72
You got me. I don't...

73
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

74
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's parents are coming.

75
Ross' parents are coming.

76
Ross' parents are my parents.

77
Well, see, parents are coming.

78
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

79
Well, this is just sad.

80
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

81
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

82
That is not a problem.

83
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Oh, get out of here!

84
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

85
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

86
Uh, well,
thanks a lot for hooking me up.

87
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

88
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

89
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

90
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

91
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

92
- You mean, like, for award shows?
- Some of them.

93
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling, uh...

94
..."Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

95
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

96
...and a little less E!

97
Okay. Who wore those?

98
Uh...

99
- Well, uh, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

100
This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.

101
Who's that?

102
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

103
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

104
Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.

105
- Pierce Brosnan?
- Uh-huh.

106
Are you serious?

107
007?

108
This is James Bond's tux? Oh, I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

109
Ha, ha. It's a pretty cool tux.

110
Ah, it's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

111
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

112
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

113
Would Monica let me wear this?

114
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

115
I like our way.

116
- Ah!
- Hey, hey!

117
Chess!

118
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

119
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

121
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

122
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

123
Ooh, and maybe a hat.

124
- Huh. Does Monica know about this?
- No.

125
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

126
Hey, Rach,
you want to go to a movie tonight?

127
Oh, I can't.
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

128
Can I come?

129
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

130
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

131
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

132
- Joey's.
- Okay.

133
Okay, come on.

134
I had this college friend...

135
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

136
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

137
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

138
- It did.
- Sure.

139
Hey, heh. It happened.

140
Yeah, it was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

141
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

142
And we ended up kissing.
For several minutes.

143
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

144
- Why are you taking this away from me?
- Ugh.

145
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

146
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

147
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

148
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're... You know, so...

149
...vanilla.

150
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

151
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

152
To Ross.

153
If you don't believe me...

154
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

155
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

156
You should get inside my head.

157
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
Guess what I got for your wedding?

159
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

160
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

161
Batman's tux!

162
- What?
- That's right.

163
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

164
...that Batman film he was in.

165
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

166
- James Bond's tux.
- So?

167
If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

168
You need something to
to make it special?

169
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

170
You are marrying the woman you love.

171
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

172
"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.

173
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

174
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

175
- Hey.
- Hey. Okay, good. You're here.

176
All right, I figured it out.

177
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

178
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

179
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

180
Yeah. They're not coming.

181
What?

182
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

183
They feel unwanted.

184
That's too bad. It's true. But too bad.

185
- If you could just call my mom.
- Oh, Joey.

186
Come on. Just let her know
you want them there.

187
Let's not forget this is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

188
No, she hasn't.

189
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

190
What am I gonna say?

191
Just tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, no, no, blame it on the post office.

192
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

193
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

194
Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani?
Hi, this is Monica Geller.

195
I'm just calling to say that I really
hope you can make the wedding.

196
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

197
Um, I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

198
Tell me about it.

199
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

200
What are they, Irish?

201
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

202
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

203
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

204
- Oh, well.
- No.

205
- Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- Oh! Oh, that's great.

206
Mm-hm.

207
- Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

208
Yes. I was a, um,
Thigh Mega Tampon.

209
What one?

210
Yeah, we were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

211
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

212
Ugh.

213
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

214
Hmm. Mm-hm. Ugh.

215
Anyway...

216
Speaking of drinking too much,
I was, uh, telling Phoebe...

217
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

218
What?

219
Remember we... Come on, we had
sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.

220
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

221
...and we made out.

222
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

223
Really?

224
Ross is Batman.

225
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

226
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

227
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

228
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

229
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

230
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Heh. Batman has Robin.

231
We get ESPN, right?

232
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?

233
Actually I don't like martinis.

234
- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
- Ooh, yum.

235
- Hey.
- Hey.

236
I know the invitation says 6:00...

237
...but does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

238
The show?

239
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

240
But weddings start a little late, right?

241
Have you ever
been to one of my weddings?

242
Ah, well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

243
...and I want my parents to see me.

244
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

245
The wedding starts at 6.

246
Okay. I totally hear you.

247
Ooh! How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

248
Heh. You'll "vamp"?

249
Yeah, yeah, like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

250
In Joey Tribbiani, you get
a minister and an entertainer.

251
I'm a "ministainer."

252
All right?

253
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

254
Huh?

255
How can you not remember us kissing?

256
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

257
Wha...

258
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

259
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

260
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

261
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

262
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

263
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

264
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

265
No.

266
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

267
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

268
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

269
- But she didn't.
- I know.

270
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
You carry that around?

272
Yes.

273
I find it to be something
of a conversation piece.

274
- Between you and?
- Gunther.

275
Hey, hey. Why don't we put them on?

276
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

277
I would, but my pants
are a little tight.

278
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

279
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

280
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

281
Let me try it on.

282
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

283
Okay.

284
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

285
- What's this?
- Huh?

286
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

287
Oh, my God.

288
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

289
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

290
Let me see that.

291
Oh, man.

292
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

293
Hey.

294
Uh, can I talk to you guys
for a second?

295
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

296
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

297
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

298
No. I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

299
They're so happy
to get to be a part of your special day.

300
Oh.

301
Well, your welcome.
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

302
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

303
Huh?

304
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

305
...is for party time.

306
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

307
Hey, it was great meeting you.

308
And, uh, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because, uh...

309
...you know, you've gotten weird.

310
Take care, you guys.

311
Wha... Wait a minute. Okay, look.

312
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

313
I won't let you take it away from me.

314
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

315
Oh, my God. You love me.

316
- What?
- Of course I remember our kiss.

317
I think about it all the time.

318
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together, I...

319
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love.

320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

321
Aw! Look who's being suddenly shy.

322
You have to feel what I feel.

323
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

324
I'm just a good kisser.

325
Shut up.

326
I'm sorry.

327
Oh.

328
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.

329
I'm obviously kidding.

330
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

331
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

332
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

333
Anyway, I gotta go.

334
A kiss goodbye?

335
No? Okay.

336
Wow!

337
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

338
What the hell was that?

339
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

340
- And?
- I've had better.

341
I found one that fits.

342
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

343
Aw! Look at you, all handsome.

344
- Whose is it?
- Oh, does it matter?

345
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

346
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

347
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

348
Diane Keaton.

﻿1
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

2
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
You realize you get louder each week?

4
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

5
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.

6
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

7
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

9
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
Say what's in your heart.

11
Look at her go.
She must love me more than I love her!

12
What's wrong with me?
Ooh, don't open that door.

13
Phew. "Monica, there are no words..."

14
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

15
Uh... Oh! You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

16
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

17
She made no such promise.

18
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

19
What's the emergency?

20
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

21
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

22
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

23
Those are my eyes!

24
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

25
Why don't you start
with something simple?

26
Like, um:

27
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you."

28
I can't do that.

29
Everyone, this is Chandler.

30
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

31
Okay.

32
Okay, okay.
Um, maybe you could start with:

33
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

34
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more."

35
All right, there's a nuclear
holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.

36
Would you go out with me?

37
Ooh! Are we allowed
to lie in the vows?

38
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

39
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

40
Or all the things you taught him.

41
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

42
...four, five, six and seven.

43
There are seven?

44
- That's one?
- Heh, heh. Kind of an important one.

45
I was looking at it upside down.

46
Ha. You know, sometimes that helps.

47
Okay, start out with a little one...

48
...a two, a one-two-three...

49
...a three, a five...

50
...a four, a three-two...

51
...two, a two-four-six.

52
Two-four-six, four, two...

53
...two, four-seven...

54
...five-seven, six-seven...

55
...seven, seven...

56
...seven, seven, seven...

57
...seven!

58
Seven.

59
Oh! I got it.
How about something like:

60
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

61
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

62
Look back over your time together.

63
Oh, look, twins!

64
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

65
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

66
All right, I'll tell you what.

67
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

68
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

69
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

70
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

71
No, no.

72
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

73
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

74
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

75
I'm getting married today!

76
Think he knew I was here?

77
Nice try.

78
Wait, wait, wait.

79
- Look, Monica...
- Ah!

80
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

81
You are so great! I love you.

82
What?

83
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

84
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

85
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

86
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

87
Stop it! Stop it!

88
You know, I was thinking,
what if I, uh, unpack here?

89
Then all your stuff would be here.

90
Well...

91
What if it was here?

92
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

93
Doesn't make any sense.

94
Okay.

95
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

96
We wanted to surprise you.

97
Oh, my God!

98
Chandler...

99
...in all my life...

100
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

101
...as to fall in love with my best...

102
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

103
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

104
I thought...

105
I can do this.

106
I thought...

107
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

108
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

109
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

110
And if you let me...

111
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

112
Monica?

113
Will you marry me?

114
Yes.

115
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

116
Come in! Come in!

117
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

118
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

120
Uh, helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

121
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

122
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

123
How's Monica doing?

124
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

125
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

126
Let's just hope it works.

127
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

128
Heh. That's not true.

129
You're right. How's the missus?

130
I can't believe...

131
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

132
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

133
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

134
I've had a very long, hard day.

135
- Uh, I'm getting chicken. Want some?
- Uh, no. Bye, then.

136
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

137
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

138
Chicken?

139
I could eat some chicken.

140
Hey, Joe!

141
Can I get a, uh, three-piece,
uh, coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

142
Diet Coke.

143
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

144
You? And you?

145
You cannot tell. No one knows.

146
How? When?

147
- It happened in London.
- In London?

148
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

149
But it is a big deal!

150
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

151
- You can't.
- Please!

152
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

153
All right!

154
I can't wait to be with you.

155
I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry.

156
Laundry, huh? Is that my new nickname?

157
Aw.

158
You know your nickname, Mr. Big...

159
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

160
Chandler and Monica!

161
Oh, my God!

162
- Aah! Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

163
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

164
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

165
I know! I know!

166
- You know?
- Yes!

167
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

168
Hey, what's going on?

169
What? What?

170
We're excited that you
might get this place!

171
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

172
Get in here! Come on!

173
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

174
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

175
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

176
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

177
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

178
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

179
- Bye.
- Bye.

180
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

181
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

182
Actually, I did.

183
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

184
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

185
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

186
Them? Who's them?

187
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

188
Joey!

189
And Rachel.

190
They made me promise not to tell.

191
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

192
They don't know that we know
that they know.

193
- So...
- Ah, yes!

194
The messers become the messees!

195
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

196
- Are you kidding?
- No.

197
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

198
Joey? Do they know that we know?

199
- No.
- Joey!

200
- They know you know.
- Ugh! I knew it!

201
I cannot believe those two!

202
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

203
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

204
Joey, you can't say anything.

205
Couldn't if I wanted to.

206
This is totally getting out of hand.

207
- She wants me to put lotion on her!
- She's bluffing!

208
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

209
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

210
Oh, man.
Aren't you guys done yet?

211
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

212
- Ooh, I like that.
- Okay.

213
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

214
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

215
It's not my first time.

216
You go seduce her until she cracks.

217
Okay, give me a second.

218
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

219
Oh, you're, uh, going?

220
Um, not without you, lover.

221
So, this is my bra.

222
It's very, very nice.

223
Well, come here.

224
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

225
You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.

226
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

227
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

228
Here it comes.

229
Our first kiss.

230
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

231
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

232
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

233
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

234
I love you, Monica.

235
I love you too, Chandler.

236
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

237
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

238
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

239
No.

240
What are you doing?

241
Get off my sister!

242
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

243
Think it'll be different?

244
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

245
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

246
And maybe they'll leave the city...

247
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

248
Things change.

249
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

250
It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.

251
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

252
Who's this little naked guy?

253
Uh, that naked guy would be me.

254
- Ha, aw, look at the little thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.

255
Yes.

256
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

257
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

258
Oh, that's Nana right there.

259
- Wow.
- Let's see.

260
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

261
Wow. Monica, you look like
your grandma. How old was she?

262
Let's see, 1939.

263
Yeah, uh, 24, 25.

264
Huh. Looks like a fun gang.

265
Ooh! Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

266
Let me see.

267
No, that would be me again.

268
Hey, you guys.

269
- Hey.
- Hey.

270
- What's going on?
- Well, we were just talking about...

271
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

272
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

273
- That's so sweet.
- Hmm.

274
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

275
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

276
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
- Aw.
- Oh.

278
Oh, that's beautiful.

279
Funny one! Good!

280
Will you marry me?

281
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What? I don't get it.

282
Oh, yeah!

283
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

284
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

285
Okay, what do you think?

286
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

287
- You really like it?
- Dude!

288
How did you write this?

289
I stole Monica's
and changed the name. Shh.

290
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first he can!

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

3
Can I get the keys?
I'll take that bad boy for a spin.

4
Ross drives it? When I ask,
you say you're the only one allowed to.

5
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he couldn't hurt it.

6
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

7
Whatever, Ross.

8
Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights
after you're done.

9
- Hey.
- Hi.

10
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

11
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

12
Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.

13
So much for the "you can drive it
but don't tell Rachel" plan.

14
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

15
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you can talk about is the wedding.

16
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

17
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

18
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

19
You got a couple hours?

20
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

21
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

22
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

23
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

24
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

25
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me, huh?

26
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

27
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

28
- Give me a brush.
- Give me the keys.

29
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

30
Fine. It doesn't matter.

31
If I remember correctly, there's a comb
on the floor of the bathroom.

32
Alimony.

33
We still haven't gotten an RSVP
from your dad.

34
Oh, right. Um, maybe that's because
I didn't send him an invitation.

35
Chandler, he's your father.
He should be at your wedding.

36
I don't even know him.
I haven't seen him in years.

37
And when he finds out he wasn't asked?

38
We don't run in the same circles.

39
I hang out with you guys and he...

40
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

41
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.

42
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

43
...when the groom's father's
wearing a backless dress.

44
Heh, so what?

45
As long as he's not wearing
a white dress and a veil, I don't care.

46
I think I need to do some shopping.

47
Ah.

48
Ooh, nice.

49
My God!

50
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

51
There's no way I'll let you drive this car.

52
- Just hand over the keys.
- Oh.

53
Oh, ah-ah-ah!

54
Do not start this car.

55
Okay, okay. I will give you 20 bucks...

56
...if you get out of this car right now. Hey!

57
Look.

58
If you're so freaked out, get in the car.

59
With you? Yeah, right.

60
All right.

61
Okay, okay, okay.

62
- What are you doing? Get in front.
- In the death seat?

63
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

64
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back.

65
- Wait a minute.
- What?

66
Oh.

67
Ooh!

68
Oops.

69
Whoa, oh, that one kept going.

70
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

71
- How long have you been going out?
- A month.

72
Wow. We ought to get to
know each other better.

73
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh...

74
What's your name?

75
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

76
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

77
Me too. There's a game Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

78
Great! Let me make sure
I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

79
Here.

80
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

81
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

82
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

83
We're not eloping. I love the flowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

84
We're going to see your dad.

85
I want to get to know my father-in-law.

86
We already went over this and I won.

87
No, you didn't. Honey, just so you know...

88
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

89
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

90
I know your dad embarrassed you.

91
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

92
You need a new word
for what I went through.

93
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

94
...dressed as a Hollywood starlet.

95
It's hard enough to be 14.

96
You're skinny, wearing Speedos
your mom promised you'd grow into.

97
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

98
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with real fruit...

99
...that he'll later give to your friends
as a healthy snack.

100
The point is that he was at every one
of your swim meets cheering you on.

101
That's a pretty great dad.

102
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

103
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?

104
Chandler...

105
You're not 14 anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

106
If he's not at your wedding,
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

107
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

108
Yes!

109
- I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

110
- Pheebs.
- Hey.

111
You know how, uh, when you're wearing pants
and you lean forward...

112
...I check out your underwear?

113
Yeah.

114
- Well, when Jake did it...
- Mm-hm.

115
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

116
I know. They were mine.

117
Oh.

118
No, no, wait. That's weird.

119
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

120
That's weird!

121
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

122
I think so too. And that little flap?
Great for holding my lipstick.

123
I wouldn't know about that.

124
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

125
He loves how silk feels against his skin.

126
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

127
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

128
I think, more than you.

129
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

130
Only a man completely secure
with his masculinity...

131
...could walk around in women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

132
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

133
You've seen my huge stack of porn.

134
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?

135
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

136
I have got to get my license renewed.

137
You don't have a valid driver's license?
Pull over right now.

138
You're so tense. You just gotta relax, okay?

139
Okay? Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

140
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

141
I am not horsing around, okay?

142
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

143
Uh-oh.

144
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

145
Really? You think so?

146
I'm talking to myself. You're going down!

147
I can feel something inside me say

148
Has someone taken your order?

149
Oh, yeah. She did. Um, he did. She?
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...

150
Mm-hm.

151
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

152
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

153
I don't want him to know
we're here yet. I'm not ready.

154
He won't be too happy to see me either.

155
Why not?

156
I don't know if I told you this,
but he's kind of tried to contact me...

157
...a lot over the last few years.
- What?

158
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

159
He even came to New York.
I said I was too busy.

160
It's very "Cat's in the Cradle."
I don't want to get into it.

161
Here we go.

162
Ladies and gentlemen...

163
...please welcome the incomparable
Helena Handbasket.

164
Hello, darlings.

165
And there's Daddy.

166
Okay. Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

167
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Ugh, come on!

168
What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.

169
I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.

170
God!

171
Hi, officer. Was I going a little too fast?

172
Oh, my God.

173
- Can I see your license, please?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

174
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

175
And then he, um...

176
Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.

177
- Your license.
- Yes. Ahem. Here you go, Officer, uh...

178
...Handsome.

179
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

180
Dear Lord!

181
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

182
This is a great picture.

183
Ah!

184
Really? You think so?
You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.

185
You look phenomenal.

186
She should! It was taken 10 years ago!

187
You know, you're probably, um...

188
Probably wondering about the old date.

189
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?

190
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

191
- Taurus?
- No.

192
- Virgo?
- No.

193
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

194
I knew it. I knew it!

195
- You won't speed anymore, right?
- I won't speed.

196
- Promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

197
Let him drive. Does he have a license?

198
- Yeah.
- Can he handle a stick?

199
- Oh, well...
- I can handle a stick!

200
I feel pretty

201
Oh, so pretty

202
I feel pretty and witty and

203
Gay

204
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

205
- Oh, my God!
- What?

206
That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.

207
For I'm loved

208
By a pretty wonderful boy

209
Hello, and welcome to the show.

210
I see some of our regulars in the audience.

211
And a couple of irregulars.

212
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

213
Oh, much better. You're invisible now.

214
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

215
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

216
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

217
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

218
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

219
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

220
Can we have our drinks, please?
Uh, waiter? ...tress?

221
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

222
Check it out.

223
Huh?

224
How much of a man am I?

225
Wow, nice. Manly, and also kind of a slut.

226
You know, I'm beginning to see
what Jake was talking about.

227
- Uh-huh.
- The silk feels really good.

228
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

229
That's great.

230
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

231
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: Cotton, silk, lace.

232
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

233
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

234
- I should go take these off.
- I think it's important you do.

235
Mm.

236
What's your name?

237
Chandler.

238
Chandler?

239
What an unusual name.

240
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

241
Oh, they're a hoot.

242
And who is your friend?

243
I'm Monica.

244
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

245
I'm not very fond of New York.

246
Queens, I like.

247
Ooh, what is this...

248
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

249
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

250
Really?

251
Congratulations.

252
When's the big day?

253
In two weeks.

254
I see.

255
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

256
So you're bald.

257
Wait, wait.

258
We'd really love it if you could be there.

259
Really?

260
I know it would make me happy...

261
...ma'am.

262
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

263
Oh, I'm getting all misty here. Ha!

264
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

265
- You okay?
- Yeah.

266
Thanks for making me do this.

267
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...

268
...how lucky they are to have
found each other.

269
In every life a little rain must fall.

270
Fortunately...

271
...in my life...

272
It's raining men

273
Hallelujah

274
- It's raining men, uh-huh
- Amen

275
When I was growing up,
I played the one on the far left.

276
And it's raining men, amen

277
Remind me to introduce you to someone.

278
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

279
What?

280
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

281
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

282
Maybe it's, uh, Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

283
It's a different guy.

284
- Good evening, officer.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

285
Uh, no, I don't, but it could not
have been more than 60.

286
You're right. It was 37.

287
You're not ticketing me
for driving too slow, are you?

288
That's right.

289
You know, officer, I, uh...

290
I had the weirdest dream last night.

291
Oh, my God!

292
Your license, please.

293
You don't want to hear about my dream...

294
...Officer...

295
...Pretty?

296
It's Petty.

297
I'll be right back with your ticket.

298
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

299
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Much. Heh.

300
Listen, uh...

301
Not that I'm insecure about
my manhood or anything, but, uh...

302
...I need to hook up with
a woman right now.

303
- I understand.
- Yeah, okay.

304
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

305
You look familiar. Do I know you?

306
I don't think so.

307
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

308
- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.
- Wow. Really?

309
- Four-fifty, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

310
These are for you.

﻿1
Do you realize this is the last time
we'll be here in the coffeehouse...

2
...as six single people?

3
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
Oh! Okay.

5
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

6
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

7
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

8
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

9
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with mom.

10
Joey, you too?

11
I just heard "lunch."

12
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

13
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

14
I need to talk to you
about something.

15
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

16
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow.

17
No, it's not that.

18
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

19
...but as Monica's older brother.

20
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

21
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

22
- Do I still call you Ross?
- Okay.

23
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

24
But as Monica's older brother,
I have to tell you this:

25
If you ever hurt my little sister...

26
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

27
...I will hunt you down...

28
...and kick your ass.

29
What? I'm serious.

30
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

31
...and thanks for the warning.

32
No problem.

33
So are we friends again?

34
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35
Ahem. You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

36
What you doing, Mon?

37
I'm listing all the things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
So I can be prepared.

39
- Mm-hm. What are they?
- "The dresses won't get picked up...

40
...veil gets lost,
and I'm missing something blue."

41
Those are all the things I'm responsible for.

42
I had to go with the odds.

43
Hey! You guys!

44
Remember I had that audition a while ago,
and I didn't get that part?

45
- The commercial?
- No.

46
- That play?
- No.

47
- That other play?
- No.

48
- The movie?
- Yes!

49
- The one about the pilot and his dog?
- No.

50
But man, that one hurt.

51
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

52
Back then we called it
"The Great War."

53
It really was.

54
A guy they wanted backed out
and now they want me! I start shooting today!

55
Congratulations!

56
- Today's the rehearsal dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

57
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

58
See you.
I'm off to fight the Nazis.

59
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWll, not WWI.

60
Whoa. Okay.

61
Who was in WWI?

62
Go ahead.

63
- You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
- Yeah, I'll see you.

64
Who did we fight in WWI?

65
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

66
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

67
Richard, we're ready for you.

68
Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
is playing Vincent.

69
- I'm doing my scenes with you?
- Nice to meet you.

70
I can't believe this. Incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

71
No, I didn't.

72
I think you did.

73
I think I lost, three times.

74
- Uh, cookie? Would you?
- No.

75
Okay. We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

76
- So, uh, can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

77
All right. Let's do it.

78
And action!

79
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget the platoon. The platoon is gone!

80
- What?
- The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

81
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

82
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

83
Hang on. Joey, you keep
touching your face.

84
Something wrong?

85
No.

86
I, uh...

87
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

88
He's a face toucher.

89
I don't think so.

90
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

91
We may not have any weapons,
but we still have food.

92
Potatoes, pasta...

93
...and a few tins of tuna!

94
- Honey, we gotta go!
- Okay.

95
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

96
My dad just called and wants to know if he can
borrow one of your pearl necklaces?

97
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

98
No.

99
I've only met him once
but I'm guessing, plunging?

100
He is more of a "If you've got it,
flaunt it" kind of father.

101
I don't have anything
but let me see if Rachel does.

102
Yes, include more people
in this.

103
Hey. Do you realize that tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

104
I have a date tomorrow night.

105
- I can't believe we made it.
- You don't have to sound so surprised.

106
I'm sorry, but...

107
- Nothing.
- What?

108
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

109
...I've waited for you to flip out.

110
Honestly? Me too.

111
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
I think that something
stupid will come up and I'll...

113
...go all Chandler.

114
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

115
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

116
It's made me stay calm.

117
- I could've been worse.
- Okay.

118
I'll be right there.

119
Hi, if you're calling before Saturday...

120
...you've reached Monica and Chandler.

121
But if you're calling after Saturday,
you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.

122
Please leave a message for
the Bings!

123
- Maureen!
- Hi.

124
- Gosh. This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

125
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

126
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

127
Wow, Monica.

128
So you know, I had my
older-brother talk with Chandler.

129
- What is that?
- Well, I...

130
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

131
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

132
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

133
I would kick his ass!

134
Ross, please, my makeup!

135
Hi.

136
- Chandler.
- Mom.

137
Thanks for wearing... something.

138
Ohh. This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

139
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

140
I can't believe I have to go back to work
after this and get spit on again.

141
You're lucky. At least the people
who spit on you are famous.

142
- Who spits on you?
- I don't wanna talk about work.

143
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

144
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

145
Jack!

146
What? I've never seen one before.

147
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

148
I didn't even have a chance to act
as if I'm okay with it.

149
Hello, all.

150
Hi... Dad.

151
Hi, Mr. Bing.

152
- Nora.
- Charles.

153
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

154
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

155
Aren't you too old
to wear a dress like that?

156
Don't you have too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

157
Oh, my God.

158
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

159
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

160
Thanks, you guys.

161
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

162
Do me a favor. Talk to Chandler's dad
and keep him away from Chandler's mom.

163
- Yeah, but I don't know what he looks like.
- He is the man in a black dress.

164
Hi. I'm Rachel, a friend of
Monica and Chandler's.

165
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

166
"A man, duh!"

167
Could I have your attention?

168
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

169
Dad, please. As I was saying...

170
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

171
Uh, and I'm the best man.

172
And this marriage
is doubly special for me...

173
...um, because not only is the groom
my best friend...

174
...but, uh, the bride is my little sister.

175
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

176
Please join me in raising a glass...

177
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

178
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

179
I'm gonna steam my dress.

180
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

181
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

182
- I said I'll do it.
- Nobody?

183
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

184
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

185
And thanks for putting my grandmother
in the cab to get to the hotel.

186
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

187
Ugh! Pssh.

188
What grandmother?

189
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

190
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

191
- Nice shades.
- If I wear these in my scenes...

192
...I won't get spit in my eyes.

193
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
was the official sponsor of WWI.

194
Great! All right!

195
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

196
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room. See you.

197
Chandler?

198
- Hey.
- Hi.

199
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

200
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

201
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

202
Oh, my God.

203
What's up?

204
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

205
Tell her yourself.

206
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

207
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

208
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk."

209
Or maybe he was writing to tell
her that he's changed his name:

210
"Tell Monica, I'm Sorry."

211
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

212
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

213
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

214
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

215
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

216
But, if you don't find him
and bring him back...

217
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

218
I will find him.

219
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

220
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

221
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

222
I found the picture!

223
Picture? What picture?

224
The picture of my wife!
I found it in your pack!

225
Could you lower the script?

226
I don't want to.

227
I need to see your face so
I can play off your reaction.

228
Okay, look.

229
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

230
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

231
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

232
That's what real actors do.

233
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

234
And when you enunciate, you spit!

235
Wow. Didn't know that.

236
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

237
Picture? What picture?

238
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

239
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

240
Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.

241
- See you at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

242
Then we'll see you
the day after tomorrow.

243
Mom? Dad?

244
What are you doing here?

245
You kids talk about this place so much,
we thought we'd see what the fuss is all about.

246
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

247
The sexy blond behind the counter.

248
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

249
- Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

250
I know what the list is.

251
Sit down, have a cup of joe.

252
I can't, I'm sorry.

253
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

254
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

255
Action!

256
I found the picture!

257
What picture?

258
A picture of my wife, in your pack!

259
You went through my personal property?

260
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

261
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

262
...for two years!

263
Cut! Wonderful!

264
Great scene, huh?

265
You were awesome.
In that last speech, you soaked me.

266
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

267
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

268
I have plans. Important plans!

269
- Still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

270
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th.

271
Okay, well there's one down.

272
I'm getting married today!

273
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

274
My day is finally here!

275
She might not even notice he's gone.

276
I'm gonna start getting ready!

277
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

278
She'll be in the gown,
and he won't show up.

279
Then she'll
have to take off the gown...

280
Stop it. You can't do this here.

281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

282
It's just so sad.

283
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

284
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know.

285
There's no tissue.

286
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

287
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

288
- I found one.
- Okay.

289
Thank you.

290
Oh, God.

291
Can I have another one?

292
Sure.

293
Do you need some floss?

294
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

295
Here's a whole bunch.

296
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

297
...and people will be whispering,
"That poor girl."

298
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

299
- Oh, my God.
- What?

300
There was a pregnancy test
in the garbage, and it's positive.

301
Monica's pregnant.

302
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

303
Next time on Friends:

304
- We've gotta tell her that he's gone.
- No, we can't.

305
She's gonna start getting ready soon.

306
Can't you stall her a little?

307
I'm never gonna get married.

308
We've just got one short scene.
It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.

309
- Are you drunk?
- No!

310
- Yes, you are!
- All right.

311
- How's Chandler?
- Great!

312
- Where are you?
- On the set.

313
This is turning into the worst
wedding day ever.

﻿1
Oh, my God.

2
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby.

3
Can this count as her "something new"?

4
Oh, my God.

5
Do you think this is why Chandler took off?

6
She had to have just taken it.
I took out the trash last night.

7
It's turning into the worst wedding ever.

8
The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing
and I'm holding this.

9
Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.

10
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

11
Do you know what kind
of birth control she uses?

12
No. Why?

13
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

14
Anything?

15
No. I talked to Joey.
He hasn't heard from him.

16
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

17
- You said he was missing?
- No.

18
It seemed like I called to chat.

19
Pretty sure they both think I'm interested.

20
- We've got to tell her.
- No, we can't.

21
She'll start getting ready soon.

22
Can't you stall her?
I'll go to the places I went last night.

23
How much time?

24
How long before she has to get ready?

25
- One hour.
- Give me two.

26
Then why do you ask?

27
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

28
Why?

29
You're tired. You looked all night.
And clearly, you suck at this.

30
See you later.

31
Wait, do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

32
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

33
Let's start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

34
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

35
About what?

36
I'm never gonna get married.

37
You will. The right guy's around the corner.

38
Okay, are we done with that?

39
No, I'm serious.

40
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

41
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

42
Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey.

43
Rachel? Are you okay?

44
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

45
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

46
It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating...

47
...so I really can't work past 4.

48
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

49
It's not like it's your wedding.

50
I'm having surgery.

51
What?

52
I made up the wedding,
because I didn't want you to worry.

53
But I'm having surgery today.

54
What kind of surgery?

55
Transplant.

56
You're supposed to work on Monday.

57
Hair transplant.

58
But you're not bald.

59
It's not on my head.

60
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

61
We've got one scene. It's just you
and Richard, and he's a pro.

62
You'll be fine.

63
Morning, Richard.

64
Hey, you're here. Great. Let's go, buddy.

65
We got a scene to shoot.

66
I'm wearing two belts.

67
- Are you drunk?
- No.

68
Yes, you are.

69
All right.

70
So this is your office?

71
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

72
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

73
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

74
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

75
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

76
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

77
If I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.

78
I can't be the Bings.

79
What's wrong with it?

80
The Bings have bad marriages.

81
They yell, fight, and use the pool boy...

82
...as a pawn in their sexual games.

83
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

84
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

85
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

86
Only Paul Newman can make marriage work.

87
And I am no Paul Newman.

88
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

89
But look, Chandler...

90
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

91
But I totally believe you can do this.

92
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid...

93
Ahem. It's too huge.

94
You're right. It is huge.

95
So let's take it just a little bit at a time.

96
Forget getting married for a sec.

97
Can you just come home and take a shower?

98
That's not scary, right?

99
Depends on what you mean by "we."

100
The nights are the hardest.

101
But then the day comes...

102
...and that's every bit as hard as the night.

103
- Then the night comes...
- Days and nights are hard, I get it.

104
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

105
I know. At dusk.

106
That's such a hard time for me.

107
I'm gonna put makeup on.
We have to be there in an hour.

108
- Wait.
- What?

109
Let's go to lunch.

110
I can't go to lunch.

111
Right.

112
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

113
What's going on?

114
Okay.

115
All right, honey, listen.

116
When I tell you what I'm
about to tell you, remember...

117
...that we're all here for you,
and we love you.

118
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

119
We can't find Chandler...

120
His vest.

121
We can't find Chandler's vest.

122
How can that be? Wait, are you serious?

123
Found the vest.

124
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

125
Ah.

126
Oh, wow. Okay, don't
scare me like that, okay?

127
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God. The worst has happened."

128
So you two were married, huh?

129
What happened, you just drift apart?

130
Here comes the bride.

131
Oh, my God, Monica.

132
I want to wear this every day.

133
You look so beautiful.

134
I'm so happy for me.

135
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

136
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it.

137
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

138
The wedding is in less than an hour.

139
I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get it.

140
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

141
No, I'm the minister.

142
Put them both on the phone
and I'll marry them right now.

143
Joey, I have to go.

144
Don't hang up on me. I'll marry you
and me right now. I have the power.

145
There you go. You put on a tuxedo.

146
That wasn't scary, was it?

147
No.

148
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.

149
Okay. What's the next little bit?

150
- Getting married.
- Oh, ah.

151
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

152
- Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
- Yeah.

153
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

154
I'm not gonna run away.
I just want some fresh air.

155
- Okay.
- Okay.

156
Oh, fresh air.

157
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you overreacted.

158
We gotta do something.

159
Joey won't make it,
so I'll look around for other weddings.

160
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

161
Okay.

162
"Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding."
Excellent.

163
Congratulations.

164
Mazel tov.

165
Hi. Oh, great hat.

166
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

167
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?

168
Yeah. Yeah.

169
They're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.

170
And Chandler Acidophilus.

171
Hi. Hi.

172
Hi.

173
Has anyone seen Chandler?

174
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

175
We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek.

176
You can't ask us, son. That's cheating.

177
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

178
He can't come here and see
the bride in her wedding dress.

179
When we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

180
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

181
Honey, it isn't good luck.

182
Oh, my God. Monica.

183
I know.

184
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

185
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

186
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

187
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

188
Why would you play hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a flight risk?

189
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

190
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

191
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

192
So I just talked to the director.

193
That's it. We're done for the day.

194
We finished the scene?

195
- Yeah. You were wonderful.
- As were you.

196
So I got your car. It's right outside.

197
Thank you. You're welcome.

198
No, we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.

199
Is that my ass?

200
- There he is!
- What?

201
Hey! Whoa!

202
You won't get away this time!

203
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about.

204
- Ross.
- Hi-yah!

205
I'm serious.
You're not walking out on my sister.

206
That's right. I'm not.

207
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

208
- You know?
- What?

209
- I heard you and Rachel talking.
- About what?

210
You don't know?

211
If somebody doesn't tell me right now...

212
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

213
Monica's pregnant.

214
Oh, my God.

215
Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?

216
I was. Then I went to
the gift shop for cigarettes.

217
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please.

218
So I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this...

219
And I thought anything that can
fit into this can't be scary.

220
You obviously didn't see Chuckie III.

221
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

222
So I got it to give Monica,
so she'd know I was okay.

223
Dude.

224
Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.

225
Our little boy is getting married.

226
Look at you, so handsome.

227
You look beautiful, Mom.

228
You look beautiful too, Dad.

229
I love you both.

230
I'm so glad you're here.

231
Are you Chandler?

232
Are you Joey?

233
- Huh. This is nice.
- What?

234
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

235
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

236
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

237
Congratulations, darling.

238
We love you, sweetheart.

239
You look beautiful.

240
- Is this new?
- Not now.

241
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

242
He's Greek Orthodox.

243
As are you.

244
Let us begin.

245
Dearly beloved...

246
That's my line.

247
I can take it from here. Thanks.

248
Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.

249
You may be confused by this now...

250
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

251
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

252
We are gathered here today...

253
...to join this man...

254
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

255
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I can't...

256
...imagine two people more perfect
for each other.

257
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

258
...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?

259
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

260
Chandler, for so long...

261
...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.

262
My soul mate.

263
Then three years ago, at another wedding...

264
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

265
And instead, I found everything that
I'd been looking for my whole life.

266
And now...

267
...here we are...

268
...with our future before us.

269
And I only want to spend it with you.

270
My prince. My soul mate.

271
My friend.

272
Unless you don't want to.

273
You go.

274
Chandler?

275
No, that's okay.

276
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

277
But when I saw you walking down that aisle,
I realized it's simple.

278
I love you.

279
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I will always love you.

280
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

281
You want to know if I'm sure?

282
You may now kiss the bride.

283
So...

284
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the State of New York...

285
...and the Internet guys...

286
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.

287
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

288
- I do.
- I do.

289
Yeah, you do.

290
Rings?

291
Oh, crap.

292
Let's do the rings.

293
We good? Yeah? Good?

294
Once again...

295
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

296
Now kiss her again.

297
I love you.

298
And I know about the baby.

299
- What baby?
- Our baby.

300
We have a baby?

301
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

302
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

303
Then who did?

304
Look at them.

305
And they're gonna have a baby.

306
Uh-huh.

﻿1
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
So, what do you think?

3
- About what?
- What?

4
Are you kidding? Okay,
I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.

5
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

6
Chandler's eyes!

7
I got glasses.

8
You always had glasses.

9
No, I didn't.

10
Are you sure?

11
Didn't you used to have a pair?

12
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of, um...

13
- Feminine.
- Yes!

14
No.

15
I think the glasses look great.
They make you look sexy.

16
- Really?
- Yeah.

17
You didn't think
I used to wear glasses, right?

18
- Of course.
- Pfft.

19
I had no idea.

20
What do you want for
an engagement present?

21
Oh, that's okay, we're not having a party...

22
...so you don't have to get us...
- Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.

23
If someone wants to give us a present,
we don't want to deprive them of that joy.

24
Oh, you should get them
one of those little CD players.

25
Oh, I already have one.

26
Unless someone borrowed it
and left it at the gynecologist.

27
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

28
Hey, I know what I want!

29
- What we want, honey.
- No, you don't want this.

30
I want to have your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

31
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

32
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- The one my grandmother...

33
...made me swear on her deathbed...

34
...that I would never
let out of our family?

35
Dying people say the craziest things.

36
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

37
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

38
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

39
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

40
- Ahoy!
- Hey.

41
- How's the boat?
- I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

42
You finally took it out of the marina?

43
Why would I do that?

44
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

45
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

46
It's a great place
to just kind of sit...

47
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

48
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

49
Joey, I could teach you
to sail if you want.

50
- You could?
- Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.

51
When I was 15,
my dad bought me my own boat.

52
- Your own boat?
- He was trying to cheer me up.

53
My pony was sick.

54
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

55
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

56
- Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
- Why, do you have a lecture?

57
- No, why?
- Then, free as a bird. What's up?

58
Uh, my dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

59
Wow, that's great! Dad must like you.

60
- He doesn't ask just anyone to play.
- He didn't really ask for you.

61
He asked for "Chauncey."
I assumed he meant you.

62
Did you correct him?

63
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

64
Maybe this is something
you could do this every week.

65
Or you could sit on the porch...

66
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

67
He does that every week too.

68
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

69
Oh, no problem.
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

70
You're not a lefty?

71
Does anybody know me?

72
What's wrong, Phoebe?

73
I just went to my old apartment
to get you the cookie recipe...

74
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

75
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...

76
...and keep it at least 100 yards
away from the original?

77
Because I'm normal.

78
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

79
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

80
We have to get you
an engagement present?

81
Don't worry about it.

82
No one got me an engagement present.

83
Okay, here.
I don't have the recipe, but here.

84
I wish you health
and happiness.

85
An old cookie?

86
See, this is what happens
when you don't register for gifts.

87
I made a batch and I froze it.
And this is the only one left.

88
- We can't accept this.
- Why not?

89
Because it's gross.

90
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

91
I do this at work all the time.

92
- Really?
- Yeah, I think I can.

93
Oh, yay!

94
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

95
Two! I've been engaged twice.

96
Look at this clown.

97
Because he's got a bigger boat
he thinks he can take up the whole river.

98
Get out of the way, jackass!

99
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

100
- That is the Coast Guard.
- What are they doing out here?

101
The coast is all the way over there.

102
Joey, just ignore the boats.

103
- We're not finished with our lesson.
- All right.

104
I'm gonna go over the basic
points one more time.

105
Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay?
Let's start sailing!

106
I want to go over there
where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!

107
Oh, is that what you wanna do?

108
You want to give a shout out
to the old hot chicas?

109
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

110
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

111
- Uh, boat rope?
- Wrong.

112
- How do you get the mainsail up?
- Uh...

113
Rub it?

114
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

115
I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.

116
No, no, I know this one.
I know this one. Uh, um...

117
Time's up. Now you're dead.

118
And deaf!

119
Okay, you go on
and make your little jokes.

120
If you don't know
what you're doing at sea...

121
...you will die at sea.
Am I getting through to you, sailor?

122
- Yes.
- Don't just say yes.

123
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

124
So do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

125
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

126
- All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
- You do?

127
You don't? Heh.
Well, that's the difference...

128
...between a professional and a layman.

129
That and arrogance.

130
Hey.

131
Hey. How was sailing?

132
I don't want to talk about it.

133
- You could've saved me a whole cookie.
- No!

134
Women are mean!

135
I can't believe that.

136
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...

137
...this crumb.

138
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

139
- Hey.
- How was it?

140
Well, I had a great time.

141
Um, Chauncey on the other hand...

142
I will tell the story.

143
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...

144
...he even said I could call him Dad.

145
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

146
"Daddy."

147
Look, here's the story.

148
We had just finished playing racquetball...

149
...and we were gonna take a steam.

150
I walk into the steam room...

151
...and it's really steamy.

152
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.

153
Guys?

154
- Over here.
- Have a seat, son.

155
Hey!

156
- Oh, my God, Chandler! I can't believe it.
- I know.

157
You gave my father a lap dance.

158
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

159
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

160
Why, okay? Why?
Why did that have to happen?

161
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

162
Not that big a deal? There...

163
There was touching of things.

164
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

165
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

166
Listen, I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
He probably thought this was funny.

167
He'll be telling this story for years.

168
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

169
Oh, but he will.

170
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

171
I wasn't escaping.

172
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

173
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

174
You were trying to eat it.

175
If that is your father calling
to tell this story...

176
...then the marriage is off!

177
Come on. Hello.

178
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

179
Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.

180
- All right, I'm off to see your dad.
- Oh, whoa.

181
Aren't you a little overdressed?

182
Yeah, and you better make sure
he tips you this time.

183
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...

184
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

185
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

186
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

187
Are you getting Monica
and Chandler an engagement present?

188
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

189
Thank you!

190
- Hey.
- Hey.

191
Well, hello.

192
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

193
Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way
to say this, but, never.

194
- Why not?
- Because you're mean on the boat.

195
Wha...? I was just trying to teach you.

196
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

197
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

198
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

199
She wouldn't let me help out at all.

200
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.
But you couldn't move your arms...

201
...because you were wearing
three life jackets.

202
You have to respect the sea.

203
Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

204
But I tell you something,
that was not mean.

205
My father is mean. He used to yell at me
all the time on the boat.

206
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

207
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead!"

208
Does a good student drink 7 beers
during his first lesson?

209
Six and a half.

210
You knocked that last one
out of my hand.

211
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

212
Well, it hit me anyway.

213
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

214
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and, uh, stop yelling.

215
- You won't boss me around?
- I won't boss you around.

216
- And you'll be nice?
- I'll be nice.

217
- And you'll be topless?
- And I... Joey!

218
You want me to learn?

219
Okay, here's batch 22.

220
Maybe these'll taste
like your grandmother's.

221
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

222
- Mm. Let's give it a shot.
- Ugh.

223
I have not made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

224
- What was that for, a bake sale?
- No, just a Friday night.

225
Mm. These are pretty good.

226
- Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
- Mm-mm.

227
Which one was that?

228
The ones we had
after you almost threw up.

229
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

230
I did not like batch 16.

231
I'm okay.

232
Are there any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

233
Well, yeah, I think there's one
from batch 17 left. Uh...

234
Batch 16.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

235
Okay, Joey.
Honey, you're doing really good.

236
I just need you
to step to the portside.

237
Remember how we
talked about the portside?

238
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?

239
No.

240
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

241
Why not just say left?

242
Okay, go to the left.

243
Ahem, the left.

244
- Huh?
- Just sit over there!

245
Okay! Okay!
You're yelling again. See that?

246
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

247
You know what?

248
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
a beer on the portside.

249
See what I did there? Ha, ha.

250
We're luffing a little.
Will you tighten up the Cunningham?

251
Whoa, you just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

252
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

253
Oh, when we did that was when that bird
was overhead with the fish in his mouth.

254
- Did you see it? It was gross.
- No! I did not see the bird.

255
I did not see the fish! I did not see the
piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

256
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

257
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

258
That's it! You're yelling,
and I don't see you taking your top off.

259
I quit!

260
- What do you mean? You can't quit.
- Why not?

261
Because you're not finished!
I won't have it. Greens do not quit.

262
Greens?

263
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

264
Oh, my God. Wait.

265
Did I...? I just said,
"Greens don't quit," didn't I?

266
- Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?
- Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

267
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

268
Oh, God, Joey. Oh, I'm my father.

269
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

270
I've been trying so hard not to be
my mother, I did not see this coming.

271
Ugh, Joey.

272
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

273
- Ugh.
- Hey, I...

274
I did learn.

275
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

276
- No.
- Yeah. It's okay.

277
I know what a mainsail is. Huh?

278
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

279
- I know port is right.
- Left.

280
Damn it!

281
You know, I bet it would
make my grandma happy...

282
...to know that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

283
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

284
Looking up?

285
Oh, yeah, no, she was really nice to me
but she's in hell for sure.

286
Well, I've tried everything. I give up.

287
I'm not gonna be the mom
who makes the world's best cookies.

288
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

289
Kids love that, right?

290
Aw, Pheeb, isn't there any relative
that would have the recipe?

291
What about your sister?

292
Oh, no. I made a promise
to myself that the next time...

293
...I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

294
And that's not happening
until October 15, 2032.

295
That's the day you're gonna die? See.

296
Darn it, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Heh.

297
That's what you think.

298
What about friends of your grandmother?
Would they have the recipe?

299
You know, I may have relatives in France
who would know.

300
My grandmother said
she got the recipe...

301
...from her grandmother,
"Nestley Toulouse."

302
What was her name?

303
Nestley Toulouse.

304
Nestlé Toll House?

305
Ugh.

306
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

307
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

308
Yes!

309
Oh.

310
I cannot believe that I spent the last two
days trying to figure out that recipe.

311
It was in my cupboard the whole time!

312
I know! You see, it is stuff like this...

313
...which is why you're burning in hell!

314
So you understand.

315
I'd feel more comfortable
if you didn't tell people.

316
You know,
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

317
I understand completely.
There's nothing more horrifying...

318
...than embarrassing yourself
in front of your in-laws.

319
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

320
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

321
- I told him I was a lawyer.
- Heh.

322
- What'd you do when they found out?
- They never did.

323
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

324
Shall we?

325
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

326
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

327
...your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

328
Yep, yep.

329
Hey, why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

330
We're not sailing.

331
- Just pull on it.
- All right.

332
- Hey!
- Eh?

333
Sandwiches!

334
- What else?
- Ha, ha.

335
Here you go.

336
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

337
- What are you doing?
- Oops. Sorry.

338
Don't hold it like that.
You're letting all the good stuff fall out.

339
- Oh. Oops.
- Careful!

340
You're wasting good pastrami!

341
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!

﻿1
We learned one thing, C.H.E.E.S.E:

2
Cheerleaders and high explosives
don't mix.

3
You can say that again, Mac.

4
I couldn't have done it alone.
You're a genius.

5
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get
my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?

6
What did you guys think?

7
- Hey, the phone.
- I got it. I got it.

8
Hello.

9
- Hold on. Joey, it's your mom.
- It's Mommy.

10
- Aw...
- That's nice.

11
Ma, so what did you think?

12
Well...

13
...that was, um, okay.

14
It wasn't the best.

15
That was one
of the worst things ever...

16
...and not just on TV.

17
- What should we say?
- The lighting was okay.

18
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

19
I have costumes.

20
That means I'm stuck with:

21
"So we were watching you in there,
and you were sitting right here. Whoa."

22
- What about you?
- I don't know.

23
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, I... No.

24
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

25
- And say nothing?
- Uh-huh, yeah, that's right.

26
Wow, my folks really liked it.

27
What did you guys think?

28
It wasn't that good.

29
Do you think that your favorite animal
says much about you?

30
You mean behind my back?

31
Oh, you'll never believe
what happened to me today.

32
- I am sitting in my office...
- You guys!

33
Guess what my agent just said?

34
I'm in the middle of a story here.

35
Sorry, you finish.

36
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who walks in.

37
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

38
That's great.

39
- Joey.
- You weren't finished?

40
Yeah, "Guess who walks
into my office" is my story.

41
Ralph Lauren walked into my office.

42
Uh, if you're starting another story,
at least let me finish mine.

43
It's the same story.

44
Uh, wow, it's really long.

45
Ralph just came in to tell me
that he's so happy with my work...

46
...that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for Polo retail.

47
Aw...

48
- Still get a discount on wedding gowns?
- Yeah.

49
I'm so happy for you.

50
These really are
the days of our lives.

51
- What?
- Well, since you ask, ha, ha...

52
They want me back on
Days of our Lives.

53
- I get a big pay raise!
- Oh, hey!

54
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

55
Ooh...

56
I get to hire my own assistant.

57
Well... I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

58
You were at this job four years?

59
- That's right.
- This is all very impressive, Hilda.

60
Um, I just have
one last question for you, uh...

61
How did I do? Was this okay?

62
- What?
- I've never interviewed anyone.

63
I've never had anyone work for me.

64
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

65
No, dear, it's not.

66
And I know that.

67
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

68
- Nice to meet you.
- Good meeting you.

69
All right.

70
I'm a total pro.

71
- Hello.
- Wow. Huh, um...

72
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

73
I'm here about the assistant job.

74
Really?

75
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

76
Um, so what's...? What your name?

77
Tag Jones.

78
Uh-huh, go on.

79
That's it. That's my whole name.

80
That's your whole name.
Of course.

81
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

82
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience...

83
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses...

84
...two whole summers
at T.G.I. Friday's.

85
It's lame, I know.

86
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn...

87
Just hold on a second, please.

88
It's for Human Resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

89
Ha, ha, no, no, no.

90
- Hey.
- Shh, shh, shh.

91
- Anyway, I should go.
- Okay. Bye.

92
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, sweetie.

93
What was with all the whispering?

94
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

95
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

96
We love and respect
one another too much.

97
Aw...

98
But still, no, ha, ha.

99
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

100
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.

101
No, I can't do that.

102
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

103
- Okay.
- Okay.

104
So, ahem, Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

105
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

106
When I say restaurant, I mean a guy,
a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.

107
So Ross has about ten tacos.

108
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

109
Oh, my God. He threw up?

110
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

111
Oh, my God!

112
What was Phoebe's secret?

113
Um, Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

114
Oh.

115
That's it? I gave up
my Disneyland story for that?

116
Hm, that's right. You lose, sucker!

117
Please still marry me.

118
You have an assistant, right?

119
Did she call?

120
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

121
I don't know.
How do you decide who to hire?

122
I have it down to two people.

123
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

124
- And then, there's this guy.
- What about him?

125
I love him.

126
He's so pretty, I want to cry.

127
I don't know what to do.

128
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

129
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

130
Uh-huh.

131
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

132
Look how pretty.

133
Let me see.

134
Oh, my God.

135
Oh. But, no.

136
No. You can't... You can't hire him
because it's not professional.

137
Um, this is for me, yes?

138
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

139
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

140
Let me see.

141
Wo-ha-ow!

142
Don't show this to Monica.

143
And don't tell her
about the "Wo-ha-ow!"

144
- Ha, ha, hey, Joey.
- Hey, Terry.

145
- Nice to see you again.
- Been a while.

146
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

147
It's a different building.

148
So...

149
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

150
- When do I start?
- How about right now?

151
Okay.

152
Here are the audition scenes.

153
I thought you
were offering me the part.

154
Why?

155
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

156
Who looks more like me
than me, right?

157
Everybody has to audition. Ha, ha.

158
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

159
I got my own cable TV series...

160
...with a robot.

161
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

162
Well...

163
...I guess you think
you're pretty special, huh?

164
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building...

165
...making stars jump
through hoops for you, huh?

166
Well, you know what?

167
This is one star whose hoop...

168
This is the star the hoop...
This hoop...

169
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!

170
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

171
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

172
I noticed there were no plants
so I brought you your first.

173
There is a plant in your office.

174
Kind of.

175
Right.

176
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

177
Oh...

178
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

179
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

180
Well...

181
Gotcha.

182
Thanks again for meeting with me.

183
But I hired you.

184
- What?
- Yeah, you got the job.

185
- You're my new assistant.
- I am?

186
Yeah.

187
- I can't believe it.
- Ha, ha, me either.

188
First, I need you to go downstairs...

189
...find a woman named Hilda,
and tell her to go home.

190
- Hey.
- Hey, good, you're home.

191
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again."

192
Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.

193
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, tacos.

194
Ever since that story,
I've had such a craving.

195
Did you not understand the story?

196
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

197
Ah, nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

198
Hey, ooh, what's that? Dinner stuff?

199
- You making dinner?
- No.

200
Shh!

201
What's over there? Tacos?

202
No. No.

203
They're just, uh... They're...

204
They're ground beef smileys.

205
Uh, those are tacos.

206
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

207
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

208
Ha, ha.

209
What's so funny?

210
I'm not laughing.

211
You told her!

212
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

213
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

214
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

215
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

216
I should be
laying down papers for you.

217
- How could you?
- I had to. We're getting married.

218
Married couples can't keep secrets.

219
I... I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

220
Du... ude!

221
- What happened?
- Chandler and I are in a bar...

222
Did you not hear me say, "Du... ude"?

223
- And this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

224
So he goes over to her and, uh, after
a minute or two, I see them kissing.

225
You're thinking he's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls.

226
And you're right.
He's not the type...

227
...to go to bars
and make out with "girls."

228
You kissed a guy?

229
Oh, my God!

230
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

231
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...

232
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

233
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

234
- Hi.
- Hey.

235
How's Hilda working out?

236
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

237
She happy she got the job?

238
My new assistant is very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

239
Hello.

240
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

241
It's the producers at
Mac and C.H.E.E.S. E...

242
...if you'll excuse me for a minute.

243
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

244
Canceled?

245
Like, they're taking it off the air? Oh.

246
All right, I'll see you Monday.

247
We're not even shooting them anymore!

248
All right. Bye.

249
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

250
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, sorry, Joey.

251
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

252
You want to tell secrets?
Okay, in college...

253
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.

254
All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice
look-alike contest and won.

255
Ross came in fourth and cried!

256
Oh, my God!

257
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

258
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

259
Ha, ha.
Oh, I... I already told him everything.

260
You shush!

261
Once, she was sent to bed
without dinner...

262
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

263
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls.

264
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 13.

265
It's hard for some people!

266
Of course it is.

267
Wow.

268
- Chandler wore my underwear to work!
- Hey!

269
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

270
In college, Chandler got drunk...

271
...and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

272
That was you.

273
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

274
How could this happen to me?

275
Yesterday, I had two TV shows.
Today, I got nothing.

276
Wait a minute,
what happened to Days of our Lives?

277
Uh, well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

278
What happened?

279
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

280
Joey, why would you do that?

281
Because! They wanted me to audition.

282
You, an actor? That's madness!

283
Rachel Green's office.

284
Tag.

285
Hi, who was that?

286
Nobody. I was just practicing.

287
Really?

288
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel Green's office.

289
- You must be Hilda.
- Ahem.

290
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.

291
- Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?
Mm-hm.

292
- Phoebe.
Mm-hm.

293
- Great name.
- You like that?

294
- You should hear my phone number.
- Okay.

295
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

296
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you...

297
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

298
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

299
But, from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

300
- Yes.
- Hey, Rachel.

301
Hi.

302
Cute assistant. What's his story?

303
- Is he...?
- Gay? Yeah.

304
Hey, Terry.

305
Joey Tribbiani.

306
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

307
- I gotta go, Joey.
- Wait, Terry! Look, uh...

308
I'm really sorry about before.

309
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

310
- Give me another chance.
- I can't.

311
Wait, Terry, please!

312
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

313
You have no idea
how much I need this.

314
Please, help me out.

315
For old times' sake.

316
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

317
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

318
Here he comes.

319
Good morning.

320
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

321
And cut.

322
I'm back, baby!

323
You know, in my defense, um...

324
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

325
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

326
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

327
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

328
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

329
You know when I said
married people...

330
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

331
- Yeah?
- That was stupid. Let's not do that.

332
Oh.

333
Absolutely.

334
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

335
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah, definitely.

336
Okay, ha, ha.

337
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna hang out with people...

338
...who don't know
the Space Mountain story.

339
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

340
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

341
Hi.

342
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

343
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

344
...by guys.

345
- Really?
- Yeah.

346
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

347
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

348
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

349
Why is that?

350
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

351
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

352
- Okay.
- Okay.

353
- Well...
- Yeah.

354
...I'd love to ask out
your friend Phoebe.

355
Yeah, she's gay.

﻿1
Hey.

2
- What's the matter?
- Someone on the subway licked my neck!

3
- Licked my neck!
- Whoa! Willy's still alive.

4
- What are you doing?
- My mom called.

5
They're gonna run our engagement
announcement in the paper.

6
- We're looking for a good picture.
- Ooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.

7
Not true. There are great pictures of us.

8
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this...

9
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

10
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

11
Oh, here's a great one.

12
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

13
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

14
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines, like:

15
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

16
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I should warn you.

17
I'm not going. I'm going.

18
Dude, that reverse lay-up. Ugh!

19
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

20
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

21
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees."

23
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

24
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

25
- I thought that guy was married.
- He is, but he's getting divorced.

26
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
It's not a club.

28
If this guy's going through a divorce,
is it a good idea to go out with him?

29
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.

30
They have that that on the napkins
at the club.

31
- Oh, I gotta get back to work.
- You don't have to be back for a half-hour.

32
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch. Heh.

33
Ugh, I could just spread him
on a cracker.

34
If you have a crush on this guy,
why would you hire him?

35
- You know you can't date him, right?
- Oh, no, I know that.

36
Although we made a joke
that we spend so much time together...

37
...he should call me his "work-wife."

38
Soon he'll be able to call you
"that lady he knew that got fired."

39
I'm not gonna get fired,
because I'm not gonna act on it.

40
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

41
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

42
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

43
Dude, that's so sad.

44
- I could put a basketball court in the back.
- Heh.

45
Could I play?

46
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

47
- I just did them.
- Oh, well, drop and give me 10 more. Heh.

48
What?

49
I had a drink with lunch. Did those, um...?

50
- Did those cost reports come in?
- Yeah, I filled them out last night.

51
Oh, great. Could you make me 4 copies?

52
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

53
Huh.

54
Ah.

55
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi. Hi, Melissa. What's up?

56
I'm just about to, um, go out to the store.

57
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

58
You know, like dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

59
- Um, what's up?
- Is Tag here?

60
- No. Why?
- Oh, I was gonna talk to him...

61
...about doing something tonight.
- Really?

62
You got a little crush
on Tag there, do you?

63
Well, we've been flirting back and forth...

64
...but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more than that.

65
Okay, whoa, whoa. Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

66
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

67
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

68
All right, back to work.

69
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

70
Yeah, Melissa, I don't want to be known
as the, uh, office bitch...

71
...but I will call your supervisor.

72
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

73
Now, Chandler,
you want to give us a smile?

74
Okay.

75
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

76
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

77
- I do?
- Yeah.

78
All right, maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else. Let's try, um...

79
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

80
Or not.

81
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

82
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.

83
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure. Um...

84
Here.

85
Great.

86
You got anything
that's not Ralph Lauren?

87
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

88
I guess this'll be fine.

89
- Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

90
How would you feel about
taking out my assistant Tag?

91
- I'll pay.
- Heh.

92
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

93
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

94
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

95
Joey, just... He's new in town
and he doesn't have any guy friends.

96
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

97
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

98
- Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
- Uh-huh.

99
I know. Let's try a look...

100
...of far-off wonderment.

101
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

102
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

103
This picture's supposed to say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...

104
...not "Local woman
saves drowning moron."

105
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, don't laugh at him.

106
He's my drowning moron.

107
- Aw.
- That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!

108
I like this one.

109
It seems to say, "I love you
and that's why I have to kill you."

110
Can't all be bad.

111
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

112
Oh, there it is.

113
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

114
Why did you ever sleep with me?

115
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

116
- I'm having a really good time.
- Me too.

117
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

118
Oh!

119
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

120
Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...

121
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

122
Yeah, I...

123
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

124
Heh, I know that it's lame,
but I got these tickets from my boss...

125
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

126
- Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
- No, it's...

127
My ex-wife Whitney is out there.

128
I cannot deal with her now.
That woman is crazy.

129
Okay, I know. Hold on.

130
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

131
Yeah. Um, that's Whitney,
Kyle's ex-wife out there.

132
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

133
What? No.

134
Okay, but I have two tickets
to the ballroom-dance finals.

135
I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh...

136
All right, I'll do it.

137
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

138
Aah!

139
Hi, Ginger.

140
I want my key back.

141
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

142
Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.

143
I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.

144
All right. I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

145
Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome.
We'll, uh, talk about it later.

146
- Okay.
- Heh.

147
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

148
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep. Ooh.

149
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

150
Sorry, can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

151
...uh, who, by the way,
did not spend the night?

152
- Sure.
- Okay. Eh, heh...

153
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

154
- Watching ballroom dancing?
- Yes.

155
That's where we realized
we are both super cool people.

156
Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

157
- Like what?
- Like she's really mean.

158
And she's overly critical and... And... No.

159
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

160
Okay.

161
And she uses sex as a weapon.

162
Fine. Thank you for warning me.

163
At breakfast, I'll be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons.

164
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

165
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

166
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

167
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

168
No, listen to me, she is crazy!

169
Uh, your door isn't soundproof.

170
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

171
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

172
Hey, so did you have fun with,
uh, Joey last night?

173
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

174
Aw, that's nice.

175
Then we went to this bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

176
Women? You mean, like old women?

177
Kind of old, like 30.

178
- Oh.
- I never used to be able...

179
...to just talk to girls in bars...

180
...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers
last night.

181
That's great.

182
Oh, man. So Joey must have
really taught you some stuff.

183
- A little.
- Yeah.

184
How you doing?

185
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

186
Now pretend I have a camera.

187
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

188
All right. You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

189
Borrow money from me?

190
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

191
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

192
Then I look up.

193
See? All right, now you try.

194
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

195
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

196
- I had a doughnut.
- Oh.

197
- Hi.
- Hey.

198
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

199
Yeah, that guy's all right.

200
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

201
- What?
- You know, all the women.

202
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

203
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

204
I'm right here.

205
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

206
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women...

207
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him, blah!

208
But it bothers me, all right?

209
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

210
I got a great partner to pick up
girls with. Finally!

211
I'm still right here.

212
All right, will you talk to him...

213
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

214
What?

215
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

216
And I will get over it.

217
It's not like I love him. It's just physical.

218
I get these crushes all the time.
Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.

219
I know. Monica told me.

220
Did you have a crush on me
when you first met me?

221
Yeah, sure.

222
Can you people not see me?

223
So will you talk to him?

224
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.

225
One.

226
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

227
Hey. You wanted to talk to me?

228
I don't know.
You, uh, got something for me?

229
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.

230
Ten. Okay.

231
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

232
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

233
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

234
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.

235
So he gave me an antihistamine.

236
- What?
- Yeah.

237
Then I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

238
Brooklyn is far.

239
What were you thinking?

240
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

241
Okay, see. Look down.

242
Look down.

243
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

244
- Hi.
- Hi.

245
So how are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

246
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

247
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

248
...before she painted that room.

249
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

250
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

251
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

252
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

253
...but maybe that's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

254
You think he's emotionally unavailable?

255
I think he can be.

256
Maybe he wouldn't be...

257
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

258
Well excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

259
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.

260
I knew you were gonna
throw that in my face!

261
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

262
What more do you want?

263
We want the last six years back!

264
So do we! So do we!

265
I'm sorry you had to see that.

266
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

267
Hey, so, uh, what'd you do last night?

268
- Went out with Joey.
- Oh, yeah?

269
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

270
- No, we had a really good talk.
- Oh.

271
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

272
Wow, I did not see that coming.

273
It's just not really who I am.

274
No, I've always been happier when...

275
Why am I telling you this?

276
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do. I do.

277
Go on. You were saying,
"I'm happier when I'm..."

278
When I'm in a relationship.

279
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

280
Yeah. Someone I can spoil, you know.

281
- Sp... Spoil?
- Uh-huh.

282
- Let me ask you something.
- Uh-huh?

283
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

284
I'm starting to.

285
If that person's in your life,
you should do something about it?

286
Yes. Hell, yes.

287
- All right, then, it's settled.
- Okay.

288
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

289
What?

290
Hello?

291
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.

292
Um, yeah.

293
Yeah.

294
My God!

295
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

296
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

297
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

298
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

299
Oh, he knows. Heh.

300
For the most part.

301
Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.

302
We kind of need to talk.

303
- Both of you together?
- What's up?

304
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

305
...and we got to reminiscing.

306
We talked most of the night...

307
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

308
...is because there are still
feelings there.

309
So...

310
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

311
We're gonna give it another try.

312
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

313
I'm gonna work on that.

314
Oh, right, because you're so
capable of change.

315
You know, he hums when he pees.

316
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

317
We're so sorry.

318
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

319
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

320
Yeah, we're gonna go.

321
I'm sorry.

322
Agh.

323
Pheebs, you were right about her.

324
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

325
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

326
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

327
- We're better off without them.
- Heh.

328
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

329
- Divorced men's club.
- Potato, "potato."

330
Hey, guys, check it out.

331
- My mom sent me the paper.
- Ooh, let's see it. Yay.

332
- Oh, yeah, that looks good.
- You make a very attractive couple.

333
- Yeah, we look great together.
- We really do.

334
Okay.

335
Imagine what our kids would look like.

336
You know, we don't have to imagine.

337
I'm marrying her.

338
We'll just see.

﻿1
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
I hope it's you.

5
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

6
First of all, I love you both so much.

7
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
...where we trade off being maid of honor.

10
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

11
Hypothetically.

12
Still.

13
If Phoebe were mine,
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
We all get to do it and no one gets upset.

15
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So who's yours?

16
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

18
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
I'd like to make a toast.

20
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

22
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

23
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.

24
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

25
Huh.

26
Good luck!

27
Oh, and good luck to you too!

28
What a nice lady.

29
Yeah!

30
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

31
Let's make it a double feature?

32
What else did you rent?

33
Die Hard 2.

34
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

35
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

36
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

37
It would be cool to see it again!

38
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

39
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

40
Is everything okay?

41
Yeah, I just got plans.

42
Well, John McClane had plans.

43
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

44
...and starts calling everybody "bitch."

45
What are you talking about, bitch?

46
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

47
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

48
Really?

49
Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just...

50
Wait a minute.

51
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

52
Oh.

53
- Well, if that's what you want.
- Oh!

54
No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.

55
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

56
Because this one is now.

57
And it's two of our best friends.

58
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

59
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

60
You wouldn't.

61
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

62
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

63
I know you've done it at least twice.

64
- Yeah, but, Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

65
I guess that was it.

66
Okay.

67
Okay. Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

68
Oh, thank you so much!

69
Yay.

70
I'm gonna marry someone good.

71
Oh, I know.

72
- Better than Chandler.
- Pfft.

73
- What happened?
- I don't know.

74
We fell asleep. That is all.

75
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

76
All right, well, I'd better go.

77
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

78
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

79
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

80
- So, uh...
- Uh...

81
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

82
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

83
This woman overheard
that I was marrying you...

84
...and she wished me good luck.

85
That's sweet.

86
No, it was more like a "good luck."

87
So, what did this woman look like?

88
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

89
Any chance you were looking into
a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

90
Was it someone you dated in college?

91
No, I only dated two girls in college...

92
...both blond, both not attractive.

93
Let me check this out.

94
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

95
Okay, uh, is that her?

96
Oh, my God, yes!

97
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

98
Did you break up with her?

99
No, we're still together.

100
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

101
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

102
...and she'd gotten really fa... Ahh.

103
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

104
I said fa... Ahh.

105
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

106
Yeah. Yeah.

107
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

108
Apparently she does.

109
You know what they say,
"Elephants never forget."

110
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

111
Hey, what's going on?

112
Phoebe is gonna be
Monica's maid of honor.

113
Hey. Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

114
You have been maid of honor before?

115
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

116
That's it. I am maid of honor.

117
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

118
Because I cared enough to lie.

119
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

120
We could have an audition.

121
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

122
- What are you talking about?
- When I want a job...

123
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

124
...they give me the part.

125
Okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

126
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

127
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

128
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

129
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

130
Hi!

131
Ross, sweetie.

132
Hey there, handsome thing.

133
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

134
Hey.

135
Just brought back your videos.

136
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

137
No. No, we don't.

138
Yes, we do.

139
Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.

140
I don't know what you're talking about.

141
Come on, admit it.

142
That was the best nap you ever had.

143
I've had better.

144
Okay. When?

145
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

146
- Ah!
- I said it, okay?

147
But it's over, Joey!

148
I want to do it again.

149
We can't do it again.

150
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

151
Fine.

152
You want a drink?

153
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

154
Chandler.

155
I just figured out who you are.

156
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

157
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

158
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

159
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

160
Do you know why?

161
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

162
No, but because he thought
I was too fa... Ahh.

163
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

164
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

165
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

166
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

167
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

168
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

169
This is how it's gonna work.

170
We'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

171
You'll be scored on a scale of one to 10.

172
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

173
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

174
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

175
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

176
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

177
I don't want to marry Chandler.

178
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

179
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

180
This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.

181
Look, Monica...

182
...getting cold feet is very common.

183
It's just because of all the anticipation.

184
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

185
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

186
You don't get to keep the gifts.

187
Very good,
drawing on your own experience.

188
Very good.

189
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

190
Thank you, judges.

191
- Kiss-ass.
- Oh.

192
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

193
We're now in the ceremony.

194
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

195
...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.

196
What do you do? Go!

197
When Monica was a little girl...

198
...I remember that...

199
Ow!

200
- Very good!
- Oh.

201
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

202
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

203
Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs?

204
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

205
We haven't even prepared...

206
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Um...

207
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

208
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it. Um, um...

209
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

210
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

211
...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.

212
Oh.

213
Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...

214
I've known them separately and together.

215
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are truly in the presence of love.

216
So I would like to raise my glass...

217
...to Monica and Chandler...

218
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

219
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

220
Wow.

221
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

222
Oh, thanks.

223
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

224
Okay.

225
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

226
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

227
...while we were showering together, naked.

228
And she's back in the game!

229
Julie. Hi.

230
Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.

231
Hello, Skidmark.

232
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

233
It's pretty clear.

234
I owe you a long-overdue apology.

235
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because you were overweight.

236
That's why you broke up with me?

237
You didn't know that?

238
Well, I guess my work here is done.

239
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

240
You should be proud.

241
And I'd also like to say,
in this competition, there are no losers.

242
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

243
Really? I won?

244
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

245
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

246
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

247
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

248
Heads. Oh!

249
What? The coins have finally forgiven me!

250
You know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

251
...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

252
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

253
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

254
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

256
Why would I care about that?

257
No reason. I'm just saying that...

258
...that's where I'll be.

259
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

260
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

261
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

262
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

263
All right, I have to ask.

264
What?

265
Will you break up with me if I get fat again?

266
What?

267
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

268
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

269
In one year?

270
My God, what did she eat? Her family?

271
That's not the point.

272
I know it was a stupid reason
to break up with someone, but I was 15.

273
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

274
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

275
You called me fat.

276
Wait a minute.

277
- That was totally different.
- How?

278
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

279
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

280
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

281
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

282
This is one of the things
that I can apologize for later.

283
What I mean is, you're Monica.

284
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

285
Keep going.

286
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

287
...and I will still love you.

288
Even if I shrink down to 2 inches tall?

289
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

290
I love you.

291
Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.

292
Hi, Pheebs.

293
- Hi.
- Hi.

294
I just want to apologize.

295
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

296
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

297
- Oh, you mean today.
- Yeah.

298
Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.

299
And I was thinking about it.

300
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

301
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

302
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

303
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

304
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

305
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

306
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

307
She made me carry her train...

308
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

309
Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.

310
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

311
- Oh.
- Something. And...

312
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

313
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

314
This stuff is great.

315
I forgot this was in here.

316
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

317
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

318
And it's blue.

319
Yeah.

320
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

321
You do?

322
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

323
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

324
It's fine. I mean, this is something...

325
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

326
No, I was 10. I just developed early.

327
Man alive!

328
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

329
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

330
Oh, that's great!

331
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

332
I have really specific ideas.

333
We should meet four times a week.

334
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

335
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

336
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

337
She's gonna be yours.

338
Great nap.

339
It really was.

340
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

341
God!

342
Excuse me.

﻿1
- Morning.
- Hi.

2
How was your date?

3
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

4
- Aah!
- My God. Sorry about that.

5
Okay, really good.

6
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
You're going to leave her with me?

8
Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.

9
Can you do me a favor?

10
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
What, are you kidding?

12
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.

14
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
That's a lot to remember.

16
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
Honest.

19
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
He'd make extras and leave them for me.

21
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
Fine.

23
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

28
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
Would you like some pancakes?

30
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

31
The hot chicks?

32
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

33
...you know, for fun.

34
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

35
My doctoral dissertation.

36
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

37
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

38
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

39
What is that?

40
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

41
We're so sorry.

42
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

43
She sent the chicken back again?

44
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

45
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

46
Send the colonel in.

47
Oh, my God!

48
Lucky bastard.

49
- Janice.
- How are you...

50
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

51
I'm fine.

52
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

53
Oh, uh...

54
So who's the lucky guy?

55
Oh, my God.

56
I am so sorry, sweetie.

57
Are you okay?

58
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

59
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

60
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

61
Eh.

62
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

63
Name's Clark.

64
She also invited herself to our wedding.

65
Clark too.

66
You said no, right?

67
Huh?

68
You said no, right?

69
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

70
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

71
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

72
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

73
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

74
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

75
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

76
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

77
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

78
You know what? It'll be okay.

79
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

80
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

81
See how easy that was?

82
So you would have just lied?

83
Yes.

84
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

85
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

86
Hey, what's up?

87
- Hey.
- Hey.

88
Hey, who's your friend?

89
Hey!

90
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

91
You're still here.

92
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

93
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

94
And then there's you guys.

95
Well, listen, I better get going.

96
- Today was great. Thanks.
- I know.

97
Okay.

98
And Joey, last night was fun.

99
Yeah. I'll call you.

100
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

101
- And call me.
- Okay.

102
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

103
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

104
The system kind of broke down, huh?

105
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

106
And we got to talking, and I...

107
We want you to marry her.

108
What?

109
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

110
Who do you think brought her here?

111
Cupid.

112
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

113
Man, do you know what guys want.

114
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

115
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

116
My beers?!

117
Look, she's a very nice girl.

118
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

119
You always say that.

120
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

121
I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.

122
- Whatever.
- Fine.

123
Hey, don't start judging me.

124
You're in love with your assistant.

125
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

126
Phoebe!

127
Secret affair.

128
People are doing it in front of my book.

129
I'm sorry?

130
My doctoral dissertation is in the library
at school. I went to see it.

131
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

132
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

133
At your school...

134
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

135
Yeah, there was.

136
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

137
Yes, there was.

138
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

139
Hold on a second.

140
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

141
Oh, for crying out loud!

142
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

143
I'd like to see the previews.

144
The candy.

145
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

146
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

147
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

148
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

149
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

150
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

151
Oh, no.

152
What party?

153
A birthday party.

154
Whose birthday party?

155
Alison's birthday party.

156
Oh. And how old is Alison?

157
Thirty-two.

158
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

159
Look how that worked out.

160
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

161
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

162
Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.

163
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

164
No, no, no.

165
Can I speak to someone in charge?

166
How can I help?

167
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

168
...in the paleontology section?

169
I wrote a book that's up there.

170
And instead of reading it, people are...

171
Well, they're rolling around in front of it.

172
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

173
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

174
I can't help you.

175
Well, fine.

176
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

177
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

178
Don't you follow me.

179
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

181
We had the best time.

182
Yay!

183
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

184
This was much better than the first date.

185
It was awkward. We were both nervous.

186
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

187
And we have so much in common.

188
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

189
Not an issue now, but if we had kids...

190
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

191
Oh, my Joey.

192
- Please don't get married before I do.
- Oh.

193
Oh!

194
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

195
He may still show up.

196
What are you, stupid?

197
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

198
Let's go on to happier things.

199
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding?

200
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

201
It's going to be a small ceremony.

202
Tiny.

203
We're not even sure why we're having it.

204
It's actually going to be just family.

205
Oh, wait.

206
You two think of me as family?

207
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

208
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

209
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

210
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the Series?

211
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

212
I love arguing with her.

213
- Be right back.
- Okay.

214
How's it going with Joey?

215
Oh, okay.

216
Okay?

217
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

218
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

219
...but I just don't see this having a future.

220
What?

221
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

222
Did you just change your mind?

223
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

224
I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.

225
Didn't you sleep together?

226
Yeah.

227
Tramp.

228
Does Joey have any idea?

229
I don't think he does. You know what?

230
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

231
...in a serious relationship.

232
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

233
Yeah, that'd be great.

234
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

235
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

236
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

237
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

238
Hey, thank you so much.

239
Wow.

240
I guess it wasn't Cupid
that brought her here.

241
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

242
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

243
We were just looking around.

244
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

245
What exactly were you looking for?

246
Perhaps...

247
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...

248
...on the Smilodon californicus?

249
- Uh...
- Uh! Uh!

250
Get out of here!

251
Meeting someone?

252
Or are you just here to brush up...

253
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

254
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

255
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

256
I'm sorry. Who are you?

257
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

258
Ross Geller?
Why do I know that name? It's a...

259
Wait.

260
Did you write this?

261
Yes.

262
You're the person
who checked out my book?

263
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

264
You're so young.

265
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

266
I am very, very sorry.

267
- Hey.
- Hey.

268
Hi.

269
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

270
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

271
Seventy-thirty, but still.

272
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.

273
Really? She said she wants to go?

274
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky,
because she's busy at work.

275
- Oh.
- Oh.

276
Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?

277
Um...

278
I got the feeling from her...

279
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

280
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

281
She said she's kind of a loner.

282
Oh.

283
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

284
I'm a loner too, right?

285
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

286
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

287
No.

288
No, don't do that. Just...

289
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

290
Joey?

291
Yeah?

292
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

293
What are we gonna do?

294
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

295
Chandler?

296
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

297
Janice, what are you doing here?

298
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

299
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

300
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

301
Just I really feel like I need
to be with family.

302
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

303
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

304
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

305
- You have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

306
We'll just let her stay.

307
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

308
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

309
I never stop thinking about it.

310
Hey, you guys?

311
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

312
Janice, I'm sorry...

313
...but you can't stay here tonight.

314
Why not?

315
Honestly?

316
Our apartment is a hotbed...

317
...for electromagnetic activity.

318
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

319
...you have not.

320
I'm gonna need a comforter.

321
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

322
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

323
Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.

324
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

325
Why?

326
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

327
He does?

328
Say again?

329
That's right. That's right.

330
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

331
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

332
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

333
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

334
...but you can.

335
Oh, my God.

336
I understand. I am so sorry.

337
I'll go.

338
Goodbye, Monica.

339
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

340
Chandler.

341
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

342
I've got this section covered.

343
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

344
Okay, see you later.

345
I just wanted to show Monica your book.

﻿1
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Shh.

2
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
No, we're playing this game
I learned at work.

4
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
What? That's, like, insanely easy.

6
No, it's harder than it sounds.
You always forget at least one.

7
Or in some cases, 14.

8
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing
against other people...

9
...so technically, I didn't lose.

10
You forgot 14 states?

11
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.

12
Oh, okay, time's up.

13
All right, I got 48.

14
Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?

15
Oh, I got tired of naming states,
so I decided to list the types of celery.

16
And I have one, regular celery.

17
Okay, so Rachel's got 48
and Phoebe has the lead in...

18
...vegetables. Joey?

19
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

20
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

21
Hey, how is New England not a state?

22
Huh? They have a sports team.

23
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
There you go.

25
How come we have
one extra place setting?

26
- Because you invited your assistant.
- Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

27
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

28
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

29
I made him his own individual
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

30
Oh, well, I was going to,
but then I figured, you know...

31
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

32
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

33
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.

34
Regular celery.

35
Oh, I already have that.

36
Done, with time to spare.

37
- Ooh, this may be a new world's record.
- You know, I hate to lecture you guys...

38
...but it's kind of disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

39
...and Joey, can't name all the states.

40
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

41
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.

42
- What? That's impossible.
Forty-six.

43
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

44
I'm out of oven space.
I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.

45
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

46
I am only one man.

47
- Okay, time is up.
- Give me another minute.

48
Ross, if you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?

49
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

50
This is crazy. I can do this.

51
All right, uh, I bet I can get
all 50, uh, before dinner.

52
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

53
You're on.

54
All right, don't look at my list, because
there's a lot on there that you don't have.

55
Hey, did you guys know
your oven doesn't work?

56
But the drawer full of takeout menus
is okay, right?

57
- Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
- Shh.

58
Chandler, give me a hand.

59
Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any
maps or the globe in your apartment.

60
Don't worry, Chandler.
It's not a globe of the United States.

61
Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out
and take a walk.

62
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

63
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

64
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

65
Yes, I knit this.

66
I'm very good.

67
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here more often?

68
I don't know.
Maybe because it smells weird.

69
It's like old pumpkins or something.

70
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

71
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

72
We left Joey alone with the food.

73
Yep, yep, I knew it.

74
There he is...

75
...feeding stuffing to a dog.

76
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

77
Phoebe, why is there a dog
in our apartment?

78
I'm sorry, who's this?

79
Phoebe, there's a dog
sitting on my couch.

80
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.

81
- No, there's no dog here.
- There is.

82
He's black and white and shaggy.

83
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking Rachel's hand.

84
Oh, my God. Where are you?

85
I'll be right there.

86
They're here already?
How are they doing this?

87
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

88
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend
Thanksgiving with you was still good.

89
Well, sure. Come in.

90
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

91
We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.

92
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

93
Ohio, thank you.

94
Huh. Where's the dog?

95
What dog? There's no dog here.

96
Yeah, that dog left.

97
Phoebe.

98
Phoebe, open up.

99
There's no dog in here.

100
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

101
No, that's just me coughing.

102
Oh, good. There you are.

103
Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

104
What is it doing here?

105
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

106
Wait.

107
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

108
May I please stay
with you nice people?

109
Oh, I wish he could stay here,
but Chandler's allergic.

110
Extremely allergic, okay?

111
If I am anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

112
...my throat will just close up.

113
That's odd, because this dog's
been living here for the past three days.

114
Really?

115
If the dog has been here that long...

116
...and you haven't had a reaction,
maybe you're not allergic to this dog.

117
Well, it still has to go, right?

118
Why?

119
- Okay, it's, um...
- Don't do it.

120
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

121
Okay? It's time.

122
Okay, I hate dogs.

123
- What?
- That's crazy. Why?

124
Told you.

125
They are needy...

126
...they are jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

127
...and that scares me a little bit.

128
You're right. They are scary. Aah!

129
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

130
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs?
I mean, not even puppies?

131
Is there a puppy here?

132
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

133
Look, Chandler, I told you.
Never tell anyone about this dog thing.

134
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

135
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold.

136
Okay, it's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

137
Hurts my teeth.

138
I don't wanna say this.
I don't want you guys to hate me...

139
...but, uh, I don't think I can be
around that dog anymore, okay?

140
So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.

141
Oh, my God.

142
How can I not get this?

143
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

144
Twelve fifty.

145
Damn, I forgot you were here.

146
All right.
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

147
We'll be back in a minute.

148
Oh, wait, before you go,
can I ask a question?

149
Um, when a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

150
...what is an appropriate amount of time
to wait before you make a move?

151
Oh, I'd say about a month.

152
- Really? I'd say three to four.
- Half-hour.

153
Interesting.

154
When it's your assistant,
I would say never.

155
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

156
Right? Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

157
Huh. A "moo" point?

158
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

159
It just doesn't matter.

160
It's "moo."

161
Have I been living with him for too long,
or did that all just make sense?

162
Please don't listen to Joey.
Okay? Would you look at him?

163
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

164
He's spending Thanksgiving
with strangers.

165
What he needs right now
is for you to be his friend.

166
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

167
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

168
No one ever listens to me.

169
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

170
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
How you holding up?

172
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

173
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

174
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

175
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

176
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

177
- Hmm.
- It's weird.

178
I always used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

179
That all that was just a given.
Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?

180
Do you ever have that feeling?

181
No.

182
Yeah.

183
All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.

184
But, you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

185
Why?

186
Because it has to.

187
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

188
- Hey, thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

189
Hug it out.

190
All right, he likes you back.

191
Huh? Told you you should go for it.

192
What?

193
Street noise drown any of that out?

194
No? All right, I'll see you later.
Ha, ha. Okay.

195
What did Joey say? I like you back?

196
Uh, yeah... You know, well, see, he...

197
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

198
And... And you were hugging me...

199
...so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.

200
Wait a minute,
that doesn't make any sense.

201
No?

202
All right, here's the truth. Ahem.

203
Joey said what he said because, um...

204
...I'm attracted to you.

205
- Wow.
- Yeah, I admit it.

206
I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know
that's crazy because we work together...

207
...and nothing could ever happen.

208
And the last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

209
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

210
Which is why it would be really great
if you said something right about now.

211
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

212
- What?
- Right there. That's my car.

213
- Hey!
- Okay, that's gonna take a minute.

214
Do you have anything else
you wanna get off your chest?

215
I can't believe this.

216
Wait, we still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

217
Oh, look, there they go. Okay.

218
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

219
Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.

220
Stop it. Stop.

221
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

222
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
She said "Monica."

223
Oh, I can't leave her.

224
If you want, we could sneak the dog
back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

225
That's not gonna work.

226
I had that dog there for three days
and Chandler had no idea.

227
He's not so smart.

228
Hey. I didn't know either.

229
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

230
Yeah, I knew. Heh.

231
Where's Chandler?

232
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

233
How did you know?

234
Hey, what's she doing back here?

235
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

236
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I, uh, laid out the states geographically.

237
No, no, we don't have time for this.

238
We have to keep Chandler
away from my room.

239
Yeah, but, look what I...

240
See, this is exactly
what we do not have time for.

241
- Where's Monica?
- Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

242
Why not?

243
Monica's crying.

244
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

245
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

246
No, she doesn't want to see you
right now.

247
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

248
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?

249
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

250
And, um, one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

251
So Monica and her friend... Phyllis...

252
...take away the dog, and that was
the last time we ever saw him.

253
Don't you see? This is just like that...

254
...only with a few details changed.

255
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

256
Bring on the food.

257
- What's the matter?
- Monica's all upset...

258
...because I sent Klunkers away.

259
So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.

260
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that. I could... I could do...

261
What if it...? What if it attacks me?

262
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

263
And that doesn't scare you?

264
Ross, you need some help?

265
From you?

266
Yes, please.

267
First of all, Utah?

268
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

269
I hate America.

270
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

271
- Hey. Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

272
Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

273
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

274
I know that I freaked him out.

275
If you said it like that,
you probably did, yeah.

276
Hey, is Chandler here?

277
Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.

278
Okay, well, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

279
- Hi.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

280
He went over to Ross'
to bring the dog back here.

281
Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.

282
You think?

283
Hi, honey.

284
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

285
- What? Why would...?
- Shh. Wait and see.

286
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

287
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to
bring back Klunkers, you know, for you...

288
...and, ahem, I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

289
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

290
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

291
I couldn't find him...

292
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

293
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

294
We have good news. Look who's back.

295
Hi.

296
Klunkers. Oh, my God.

297
- That's right. She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

298
It is so good to see you.

299
Yeah, she came all the way back
from Ross' building.

300
Oh, the things she must've seen.

301
Then she climbed up the fire escape...

302
...and she tapped on the window
with her teeny little paw...

303
...and we ran to let her in.

304
I went too far, didn't I?

305
When should I have stopped?

306
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

307
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states.

308
Now, there are no more.

309
Now, I think I should be able
to eat something.

310
It's up to you.

311
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

312
I gotta go down to the police station
and look at mug shots.

313
- Thanks for having me over, you guys.
- Tag, you're going? Uh...

314
We didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.

315
So where did you say you're from again?

316
- Colorado.
- Ah, what good are you?

317
Look, um, I think we should talk about
what happened on the terrace.

318
- Okay.
- Uh...

319
I never should've said what I said.

320
You know what?
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

321
We work together, so nothing could really
ever happen between us.

322
What I would love is just to go to work
on Monday and never talk about this again.

323
Okay? Big day, Monday. Lots to do.

324
So we okay?

325
Um, I'm not.

326
- Oh, God, I knew it. I freaked you out.
- No, you didn't.

327
The only thing that freaked me out
was you saying...

328
...that nothing could happen between us.

329
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

331
Okay, well, that's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

332
Delaware.

333
Delaware.

334
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

335
You got it.

336
You got Nevada twice.

337
- I know.
- Yeah.

﻿1
I'm ready.

2
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

3
Okay, let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

4
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

5
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

6
There you go, there you go.

7
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting.

8
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

9
It was my sixth birthday.
My dad took me to the park...

10
...and I got on it and... it bent.
- Yeah.

11
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

12
Well, we didn't have a lot of money.

13
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

14
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handle grips...

15
...and a bell,
and this big, white wicker basket...

16
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

17
That sounds like my first bike.

18
My dad gave me his old one.

19
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

20
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

21
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

22
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

23
That is so unfair.

24
Not really, I got to drag him around too.

25
Hey, what are you guys doing?

26
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.

27
I'm sorry, who?

28
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.

29
When the neighbors walk by,
they can all take a piece.

30
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

31
There's, uh, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

32
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

33
...and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

34
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

35
We can learn their names
and get to know our neighbors.

36
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?

37
Good morning.

38
- Ah, somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

39
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

40
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

41
Come on, it's not a big deal.

42
We stayed up all night
coming up with a plan...

43
...so that us dating will not be a problem.

44
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

45
We... We are not...

46
...going to let it...

47
...be a problem.

48
Wow. It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

49
Oh, well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

50
Did you two?

51
Oh, Monica, you know I don't
sleep with guys on the first date.

52
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore.

53
Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

54
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

55
Wait, wait.

56
Did you see that?

57
That mail guy had no idea there was
something going on between us.

58
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

59
I'll remember to put that
in your evaluation.

60
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now...

61
...and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation.

62
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

63
- Are you serious?
- No, I've just always wanted to do that.

64
Can you help me clean this up?

65
The basket is totally empty.
My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.

66
Well, either that or, uh...

67
Joey.

68
Yeah?

69
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.

70
But by the time I got to it
there was only a couple pieces left.

71
Yeah. They've been coming by all day.
They love it.

72
They love my candy?

73
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

74
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a huge chunk of it.

75
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

76
Mine stole my newspaper.

77
It's like a crime wave.

78
Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?

79
- Sure.
- Yeah.

80
Ever since you, uh,
told me that story about that bike...

81
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

82
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

83
Oh, my God, Ross.

84
- You like it?
- I love it.

85
- Yeah?
- Oh. Oh, God...

86
- And I love you.
- Ah.

87
Not that way.

88
- But the bike got you a lot closer.
- Oh.

89
Well, uh, take it downstairs.

90
You know, give it a test drive.

91
Okay. Oh, my God.

92
My first bike.

93
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

94
You're welcome.

95
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

96
Am not.

97
Who is that?

98
Don't worry, I'm brave.
I am brave. I... I am brave.

99
No, no, no, no, no.

100
Can you tell me who is there, please?

101
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

102
- Hi.
- Hi.

103
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

104
My roommate says that they taste
like little drops of heaven.

105
Oh, please. Heh.

106
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

107
Four a.m.

108
So can I get some candy?

109
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

110
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

111
Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
first thing in the morning.

112
Well, okay, I'll swing by later.

113
- You live in this building?
- Mm-hm.

114
Mm. Seems like I would have
remembered you.

115
Mm. Night, Gar.

116
So did you read your evaluation yet?

117
No, it was marked "confidential."

118
I just sent it down to human resources.

119
Okay, please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

120
A joke they would appreciate?

121
I'm thinking no.

122
- What did you say?
- Um, I said that you were a good kisser...

123
...and, uh, that I liked
your teeny, tiny tushy.

124
No, not my tushy.

125
Well, it gets worse.

126
When asked if you take initiative,
I wrote:

127
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

128
And under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

129
And then, uh...
And then I drew a little smiley face.

130
And then a small pornographic sketch.

131
Ross, that is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

132
When I heard the story, I almost cried.

133
Almost cried, huh?

134
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

135
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

136
Those two had only each other.

137
Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?

138
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street the other day.

139
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

140
Yeah, I saw her this morning
walking it by the park.

141
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike?
Both times?

142
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi.

143
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.

144
Pheebs, you, uh... You do know
how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.

145
Of course.

146
Can we see you ride it?

147
Okay.

148
See?

149
This is why I told you
never get involved with your assistant.

150
And there's no such thing as keeping
secrets when it comes to having affairs.

151
Did you hear that, Chandler?

152
No such thing.

153
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

154
Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
Maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.

155
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

156
...and good worker.

157
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.

158
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

159
Might it have looked
a little something like this?

160
Oh, my God, Joey.

161
- What is the matter with you?
- God.

162
I tell you, this little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

163
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours,
but I really need candy.

164
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

165
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

166
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

167
Out-of-towners, huh? Heh.
What did you tell them?

168
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

169
Well, some people have been saying it's
"little drops of heaven," but whatever.

170
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

171
Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

172
All right, I'll do it just this once.

173
- But you can't tell anybody.
- Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.

174
Yeah, that's her.

175
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

176
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

177
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

178
But they like it.

179
You mean they like you.

180
Maybe.

181
Is that why you became a chef,
so that people would like you?

182
Heh. You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

183
Okay, now, just remember
everything I taught you and you'll be fine.

184
Okay? Here we go.

185
Ready, set...

186
Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.

187
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

188
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair.

189
Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay?
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

190
Why? Why do I have to learn?

191
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

192
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

193
"You ride this bike or I'll...

194
I'll shoot you."

195
Okay. I would ring the bell
to distract him...

196
...and then I would knock the gun out
of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.

197
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

198
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

199
You won't let go?

200
- No.
- You swear?

201
I swear.

202
- Okay.
- Come on.

203
- Here we go. All right? All right?
- All right.

204
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

205
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

206
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Whee! Hey!

207
Oh, oh!

208
Oh, no.

209
You swore.

210
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked.

211
It's a legitimate learning technique.

212
Wow.

213
Hey.

214
There's, uh, some people outside
asking about candy.

215
They're just gonna have to wait,
aren't they? I only got two hands.

216
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

217
I don't need nobody messing
with the system.

218
By the way, the week before your wedding,
you may not see a lot of me.

219
Oh, hello, liar.

220
Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.

221
I could've been killed, I hope you know.

222
I know, I know.

223
But can we please try it again?

224
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

225
Well, I would love to...

226
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

227
- Phoebe.
- What?

228
What the hell?

229
All right, you know what?

230
If you are not going to learn
how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...

231
...I'm just gonna have to take it back.
- What? Why?

232
Because. Because it's...

233
It'd be like you having this guitar...

234
...and never playing it.

235
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

236
And this bike wants to be ridden.

237
And if you don't ride it...

238
...you're killing its spirit.

239
The bike...

240
...is dying.

241
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

242
Great.

243
You're making the bike very happy.

244
Okay, Ross.

245
Please don't die.

246
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back
before they see it.

247
We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10, so no problem.

248
But his assistant, Betty, comes in early
to eat her breakfast at her desk.

249
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

250
Which is why I believe I can lure her away
with these chocolates.

251
Now, while I distract her,
you go in the office.

252
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

253
Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?

254
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

255
Okay, great.

256
Abort the plan. Abort the plan.

257
Uh, actually,
I'd like to speak to both of you.

258
Okay.

259
Uh, well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?

260
Um, no, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

261
So I read your evaluation of Tag.

262
Or, uh, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

263
Is something going on with you two?

264
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

265
I mean, what would happen exactly?

266
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

267
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

268
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

269
- Well...
- Uh, Mr. Zelner...

270
...I'm the one
who filled in that evaluation.

271
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
I thought it would be funny.

273
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

274
Yes.

275
I have a weird sense of humor.

276
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

277
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

278
And what is this drawing?
I can't figure out what this is.

279
You're looking at it upside down...
You know what? It doesn't matter.

280
Hey, it's not like I don't have
a sense of humor, huh?

281
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick
every now and then.

282
But there's a time and a place, huh?

283
Unless you, uh,
have a limerick right now.

284
No? Okay.
Well, uh, you've got my fax number.

285
I can't believe you did that.
That was really sweet.

286
- Ah, don't worry about it.
- No, you could've lost your job.

287
Are you kidding me?
With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.

288
Thank you, you're great.

289
- You know what?
- What?

290
I feel great.

291
In fact...

292
What?

293
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

294
I'm sorry.

295
There it is.

296
What is going on?

297
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy.

298
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

299
Joey.

300
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

301
Waiting to get candy.

302
Get in here.

303
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

304
Merry Christmas.

305
Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just
need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.

306
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.

307
What is the matter with you people?

308
This woman was trying to do
a nice thing for you.

309
She was making candy so she could
try to get to know all of you...

310
...and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

311
Am I right?

312
Candy Lady?

313
No, not "Candy Lady."

314
If we know it, can we have candy?

315
All right, you know what?

316
Forget it. All of you, forget it.
You've ruined it.

317
Go home. You've ruined it.
You've ruined it.

318
That's all wrong. You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it.

319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
Did you smoke?

321
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

322
Uh, are you okay?

323
I'm fine now, but it was
really scary there for a while.

324
Someone slipped a threatening note
under the door.

325
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.

326
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike.

327
I never thought I'd be able to do that.
Thank you, Ross.

328
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

329
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

330
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.

﻿1
Great. Great.
Just give me a sec to change film.

2
Okay. I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I am so excited for you.

3
- Why? What's going on?
- Monica's pregnant.

4
Oh, my God!
Is that why you guys had to get married?

5
- Guys, I'm not pregnant!
- Ah, slow swimmers?

6
What? What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?

7
- You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
- No.

8
I'll be right back.

9
Now why don't we get a shot
of Monica and the bloody soldier?

10
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change
before the party.

11
I can't.
I don't have any other clothes.

12
Find some. Please! Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."

13
Then why don't we see the bride
and the groom, and the bridesmaids?

14
Hey, Mon? Why did you tell
the guys that you weren't pregnant?

15
Because I'm not.

16
We found your test in the trash.
If you're not pregnant...

17
...it's because I am.

18
What are you talking about?

19
Yes. Ahem. I am with child.

20
And I didn't wanna say anything
because it's your day.

21
- I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
- So you told people I was pregnant?

22
Does this look like a conversation
I wanna remember?

23
- Who's the father?
- Yeah.

24
I can't say.

25
- Why?
- Why not?

26
I can't say because he's famous.

27
Oh, my God, who is it?

28
Come on, you have to tell us.

29
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin.

30
James Brolin is the father
of my baby.

31
As in, Barbra Streisand's husband,
James Brolin?

32
What? He never said that to me.

33
Monica, if you can step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

34
How about just the bridesmaids?

35
I am the groom.
I was told it was kind of a big deal.

36
- It is.
- Yeah.

37
- Oh, my God!
- Thank you for doing that.

38
I just can't deal
with this just quite yet.

39
- So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?
- You did, I just didn't disagree.

40
- Sneaky!
- Yeah.

41
- Smile, ladies!
- Ohh.

42
- By the way, James Brolin?
- Ugh. I know.

43
I could only think of two names:
Him and Ed Begley Jr. And then...

44
I remembered he's gay, so...

45
- Ed Begley Jr. Is not gay.
- Really?

46
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

47
...to introduce to you
for the first time:

48
Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing!

49
- Before we go out there, I got a present for you.
- I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

50
- No.
- No?

51
- I've been taking dancing lessons.
- What?

52
Yeah, for the last 6 weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.

53
Aww. That is so sweet!

54
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?

55
- Yes.
- Okay.

56
- What's the matter?
- These new shoes are all slippery.

57
- Are you going to be able to do this?
- Not well.

58
Well, the good news is
I don't think anyone's looking at us.

59
- So you ready to talk about it?
- No.

60
Now?

61
No.

62
Okay, we'll talk about something else.

63
- Thank you.
- Who's the father?

64
Uh. Look, honey,
I haven't told him yet...

65
...so until I do,
I don't think I should tell anybody else.

66
Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?

67
Ugh. Phoebe!

68
- Okay. I'm sorry, I'll stop.
- Okay.

69
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

70
- Oh, my God, it's Joey!
- Honey, stop it, okay?

71
I'm not going to tell you until I tell him.

72
Ah-ha! At least we know it's a him.

73
Oh, sweet lord.

74
I'm sorry, okay?

75
I went down to the gift shop,
and it was either this or a bathrobe.

76
Look, what's more important? The way
I'm dressed or me being with you today?

77
Honey, I'm not even going to pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey.

78
Hi.

79
I'm Ross. I don't believe we've met.
I'm Monica's older brother.

80
- Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
- Oh.

81
Hello, "Mona from her restaurant."

82
Mona. What a beautiful name.

83
You think so?
I always kind of hated it.

84
- Aw, come on! Mona Lisa?
- Uh-huh.

85
Mona...

86
...Klegglachen?

87
The famous botanist. Huh?

88
Oh, no.
She's... Well, she's dead now.

89
But supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.

90
- Really?
- Yeah.

91
- Well, see, I never knew about her.
- Linda Klegglachen...

92
So, what table are you at?

93
Oh, heh, me too.

94
Good. There will be someone
who likes my name.

95
Yes, there will.

96
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

97
And if it's all right with you,
I'm gonna take your place at table six.

98
Martin Klegglachen!

99
That's better. Just bend your arms a little more.
There you go. Look straight ahead.

100
Now this time I want you
to really put your ass into it.

101
Chandler, darling. Look, my date has finally
arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

102
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

103
Dennis is a dear old friend.
And a fantastic lover.

104
Bravo, Dennis,
thanks for pleasing my mother so.

105
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
I was stuck at auditions.

106
Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

107
Hi, I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.

108
- Dennis Phillips.
- Wow. I've admired your work for years.

109
You've done some amazing stuff.

110
Thank you.
Excuse me, I'll get myself a drink.

111
I'll be back in a moment.

112
Dennis Phillips! That's great!
How did you guys meet?

113
Well, you know, it's a funny story.

114
Funny "ha-ha,"
or funny "boom, uh-oh!"

115
Thank you very much. Now if everyone will
please take their seats, dinner will be served.

116
Hey.

117
- Uh, I thought you were at table six.
- Uh, no. Nine.

118
Ohh. See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way...

119
...which was misleading.

120
Well... I'll... um...

121
Hello.

122
Chandler! Will you see if your mom can give
my résumé to Dennis Phillips?

123
Because if I can get into a Broadway show,
I would've done it all:

124
Film, television and theater.

125
The only thing left would be radio,
and that's just for ugly people.

126
- What size shoes do you wear?
- Uh, eleven. Eleven and a half.

127
Great. My shoes are giving me
a problem on the dance floor.

128
- Can I borrow the boots from your costume?
- I don't know where I left those, so...

129
- Those aren't eleven and a half.
- Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

130
All right, I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good! I'll show you!

131
- Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
- Let's not talk about that now.

132
- This is so huge.
- Sure, but as big as your wedding?

133
Of course not. Nothing is.

134
- Wow. Between me and you?
- Yeah.

135
In this day and age,
how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

136
Hey, sometimes you can do everything right,
wear what you're supposed to...

137
...and one of those little guys
just gets through.

138
- How?
- I don't know, maybe they have tools.

139
Well, I talked to her,
and she's definitely gonna have this baby.

140
She's gonna raise it on her own.

141
Well, maybe that's really brave.

142
I just hope she realizes
how hard it's gonna be.

143
Maybe she hasn't really
thought it through that much.

144
There's a lot to think about.

145
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?

146
Does she realize she's not gonna have a date
again for the next 18 years?

147
I don't know.

148
Are you okay?

149
Mm-hm.

150
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

151
- Champagne?
- Oh, yes. Thank you very much. Whew.

152
That's actually how the French drink it.

153
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover,
James Brolin.

154
- Really?
- Yes.

155
And apparently,
he is married to some singer.

156
But he said he'd leave her for me.
So I said, "Are you sure?"

157
- And James Brolin said...
- Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

158
What?

159
Why bother?

160
How do you feel?

161
I don't know how I feel.
This is all happening so fast.

162
I have to make all these decisions
that I don't want to make.

163
Mm! Oh!
Someone take this away from me!

164
- Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
- What?

165
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took the test three times.

166
Yes. Maybe it's a false-positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

167
How many ways are there
to do that?

168
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're 100 percent sure.

169
I'll take it again at home.

170
You gotta take it now,
as a present to me.

171
Okay. Thank you.

172
- I'll run out and get you one.
- Aw, you girls are so great.

173
Wait a minute. Who's the father?

174
- She won't tell us.
- Come on! It's my wedding.

175
That could be my present.

176
- Hey! I just gave you peeing on a stick.
- See, this is why you register.

177
It was the chair again, okay?
I'm not doing it!

178
It was... Look, I don't.
You know what?

179
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

181
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

182
- Dr. Geller?
- I wasn't farting!

183
Uh, a little game from our table.

184
- Yes?
- Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

185
Oh. Um...

186
Maybe later.
I'm about to dance with this lady.

187
Okay.

188
Ooooh.

189
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

190
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

191
Ohh. Yes, I am.

192
In fact, why don't we try it my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

193
- Sure.
- Yeah? Hop on.

194
- Is the pretty lady looking?
- Uh-huh.

195
Keep dancing.

196
And the world will never know.

197
- Hey! Did you talk to Dennis?
- Yes. I told him how talented you were.

198
- I told him all about Days of our Lives.
- No, you don't tell a Broadway guy that!

199
- Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
- But you're not just a soap actor.

200
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

201
Hey.

202
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Miranda.

203
- Melinda.
- All right.

204
- How cute was that?
- Oh! Were you watching?

205
- Can I go next?
- Uh...

206
Of course you can. Hop on.

207
Okay. But I get to hop on after her.

208
- I am so gonna score!
- What?

209
I like your bow.

210
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler...

211
...the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

212
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

213
I was like, "Why, God? How can you
take them away from me?!"

214
But then I thought back over our
memories together.

215
Some happy memories.

216
Then there were some sad memories.

217
I'm sorry.

218
And some scared memories.
Whoa!

219
Huh?

220
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

221
Their friend who can speak
in many dialects...

222
...has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

223
Oh... To the happy couple.

224
- That was nice.
- Can we do it again?

225
No, no.

226
- So is it my turn?
- I'm next.

227
Oh!

228
- That's okay, you can dance with her first.
- Are you sure?

229
Okay.

230
- So what's your name?
- Gert.

231
That's pretty.

232
Come on.

233
Whoa! Whoa!

234
What are you doing, Gert?

235
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls did it.

236
Okay.

237
Hop on, Gert.

238
- Why aren't you moving your feet?
- I'm trying.

239
Faster! You're not going fast enough!

240
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

241
So did you happen to catch my toast
up there?

242
Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?

243
Well, I like to think
there was something for everyone.

244
- I know you're casting for this new show.
- Look, Joey, I don't think you're right for it.

245
See, that's where you're wrong.
Whatever it is, I can do it.

246
- And if you didn't see it up there, just try me.
- It's an all-Chinese cast.

247
Can you be Chinese?

248
- I'm not proud of this, but...
- Oh, my God. No, please! Don't!

249
- Ready to get back on the dance floor?
- Did it turn into sand?

250
- Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine.
- No, I won't.

251
Do you know why I took all those lessons?

252
For the first time, I didn't want you
to be embarrassed...

253
...to be seen on the dance floor
with some clumsy idiot.

254
Aww. Sweetie, you could never
embarrass me.

255
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.

256
But it doesn't matter. Right?

257
I married you.

258
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on!

259
- Just try not to move your feet at all.
- Oh.

260
There you go.

261
- Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Why?

262
You stole my moves.

263
- How much longer?
- Thirty seconds.

264
Thirty seconds. Okay.

265
Did I miss it?

266
Rachel, I want you to know...

267
...that if it's positive, we...

268
- I know. I know.
- You do? Okay.

269
It's time.

270
No!

271
- Go ahead, Rach.
- Oh, wait. You know what? I can't look at it.

272
I can't look at it.
Somebody else tell me.

273
- Okay.
- Okay.

274
It's negative.

275
- What?
- It's negative.

276
Oh.

277
Well, there you go.

278
Whew!

279
That is... That is really great, great news.

280
Because the whole...

281
...not being ready,
the financial aspects, all that...

282
This is so just the way
it was supposed to be.

283
Well then, great.

284
God. This is so stupid.

285
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

286
It's negative?

287
No, it's positive.

288
- What?
- It's not negative, it's positive.

289
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I lied before.

290
Oh!

291
Oh, my God!

292
- Now you know how you really feel about it.
- Oh! That's a risky little game.

293
Are you really gonna do this?

294
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby.

295
I'm gonna have a baby!

296
- With who?
- No, it's still not the time.

297
I just didn't see
the fast song coming.

298
Shh. Don't try to talk. We'll get you up to your
room, soak your feet. You'll be okay.

299
- Oh, thank you.
- That is so sweet!

300
- Yeah.
- No, I mean it.

301
There's so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

302
Tell me about it.

303
I feel like I'm holding down
the fort all by myself.

304
- It's Joey, right?
- Yeah.

305
Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one!

306
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night.

307
How small are your feet?

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey. So, what do you think?

2
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
Boots? Boots!

3
Yes! They're a little more than
I usually spend on boots. Um, or rent.

4
Oh, my God.

5
- I know.
- I'll miss being able to afford food.

6
I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
The saleswoman was like:

7
- "These are too expensive for you."
- She had a point.

8
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

9
- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing!
- They're mine!

10
- Too bad we'll have to return them.
- Return them? Shh! They're gonna hear you.

11
I'm not returning them.

12
I know they cost a lot,
but I'll wear them all the time. You'll see!

13
Besides, I love the compliments.

14
Have you ever had something
everyone wants?

15
- I have you.
- Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

16
That's right. I love you.

17
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

18
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

19
- He's talking to the baby.
- Oh! Okay.

20
Okay. When he said, "I can't wait
to hear your first words"...

21
...I thought, "There's a trick."

22
Okay, well I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

23
- Okay.
- All right.

24
Bye.

25
- Oh, hey, Rach. Um...
- Hi.

26
Can you do me a favor? My sister
knows you work at Ralph Lauren...

27
Forget it! No way.
I'm not sending more clothes to prison.

28
- It is a waste.
- No! Not her.

29
My youngest sister, Dina.
She's interested in fashion.

30
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

31
- I'll talk to my supervisor.
- No, no. She wants to talk to you.

32
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

33
- Would you meet with her?
- I'd love to. Have her come by.

34
Great. You'll love her. She's the smartest
of all the Tribbiani children.

35
- Yeah, you know the SATs?
- Yeah.

36
She took them.

37
Hey, Ross,
doesn't Ben go to Smithfield School?

38
Yeah. Why?

39
- Sting has a son that goes there.
- I know. He's in Ben's class.

40
You knew and never said anything?

41
With all the stupid
dinosaur stuff you tell us?

42
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

43
"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.

44
What are you reading? "A Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?"

45
It's New York Magazine, an article
about the best schools in the city.

46
- So how well do you know Sting?
- I haven't met him.

47
Uh-huh. That's too bad. I wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

48
I know! Why don't you meet him
and get tickets?

49
If you get two, I'll take you.

50
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

51
There you go. Ugh, you're so lucky.
You might meet Sting tomorrow.

52
That's why you have kids.

53
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

54
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

55
See? I'm getting a lot of use
out of them already.

56
They're very practical. You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants...

57
Wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn money to pay for them.

58
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- They hurt so much.

59
- What?
- The guy who made these...

60
...hates feet
and wants to see them die.

61
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

62
I can't. I spent so much on them, and
told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.

63
- I can't just give them away.
- Then get your money back, return them.

64
I can't do that either.

65
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

66
- Hey.
- Hey.

67
- Hey, I, uh, just picked up Ben from school.
- Oh.

68
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

69
I dropped him off at Carol's.

70
Anyway, I'm not gonna
get those tickets.

71
Oh, no. Why not?

72
Well, it turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

73
- How come?
- Apparently, Sting's son made fun...

74
...of the fact that Ben's moms
are "les-be-nims."

75
Wait! If they don't get along,
you should smooth things over.

76
- Make them be friends.
- You can't force kids to be friends.

77
Sure you can. Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

78
- Playpen? Ben's 7.
- Your kid is 7?

79
He's really small.

80
- Please! Please get the tickets.
- I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

81
- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
- What?

82
Ross can!

83
Look, Pheeb, I'm sorry...

84
Ross can!

85
Phoebe?

86
Ross can get me the tickets!

87
Here she is.
Future fashion superstar.

88
- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...
- My little sister, Dina!

89
- Right. Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

90
Thanks for meeting me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

91
This is exciting for her.

92
Well, I'll let you two fash...

93
...ists get down to business.

94
Okay. All right, Dina.

95
Let's talk about the different
areas of fashion...

96
...you could get involved in.

97
Let's see. There's design.
But you may need another degree for that.

98
Uh, there's sales, which is great.
You get to travel.

99
I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant.

100
And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

101
And there's marketing.

102
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

103
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

104
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing. I'm just... I just was yawning.

105
Don't forget my office
holiday party tonight.

106
We don't really have to go tonight,
do we?

107
Sweetie, I know that you don't like
my office parties.

108
- But you can wear your new boots.
- Ha, ha.

109
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

110
- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
- Why not?

111
I'm worried your bosses might see them
and think they pay you too much money.

112
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

113
Do you think I work at
a boot-pricing company?

114
Anyway, I picked an outfit,
and the boots don't go with it.

115
You said you paid all that money...

116
...because those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

117
Fine, if you want me to wear the boots,
I'll wear the boots.

118
In fact, I'll go in to my room now
and try the outfit on.

119
- Okay.
- Okay.

120
Ooh-wee! Ha, ha.

121
Christmas party in my boots!

122
Ha, ha, ow, ha, ha, ow.

123
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

124
It'll be okay.
He's been incredibly supportive of me.

125
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

126
- Thank you.
- Okay.

127
Hey! It's my fashion girls!

128
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you sit down?

129
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

130
Oh. What's going on? Is it Mom?

131
Is she sick? Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?

132
- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.
- Is that a sandwich?

133
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

134
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

135
Now. Give him the sandwich.
Give him the sandwich!

136
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

137
You have to have sex to get pregnant.

138
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

139
- What? Dina...
- Bub!

140
Sh...

141
I can't believe this! You're
the good one. You went to college.

142
Both years!

143
- Who did this to you?
- Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.

144
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

145
You got pregnant for "funny"?

146
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

147
- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!
- Why?

148
I can't look at you right now.

149
- Wow.
- I know.

150
Oh, there you are, Ben.

151
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

152
I heard you have a problem
with a boy in your class.

153
And so I thought
I'd just come down here...

154
...I'd sit you both down,
have a talk and make it all okay.

155
Now, um, the boy's name is Sting's son.

156
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

157
Now, Ben, sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside...

158
...but they have famous fathers.

159
I have to go.
My friend Doug is waiting for me.

160
Him you're friends with.

161
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

162
Yes. Yes you can.
I'm looking for Jack's parents.

163
- Are you with a student?
- Uh-huh. I'm with Ben.

164
- Are you one of Ben's mothers?
- I am one of Ben's mothers.

165
I'm a lesbian.

166
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

167
Heh, well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm the new teacher here.

168
- Oh.
- I've only met your partner, Carol.

169
- Ah! Okay, that would make me Susan.
- Heh.

170
Right. Are you looking
for Jack's parents to discuss...

171
...the problems he's having with Ben?
Yeah.

172
I think the parents should sit
down together and converse.

173
Yeah, let's do that!

174
That sounds good.
We should sit and talk.

175
Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

176
- How will I get in touch with them?
- Their number's on the contact sheet.

177
Uh-huh. Um, could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

178
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

179
- That wasn't bad.
- I didn't know there'd be dancing.

180
That was a fun surprise!

181
- I don't see any, uh, cabs. We should walk.
- No, we can't walk.

182
It's, like, 15 blocks to the subway.
Let's go.

183
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole cover?

184
- What's going on?
- I can't walk, okay? Okay?

185
- These boots were a huge mistake.
- What?

186
You were right.
I never should've bought them.

187
They're killing me, one toe at a time.

188
I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

189
It's oddly unsettling.

190
How are will gonna get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

191
- Hop on.
- Okay, wait. Give me a second.

192
Let me just get my boots off first.

193
Ow.

194
Oh, God.

195
Honey, I know you're in pain
right now, but I'm a little turned on.

196
Do you worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will slip out?

197
What college was that, Dina?

198
Oh, my God! Bobby?

199
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

200
- Joey, what are you doing?
- Just what needs to be done.

201
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
- Ugh, Joey, this is crazy.

202
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

203
- Where were we? Do you take this man...?
- No!

204
- Oh, you'll take him.
- No I won't!

205
- Hey, you don't get a say.
- Yes I do.

206
Ah, I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
Okay, you.

207
All right, Joey, that is enough!

208
Listen, as beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

209
They don't have a marriage license,
they don't have witnesses...

210
...and the groom only has on one shoe.

211
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

212
What am I supposed to do?

213
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and can make their own decisions.

214
No, they can't.
They're stupid enough to get knocked up!

215
Hey!

216
Contraceptives are not always
effective. Right?

217
- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
- Oh, come on, kids, a little help here.

218
Wow! This place is incredible!

219
Sting's pen. That he gave to Phoebe.

220
Come on, secret passageway.

221
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
- I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
- Uh-huh.

223
Why else would I be here?

224
- Why don't you sit down?
- Uh-huh.

225
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along.

226
- Yeah.
- I'm sure there are two sides to this.

227
But all I've heard is that Ben's
a bit of a "poo-poo head."

228
Um, I'm sorry.
Won't Jack's father be joining us?

229
I'm sorry, Jack's father's not available.

230
Mm-hm. Okay.

231
Well then could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

232
Oh, no, that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

233
Concert. Yeah.
Mm. That just put us in quite a pickle.

234
Because I'm very busy before
and after the concert...

235
...and he's obviously busy during.

236
So you and I should talk about
Jack and Ben now.

237
Unless... Unless, um...

238
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert...

239
...um, all the while
thinking about the children of course.

240
- Are you here for tickets?
- Ugh, thanks. Four would be great.

241
I'm not giving tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

242
Oh, then you're in luck.
Ben's not my son.

243
I've pressed a button
triggering an alarm.

244
- Any minute now, the police will be here.
- The Police? Here?

245
A reunion? Ooh!

246
Okay, 10 blocks down, five to go.

247
- Oh, wait! Stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

248
My boots in tan!
Get closer so I can see the price.

249
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

250
Okay, I think I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

251
- I don't have your boots.
- I don't either. Where are they?

252
Why don't you check
in one of my saddlebags...

253
...while I chew on a bale of hay?

254
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

255
Are you seriously
ever gonna wear the boots again?

256
Okay, I'll never wear them again.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

257
Know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

258
- Okay. All right. Unh.
- Okay.

259
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

260
Joey, because they're not
getting married...

261
...doesn't mean this is a disaster.

262
- Maybe they have a plan.
- Oh. Oh! Okay, let's hear their plan.

263
What's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

264
Well, I really have high hopes
for my band.

265
You were right. He is funny.

266
Wait! I bet when you told people
you wanted to act, they laughed at you.

267
Bobby, tell us a little
about your band.

268
It's just me and my pal, Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

269
Really?

270
Dina, if you're having a baby,
you should be married.

271
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

272
- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
- What are you gonna do?

273
You're gonna have the baby and raise it
by yourself, without a husband?

274
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

275
- Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
- No, no, it's different for you.

276
You're strong and together.

277
You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

278
- Excuse me?
- One pregnant woman at a time, please!

279
I just want you to be okay.

280
Forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

281
Maybe.

282
Yeah. So, uh, what kind of music
does Numbnuts...?

283
Ah, forget it! I can't!

284
Joey, I am scared to death
about this.

285
But I think I can do it.
I just need some help.

286
- And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
- You bet I am.

287
To answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

288
Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made this on her.

289
- Why can't you do that for me?
- Because!

290
Because you're my baby sister!

291
And you're my big brother.

292
I mean, you're my favorite guy
in the whole world.

293
I'm not even scared to tell Mom
and Dad. I was scared of telling you.

294
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

295
I can't stand the thought of
having this baby with you mad at me.

296
I want him to have his uncle.

297
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

298
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

299
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby is gonna be so loved.

300
- And not just by us.
- That's right.

301
- By his uncle too.
- And by you.

302
Okay, Bobby, come over here and let them
have a little moment, okay?

303
Come here!

304
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

305
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

306
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

307
Well, let's just say:

308
Ross can!

309
Ohh!

310
- Where are the seats?
- Middle balcony.

311
Would you say that that's
more than 50 yards away...

312
...from Sting, his wife,
or a member of his family?

313
- Yeah.
- Then that's not breaking the law!

314
I'm there!

﻿1
- Phoebe.
- Yeah?

2
Look at that guy by the window. Wow!

3
He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

4
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

5
Ugh, what is wrong with me lately?
It's, like, every guy I see.

6
Look at that guy, for example.

7
Normally that's not someone
that I would be attracted to.

8
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling...

9
...all I wanna do is rip off
his sweatpants and fanny pack.

10
Wait a second! This is about
the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

11
- Yeah.
- This is completely normal.

12
Around the fourth month,
your hormones go crazy.

13
- Really? So this happened to you?
- Absolutely, yeah.

14
And keep in mind, I was carrying triplets.

15
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

16
Wow, this explains so much.

17
Last weekend, I went from store
to store, sitting on Santas' laps.

18
Yeah, I remember trying to steal...

19
...a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield
from a Footlocker.

20
- Ugh.
- Yeah, ugh.

21
I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

22
Maybe she can give me
a pill or something.

23
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

24
- Hey.
- Hey.

25
- Hey.
- Hi.

26
Look, I got our pictures developed.

27
Oh, great. Joey, wanna check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

28
Oh, uh, ordinarily I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

29
Where are the pictures that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

30
Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.

31
Oh, my God. All he took
were pictures of my breasts!

32
I'm missing picture time?

33
You know, she has a face, Ross.

34
- Okay, here's a good one of us.
- Wow, that is a good one.

35
Wow, It looks like a holiday card...

36
...with the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow. Heh.

37
Every year I say I'll send cards
and I never do it.

38
Do you wanna send
this one out together?

39
Together? Like, to people?

40
Yeah, "Happy Holidays,
from Mona and Ross." it'll be cute. Okay?

41
Heh. Uh, okay.

42
- Oh, I gotta get to work. Call me later?
- Sure.

43
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

44
- Bye.
- Yeah.

45
Congratulations! You just got married!

46
I know. Can you believe that?

47
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

48
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

49
People who've been dating a few months
do not send out cards. Is she crazy?

50
Hey, hey, hey.
That's your wife you're talking about.

51
- Bing! Ho, and the Bingette!
- Ah, heh.

52
- Honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
- Yes. Hi.

53
So, good news, the divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

54
I didn't know you were getting
a divorce. I'm sorry.

55
Heh, sorry? Finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

56
- Hey! Congratulations to you guys.
- Heh. No leg-chewing for us.

57
Well, give it time.

58
So! The divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

59
How about we go out to dinner
tomorrow night?

60
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

61
Why can't I think of anything
we're doing?

62
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

63
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me...

64
...and I keep knocking them
out of the park! Ha-ha-ha.

65
Okay, see you tomorrow.

66
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

67
I cannot spend another evening
with that man.

68
Remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

69
- No.
- Because he wasn't invited.

70
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

71
Oh, yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

72
- Hi!
- Hey.

73
Hey, I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

74
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

75
Huh. Wow, this is great.

76
Now, do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

77
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet...

78
...but I guess it's okay
to say it to other people.

79
- How many did you want? I'm getting 100.
- A hundred? Ha-ha-ha.

80
Well, I, uh, guess I'll take, uh...

81
Mona?

82
Uh, I don't... I'm not sure
about the whole, uh, card thing.

83
Really? Why not?

84
Sending out a holiday card together?

85
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

86
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right. You're right.

87
- So can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

88
- Where are we?
- Huh?

89
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

90
Hmm.

91
I mean, I love spending time with you.
I hope we're moving forward.

92
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

93
Let's do the card!

94
- What?
- The card! I think we're there.

95
Okay, but I still think
we should have this conversation.

96
Really? I mean, even with the card?

97
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today. She was called to the hospital.

99
So Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

100
Okay. Can I ask you a question?

101
Was it me, or was the guy who
took my blood sample really cute? Heh.

102
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

103
- Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Schiff.
- Yes, you are.

104
So how's it going?

105
Oh, it's really good.
But enough about me! Come on. Heh.

106
Where are you from? What do you do?

107
- I'm a doctor.
- Right. I meant...

108
...you know, in your spare time.
Do you cook? Ski?

109
Or hang out with your wife
or girlfriend?

110
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend,
but I do ski.

111
I love to ski! How amazing is this?

112
- Are you experiencing any discomfort?
- No, I'm very comfortable.

113
- Any painful gas?
- No!

114
Ew, Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

115
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?

116
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

117
- Sorry, is there something going on here?
- Do you feel it too?

118
- Hi.
- Oh, hey. So...

119
...how did your doctor's appointment go?
- Well, let's see.

120
Uh, they gave me
"cute boy" doctor today.

121
In the middle of the exam
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

122
- Oh, my God!
- Why did you do that?

123
Okay, remember that problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?

124
Oh, yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase.

125
Oh, man. You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

126
You wish!

127
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.

128
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

129
Okay, even this is turning me on.

130
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

131
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with you and Mona?

132
You guys still together?

133
Oh, yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

134
You and Mona
are doing a holiday card together?

135
We're not just doing a card.

136
She also wants to have the conversation
about where the relationship is going.

137
Ugh, women.

138
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation, huh?

139
No self-respecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

140
Uh, Ross, you asked me that.

141
Hey, you were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

142
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them, really.

143
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture.

144
Something that says we're moving forward
without having to talk about it.

145
- Like asking her to move in with you?
- Wha...? Ha. Smaller than that.

146
- Making her a mix tape?
- Uh, bigger than that.

147
- Give her a key to your apartment.
- Whoa, hello. We were closer with the tape.

148
Have you said "I love you"?
Say, "I love you."

149
I don't... I don't think I'm quite there yet.

150
But, oh, I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

151
- No, we hate that.
- That is a slap in the face.

152
Oh, forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

153
I'll just say, "I like things the way
they are," and hope for the best.

154
What do you think, Rach?

155
I think if it was
a little colder in here...

156
...I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

157
Bing, we're all set for tonight. 8:00.

158
Oh, uh, as it turns out, we can't do it.
Monica has to work.

159
Oh. My ex-wife didn't work.

160
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

161
Now, fine. Tomorrow night, then.

162
Oh, uh, well,
tomorrow's no good for her, either.

163
Oh? Why not?

164
It's the semifinals...

165
...of her...

166
...bocce ball tournament.

167
- Ahem.
- What's going on, Bing?

168
Does, uh, your wife have a problem
with me, or something?

169
Well now you're just talking crazy.

170
Then why can't the three of us
go out together?

171
Because, uh, we split up.

172
Monica and I split up.

173
Hold me.

174
Good God, Bing.

175
Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

176
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

177
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

178
What would help me
through this tough time...

179
...is choking someone.
Can I choke you?

180
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

181
Here's the plan: Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!

182
Oh, no, Monica would freak.

183
But to hell with that bitch!

184
Here we go.

185
Ah, Mona, um...

186
...I think it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

187
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

188
Heh. Uh, we are so...

189
So, um...

190
...well, I really like you.

191
And I love, um, you know,
hanging out with you.

192
And I'm having a lot of fun.

193
Okay.

194
I mean, there's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

195
- It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
- Ha, ha.

196
So where is it going?

197
Ah.

198
That's the real question.

199
And the answer is...

200
...it's going somewhere...

201
...fun.

202
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

203
- Ha-ha-ha.
- But you're not getting any younger.

204
No, I mean, not you. Not you.
You are getting younger!

205
You look like you're getting younger
by the second. What's your secret?

206
I'm sorry, so, uh, where are we?

207
Well, to sum up:

208
We're having fun. You look young.

209
- Okay...
- But that's not enough.

210
So, heh, so...

211
...here's a key to my apartment.

212
- Really?
- Really.

213
- You don't think this is too fast?
- Mm-mm.

214
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

215
Not just a key,
I gave her the only key!

216
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship.

217
- Oh, Ross, how'd the conversation go?
- Great. I live on the street.

218
Where?

219
- Hey!
- Hi.

220
Okay, Monica, Rachel,
this is my friend Roger.

221
- Hi, Roger.
- Hi, Roger.

222
- Hi.
- So, um, I'm gonna get us some drinks.

223
- Okay.
- Could you help me?

224
Yeah, okay.

225
Um, he's here to have sex with you.

226
- What?
- You're welcome.

227
Phoebe, no!

228
It's okay. He's a virgin.

229
Rachel, um, I was talking to this guy...

230
...and I think he'll have sex with you.
- Okay...

231
- Yeah, okay. Let's leave these two alone.
- Aah!

232
No. I don't care
what my hormones are doing.

233
I'm not gonna just do it
with some random guy.

234
Fine. Then you tell Roger.
He was really looking forward to this.

235
Ooh, Bing, look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

236
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls, huh?

237
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

238
Bing, what's this?

239
It's a hand. It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.

240
No, it's a wedding ring.
You gotta get rid of it.

241
We're gonna go to the East River
and throw it in!

242
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah!

243
I did, and I felt a hell of a lot better!

244
If you whip it right,
you might hit a seagull in the head.

245
Okay. Oh, I'm gonna need
a bunch of extra keys.

246
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

247
Hey, Ross, what's going on?
You changing the lock?

248
No, heh.

249
That guy is.

250
I don't understand.

251
You give me a key to your apartment
and then change the lock?

252
- Uh...
- Good luck, buddy.

253
Um, I thought we were moving forward.

254
And now you're sending me
all these mixed signals.

255
What are you trying to tell me?

256
I'm trying to tell you...

257
...I made you a mix tape.

258
- What?
- I love you.

259
Oh! Aww!

260
Heh, oh.

261
And I love spending time with you.

262
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- From the tequila factory?

263
It was awful.

264
To get out of dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

265
So he took me to all these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.

266
And when I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

267
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

268
Know what the worst part was?

269
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.

270
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.

271
Please promise me
that you'll never leave me...

272
...that we'll grow old together,
and be with each other the rest of our lives.

273
I promise.

274
Hey, speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?

275
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.

276
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

277
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

278
- I'll call you back.
- Who was that?

279
- Just the pizza place.
- You hung up on the pizza place?

280
I don't hang up on your friends.

281
- Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.
- Oh. What's wrong?

282
- Oh, you really don't wanna hear about it.
- Then why did I ask?

283
Okay. It's just that
this is really embarrassing.

284
But lately with this pregnancy thing...

285
...I'm just finding myself...

286
How do I put this? Um...

287
Erotically charged.

288
Is that college talk for "horny"?

289
Yeah. So, you know,
I have all of these feelings...

290
...and I don't know
what to do about them.

291
Because I can't date
like a normal person.

292
Which is fine,
I don't need a relationship.

293
All I really want is one great night.
Just sex.

294
You know?
No strings attached. No relationship.

295
Just with someone I feel comfortable with
and who knows what he's doing.

296
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard...

297
...to find?

298
So how was your day?

299
Good. I, uh, saw a pretty big pigeon.

300
I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

301
Yeah, I gotta go to my room too.

302
- Okay, good night.
- Good night!

303
- I can't do it!
- I didn't ask you to!

304
- You're Rachel!
- You're Joey!

305
- You're my friend! Yeah.
- Right back at you.

306
Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

307
So bad! I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything.

308
I know!

309
- You wanna do it?
- No!

310
- Me neither, I'm just testing you!
- That's the end of this conversation!

311
- This conversation never happened.
- Never happened.

312
- Good night.
- Good night!

313
Get back in there!

314
Hi. Listen, ahem, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

315
It really wasn't right,
and I wanna make it up to you.

316
So, um, I brought you something...

317
...that I think you'll really enjoy. Okay.

318
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back. So...

319
I'm gonna go now.

320
I'm sorry, I thought I could do it,
and I can't.

﻿1
Hey, I got you a present!

2
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

3
I got it for your wedding, I ordered it
weeks ago and it finally got here!

4
Pheebs, you didn't have to get us
anything for our...

5
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it! Open it!

6
- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
- Oh, my God!

7
I didn't know where to put it so I left.

8
- We can put it in the guest bedroom.
- Yeah, okay.

9
- I kind of like it here.
- Do you really like it?

10
Are you kidding? I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

11
- This was, like, my second favorite game.
- What was your first?

12
- I don't really remember the name of it.
- Well, what did it do?

13
Well, you'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

14
A vending machine?

15
Hey, don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

16
Hey! I'm so glad you guys are here.

17
I've been dying to tell someone what
happened in the paleontology department.

18
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

19
Professor Newman, the head
of the department, is retiring, so...

20
- They made you head of the department!
- No, I get to teach his advanced class!

21
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

22
- Oh, hey, Rach, listen, um...
- Yeah.

23
I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

24
Uh, Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

25
Ooh. Great, thanks.

26
And then after, you could take her
to the Four Seasons for drinks.

27
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

28
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

29
You sure are naming a lot of ways
to postpone sex, I'll tell you.

30
Agh, I miss dating. Getting dressed up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

31
I'm not gonna be able to do that
for so long. And it's so much fun.

32
Not that sitting at home worrying about
giving birth to a 16-pound baby is not fun.

33
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out?

34
What? You don't want to go on
a date with a pregnant lady.

35
Yes, I do. We're gonna go out,
we're gonna have a good time.

36
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections...

37
...and giant baby heads stretching out...

38
Okay, I'll go with you. I'll go.

39
- It will be fun.
- All right. Okay.

40
No, no! Yes!

41
Aw, would you look at that, Monica?

42
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

43
Okay, I'm next.

44
No, don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

45
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

46
- Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game.
- Who cares? It's a stupid game.

47
Oh, you only think it's stupid
because you suck at it.

48
I don't suck. It sucks.

49
You suck.

50
If this game is gonna
cause problems between you...

51
...maybe I should keep it.
- No, I love it. It is a great present.

52
In fact, why don't you go home
and wait for the "Thank You" card?

53
- Why do you want to play so badly?
- Yeah, it's not like it spits out...

54
...a Clark Bar after every game.

55
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair. Come on. Out of the chair.

56
Phoebe!

57
Joey, could you get that?

58
Ugh, Joey...

59
What? I thought you were in your room.

60
No, I'm picking you up for our date.
These are for you.

61
Oh, lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

62
And a brownie.

63
Well, half a brownie.

64
Actually, it's just a bag.

65
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I was starting to feel faint, so...

66
Oh, man, this is so great!

67
I actually feel like
I'm going on a real date.

68
With a hint of morning sickness and I'm
wearing underwear that goes up to about...

69
...there.

70
Hey, come on. This is a real date. Uh...

71
So, nice place you got here.

72
Foosball, huh? Pizza box.

73
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

74
Actually, that's my roommate's.

75
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

76
But he's very protective of me...

77
...so you'd better watch yourself.
- Ah.

78
Hey, so, this roommate of yours,
is he good-looking?

79
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, yeah.

80
- Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
- Ha, ha.

81
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.

82
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

83
Which brings us back, of course,
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

84
That's it for today.

85
Oh, uh, does anyone know
where the Freeman Building is?

86
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.

87
What? That's across town.

88
I'm supposed to teach a seminar there
in 10 minutes.

89
Ooh, dude, that's not gonna happen.

90
Move it. Move it. Move it!

91
Hey! I'm the teacher!

92
Hello.

93
Sorry I'm a little late. Uh...

94
Whoa, a lot late.

95
Uh, well, let me start by,
uh, introducing myself.

96
I'm, uh, Professor Geller.

97
So to sum up...

98
...I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.

99
Now, the filet mignon,
what comes with that?

100
A side of steamed vegetables.

101
Mm.

102
Instead of the vegetables...

103
...is there any way that I could
substitute the, um...

104
...three-pound lobster?

105
You know what? Bring her both.

106
And I'll have the same.

107
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

108
Oh, I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

109
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no roommate stuff. We're on a date.

110
Okay. Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

111
Do you have any moves?

112
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for...

113
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

114
I knew it. Come on, tell me your moves.

115
Uh, all right. Um...

116
Well...

117
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

118
Oh, my God. And that works?

119
It does when you combine it with,
"This is embarrassing.

120
I just want to have a normal life."

121
- Aw, you poor little famous man.
- Mm-hm.

122
Oh, okay, how about this one?

123
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you...

124
...but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

125
Oh, my God! Ha.

126
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. I really almost did.

127
All right, so tell me one of your moves.

128
All right. Ahem.

129
So where'd you grow up?

130
That's your move?

131
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

132
- Come on, just answer the question.
- Ugh. Queens.

133
And so were you close to your parents?

134
- With my mom. Not so much my dad.
- Why not?

135
I don't know. I guess there's just
always been this distance.

136
I mean, we both try to pretend
it's not there, but it is.

137
Mm.

138
It's gotta be rough.

139
It is. Yeah, it's really tough.
You know, sometimes I think...

140
Wow!

141
- Nice move!
- Uh-huh.

142
- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
- Thank you.

143
Ha, ha. Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

144
- And now you're watching me walk away.
- Yes, I am! Again, so simple.

145
Hey.

146
- You're not gonna believe what I did today.
- Clearly wasn't showering or shaving.

147
I got good. I played this game all day,
and now I rule at it.

148
They should change the name
of it to "Ms. Chandler."

149
Although, I hope they don't.

150
You stayed home all day
and played Ms. Pac-Man...

151
...while I went off to work
like some chump?

152
Uh-huh. I got the top ten scores.
I erased Phoebe off the board. High-five!

153
What is the matter with your hand?

154
I been playing for eight hours.

155
It'll loosen up. Come on,
check out the scores.

156
And also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

157
- Chandler, why would you do that?
- Because it's awesome.

158
You think this is clever?

159
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

160
- This one's not dirty.
- It is when you put it together with that one.

161
Oh. Heh.

162
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

163
Ben's coming over here tomorrow.
This can't be there.

164
- He won't know what they mean.
- He's 7, not stupid.

165
- Have you talked to him lately?
- Look, I'm gonna unplug it.

166
No, no! I'll have nothing
to show for my day.

167
It'll be like I was at work.

168
No!

169
Hey, look! It's still there!

170
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip in it or something!

171
- You gotta beat your scores.
- With the claw?

172
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off the screen.

173
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

174
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

175
- I am not gonna answer that.
- Oh, come on. Just pick one.

176
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross...

177
...if you had to... If you had to,
who would you punch?

178
No one. They're my friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

179
Chandler?

180
Yeah, but I don't know why.

181
- I'm having a wonderful time!
- Me too.

182
Hey, Rach, can I just say...

183
...I think this is the best date I ever had.
- I know!

184
I've never laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

185
Yes. Joey, I think everybody saw
the wine come out of your nose.

186
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

187
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

188
Huh.

189
All right. Now don't judge me.

190
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but you live here.

191
I'm ripping into the swan.

192
Okay, well then, you don't judge me.

193
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from the brownie I had before.

194
Mm. Mm.

195
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

196
Uh, well, if I want the girl to kiss me...

197
...first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible.

198
How do you do it?

199
Now you can't tell anyone, but, uh...

200
...I put on shiny lip balm.

201
- Oh, my God.
- Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.

202
- Okay, all right, so now you go.
- No, I don't want to tell you.

203
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

204
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

205
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

206
- Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
- Ha, ha.

207
Okay. All right, stand up.

208
Well, when we're at the door...

209
...I lightly press my lips against his.

210
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

211
And then I make this sound:

212
Mmm.

213
I know it doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

214
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

215
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

216
- Mwah.
- Oh, yeah.

217
Me too.

218
You were 50 minutes late to the class?
Did you crawl there?

219
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

220
When did people stop understanding
"Get the hell out of my way"?

221
Why didn't you take a cab?

222
Ugh. Between the traffic and one-way
streets, it'd take me twice as long.

223
Besides, I teach the class three times
a week. Who am I, Rockefeller?

224
You're not gonna be able
to keep doing this.

225
I have to. If I don't,
they'll take the class away from me.

226
And I already put it
in my family newsletter.

227
- Your what?
- You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

228
Right. Wow.

229
Besides, I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

230
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

231
- Hey.
- Hi!

232
Hey, remember, um, last night
when we were talking about Cujo?

233
Oh, yeah, I can't believe you haven't
seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?

234
Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.

235
Have you ever tried to sit through
Citizen Kane?

236
Yeah, I know. It's really boring.

237
- But it's a big deal.
- Yeah.

238
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo sometime.

239
Well, yeah, all right.
Let's do it tonight.

240
- Don't you have that big date tonight?
- Oh, right.

241
- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

242
After our date last night,
did you feel a little weird?

243
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

244
I don't know.

245
I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.

246
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

247
- I was up sick all night.
- Yeah, me too. All night.

248
Really? How come
we didn't cross paths?

249
Yeah, well, that's because, uh...

250
...I stayed in my room.

251
Yeah, you don't want to look
in my hamper.

252
Okay, I got that.

253
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

254
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man...

255
Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?

256
Hey, you guys?

257
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

258
Oh, my God, your friends
have some unfortunate initials.

259
- They're all Chandler.
- Chandler sucks.

260
- He couldn't have gotten this good.
- I did.

261
- But it came at a price.
- Ugh.

262
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

263
Come on, by age 7,
kids have already seen orgies.

264
Was it just me?

265
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

266
Agh.

267
Okay, why don't we all, uh...

268
...open our books to page 23...

269
...where...

270
...where you will see a, uh...

271
...a bunch of, uh, red spots.

272
Okay, why don't, uh,
you all start to read, while I...

273
Hey, are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

274
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

275
Hey, can I ask you something?

276
Have you ever looked at someone
that you've known for a while...

277
...and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

278
You mean like from behind?

279
Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly it.

280
You know what?

281
One time I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

282
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

283
Ooh, yeah. So you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

284
- Totally! Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha.

285
- Would you excuse me for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

286
Eh.

287
- God, Phoebe! You're on fire!
- I know!

288
- You can do it!
- Don't touch me!

289
Don't touch her!

290
All right, go left! Go right! Go right!

291
I can't! I can't!

292
No! You son of a...

293
Phoebe!

294
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

295
Aah! God! Thank God you're home.

296
- I'm watching Cujo.
- Alone?

297
- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
- Did you get to the part...

298
...where they're in the car and Cujo's
throwing himself at the windshield?

299
No. No! Seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

300
What are you doing home?
What happened to your date?

301
Oh, uh, it didn't work out.

302
Want to watch
the rest of the movie with me?

303
Oh, uh, okay. Yeah.

304
I never thought I'd say this
about a movie...

305
...but I hope this dog dies.

306
What are you doing over there?
Come sit here. Protect me.

307
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

308
Okay.

309
- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
- All right, I know.

310
It's gonna be okay.

311
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

312
Ugh, seriously, how can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

313
Terrified.

314
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

315
Let us begin.

316
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

317
Here...

318
...and here.

319
Now, as for the hadrosaurus...

﻿1
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

2
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

3
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

4
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

5
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

6
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

7
Hi.

8
Are you...? Are you high?

9
I had the most amazing bath.

10
- Really? I don't like baths.
- You like them with me.

11
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

12
- Baths are so relaxing.
- Really? What do you do?

13
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

14
How dirty do you think I am?

15
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.

16
It'd take all your stress away.

17
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching
Road Rules. How stressed am I?

18
Hey, Chandler.
I really need to talk to you.

19
Oh, uh, yeah. Is this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

20
- Well, neither.
- Oh, my God, what's up?

21
I don't know. It's just...
Lately, I've been feeling...

22
Okay, here's what it is. Heh.

23
- I feel a lot better. Thanks.
- Wait a minute. Just come back.

24
Okay. You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

25
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

26
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what I mean?

27
Do you?

28
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.

29
- In London.
- Yeah.

30
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

31
This is a bad idea. Forget all about it.

32
This conversation, between you and me.

33
If that.

34
Hi. Oh, Ross, don't forget
that doctor's appointment.

35
- Right.
- To find out the sex of the baby?

36
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.

37
- Yep, healthy. And cute.
- And smart.

38
- Popular.
- With an aptitude for science.

39
Are you two talking about the same baby?

40
- Have you thought of names?
- Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

41
- Really? Me too.
- Me too.

42
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

43
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

44
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

45
- Rach, what were you thinking?
- Okay.

46
Um, I was thinking if it's a girl...

47
...how about Sandrene? It's French.
- Huh.

48
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

49
Hmm.

50
- Fine. What do you have?
- It's for a boy.

51
I know it's a little out there, but...

52
...Darwin.

53
Our child will be beaten in the schoolyard.

54
Yeah, by Sandrene.

55
You're saying that
because I said no to you.

56
I'm really, really not.

57
How about you each get five vetoes?

58
- All right.
- That sounds fair.

59
I don't think you'll need it.

60
If it's a girl, Rain.

61
- Veto.
- Why?

62
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

63
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

64
I know her!

65
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

66
- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
- Why do you hate our child?

67
- Fine, you go.
- Okay. James.

68
Huh.

69
- But only if it's a girl.
- Oh, veto.

70
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

71
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

72
- How about Dayton?
- Veto. Stewart.

73
Veto. Sawyer.

74
- Veto. Helen.
- Veto.

75
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

76
Hey.

77
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

78
Sex on the balcony?

79
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

80
- What?
- I drew you a bath.

81
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?

82
Try it for me. I used all my best stuff.

83
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

84
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

85
- This does butch it up a bit.
- I swear, you will love it.

86
If I do this, can we discuss balcony sex?

87
Absolutely.

88
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

89
Who can say where the road goes?

90
All right, this isn't bad.
I like the flowery smell.

91
Which is okay, because I've got my boat.

92
- So?
- Oh, my God.

93
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

94
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

95
I don't think you had
an open mind about Ruth.

96
Little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?

97
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

98
All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in the sex of the baby?

99
- No, we're not.
- You have it right there?

100
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

101
But if you don't wanna know...

102
- No, we wanna wait. Right?
- Right. Right.

103
Oh, I'll be right back.

104
I know it's really not my place...

105
...but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

106
So, which of these babies is the ugliest?

107
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

108
They're babies. They're all beautiful.

109
- Third one from the left?
- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

110
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you...? You're looking!

111
- I didn't!
- I saw you!

112
Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything.

113
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

114
- But I didn't...
- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

115
I couldn't, because I don't know!

116
I swear I didn't see anything!
It was just a momentary lapse.

117
"Momentary lapse."
Don't you have any self-control?

118
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

119
Hello?

120
Can you come in here?
There's something wrong.

121
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

122
- I'm in the bathtub.
- Oh.

123
- What's wrong?
- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.

124
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.

125
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile? Oh!

126
- What?
- Bath salts.

127
They're starting to effervesce.

128
It's different. It's interesting.

129
Let's talk about something else.

130
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

131
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

132
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

133
- I had the same conversation.
- What was he talking about?

134
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in Macbeth.

135
- That was a long night.
- What exactly did he say to you?

136
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

137
- Not to me.
- What'd he tell you?

138
He asked about you, me and London.

139
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

140
Okay. So you, me and London.

141
Looking at people differently.

142
Maybe he wants to do
what you and I did in London.

143
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

144
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

145
- He's looking at her differently.
- Phoebe is his friend.

146
That'd be breaking the rules.

147
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

148
- You guys?
- Um, just a minute!

149
- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
- You don't say anything.

150
Why would I? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?

151
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

152
- I won't let you say anything.
- Stay here.

153
Oh, God!

154
Oh. I brought back your iron.

155
You had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

156
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

157
- What?
- Nothing.

158
Okay.

159
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

160
Fine.

161
- It's a humdinger.
- Too bad you can't tell me.

162
Somebody likes you!

163
- Ugh. Is it Chandler?
- No!

164
- Then tell him to stop staring.
- It's Joey.

165
Really? Joey? You don't say.

166
- Would you be interested?
- I don't know, I don't know.

167
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

168
But, you know, on the other hand...

169
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

170
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

171
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

172
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

173
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

174
- Not Chandler. Just Joey.
- Sure.

175
- Hi.
- Hey.

176
You know what?
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

177
I'd consider naming our child that.

178
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me. Oh...

179
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

180
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

181
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

182
You did see. You know it's a boy!

183
I didn't see anything. I changed my mind.

184
I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...

185
...so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

186
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

187
I would... Sequoia!

188
- Veto.
- Fine.

189
Unless you anticipated that
I would figure all this out...

190
...and you know that it actually is a girl.

191
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

192
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

193
- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
- Not like this!

194
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

195
- Um, Joey, I know.
- What?

196
- I know.
- What?

197
- I know about your feelings.
- Oh, my God, you do?

198
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

199
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for them.

200
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

201
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

202
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

203
She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!

204
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.

205
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

206
I made a list of everything
I don't like about her.

207
- You wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

208
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

209
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

210
Joey, you're getting upset for nothing.

211
- This is probably just a crush.
- You think?

212
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

213
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

214
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

215
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

216
I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

217
- And I'm sure you've had them for us.
- Not really.

218
Throw me a bone here.

219
So I, uh... I called the doctor.

220
- Now we both know the sex of the baby.
- What?

221
That's right.
The student has become the master.

222
- Ross, I swear. I don't know.
- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

223
- A what?
- You really didn't know?

224
- We're having a girl?
- No.

225
- That's what you said.
- No.

226
- You said girl.
- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

227
I'm not! We're having a girl!

228
Sometimes I can't believe it's with
you, but still, we're having a girl!

229
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

230
Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.

231
- Permission to veto.
- Yes, please.

232
- Hey.
- Do I smell essential oils?

233
I'm gonna take a bath.
I was gonna get a magazine.

234
Okay.

235
What do you think you're doing?

236
Leaving my troubles behind?

237
You're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

238
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

239
You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

240
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

241
- Hey!
- Hi, bubbles. Manly.

242
I thought I'd let you know how it went.

243
- You told her?
- She pulled it out of me!

244
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?

245
- You were wrong. He doesn't like me.
- What?

246
How would you like it if I told you
that Lee Majors liked you...

247
...and you found out that he didn't like you?
How would you feel?

248
- I don't think I'd care.
- Really? Lee Majors is hot.

249
- Hello?
- We're in the bathroom!

250
- Why?
- Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

251
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Oh, my God.

252
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

253
- It's Rachel!
- You like Rachel?

254
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

255
Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.

256
Mazel tov.

257
Hey. Oh, hi.
Ross and I were looking for you.

258
What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.

259
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

260
Hello?

261
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

262
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

263
- Did you tell them?
- I waited for you.

264
- Tell us what?
- We're having a girl.

265
Oh, wow! Really? Oh, my God!

266
I'll get you later.

267
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

268
That's all. Just a little crush.

269
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy. Crazy.

270
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

271
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

272
- Hi, sweetie.
- I love you.

273
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

274
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

275
- I'm not touching you.
- You're not?

276
- It's the salts.
- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

277
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.

﻿1
- Hey. What's up?
- I left my guitar here again.

2
Oh, okay. No problem.

3
- Okay. Here you go.
- Okay.

4
Okay, um...

5
- What?
- You want to hang out or something?

6
Phoebe, you caught me at a bad time.

7
- Oh, are you and Chandler...?
- Yes. Exactly.

8
- Okay. Want me to play for you?
- No.

9
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

10
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

11
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

12
- Phoebe, I can explain.
- You told me you hate massages.

13
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

14
I can't believe this.
How long has this been going on?

15
- Well, uh, Alexandra has...
- Oh, it has a name?

16
Phoebe, don't get upset.

17
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

18
Well, I thought I'd...

19
Yeah, what the hell.

20
- Okay, come on. One more push.
- Unh!

21
Come on, we're almost there.

22
Joey, I'm so happy things worked out
for us and we're having this baby together.

23
- I love you so much.
- Oh, I love you too.

24
Mm. I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say this...

25
...but you're the best sex I've ever had.

26
- That's always appropriate.
- Ha, ha.

27
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

28
There we go.

29
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

30
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

31
Whoa! Aah, whoa.

32
- Joey!
- What, what?

33
- What's going on? Uh...
- Feel this. Come feel my belly.

34
The baby's kicking for the first time.
Please come feel.

35
- Really? Uh...
- Yes.

36
You know what? Maybe, uh, you...

37
Maybe you should come to me.

38
- I'm not wearing any bottoms.
- Oh, okay.

39
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

40
It's unbelievable!

41
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like, um...

42
Who's that kind of
annoying girl soccer player?

43
- Mia Hamm?
- Mia Hamm!

44
- Oh! It's amazing.
- Whoa. One hand on the sheet, Joe.

45
Whoa, eh. Sorry.

46
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, honey.

47
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

48
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

49
- Maybe we can take it back.
- Doesn't say where it's from.

50
- Where would we return it?
- How about to the street, from the balcony?

51
Why don't we just find a place for it?

52
How about in that cabinet?

53
That's where we keep canned goods.

54
Have you forgotten everything
you learned in orientation?

55
How about the closet by the bathroom?

56
Oh. Okay.
Why don't you let me do it.

57
No, no, no. I will do it.

58
You have to relax and let your husband
take care of things once in a while.

59
It's locked. You have to help me.

60
Why is it locked?

61
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

62
You know, I've been living here a while...

63
...and I've never seen
what's in that closet.

64
What is in there?

65
Feminine stuff.

66
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

67
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

68
- Fine.
- Thank you.

69
Love you.

70
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

71
If it helps, Alexandra's only been
massaging Monica for, like, three years.

72
If! I said, if it helps.

73
Why won't you let me massage you?

74
Uh, well, it's... I'd be self-conscious.

75
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

76
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

77
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

78
I'm curious about the human body.

79
You can understand
why this would be weird for me.

80
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

81
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Just give me a chance, okay? Please?

82
Okay, if it means that much to you.

83
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

84
Or imagine how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

85
- Dinosaurs.
- Potato, "potato."

86
- Hey.
- Ross, the baby's kicking.

87
What? It is?

88
It's not kicking right now.

89
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

90
When was it kicking? What happened?

91
Last night. I felt it. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

92
A dreamless sleep.

93
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

94
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

95
I got some stuff going on
in here if you want to feel.

96
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

97
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it. I'll be there.

98
I don't care if it's 3 in the morning
and you want ice cream.

99
Wow. Can I get a copy of that?

100
- Are you under the sheet?
- Yes.

101
Great, let's begin.

102
- How's the pressure?
- Ah.

103
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

104
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

105
- And it's not weird, is it?
- No.

106
That's right, you just enjoy.

107
Oh, yeah!

108
Oh, oh!

109
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay.

110
Oh, God, Phoebe!

111
Oh, that's it! That's it, right there! Oh!

112
I wasn't trying to open your closet.
I wasn't trying, I swear.

113
Wow. Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

114
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see what's in it.

115
- Why not?
- I don't know!

116
What could she possibly be hiding in here
what I can't see?

117
I don't know. Ooh.

118
I'll bet it's Richard.

119
Why would Monica be keeping Richard
in here?

120
Well, off the top of my head, uh...

121
...maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

122
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

123
- Or...
- And here we go.

124
I saw this movie once
where there was a door.

125
Nobody knew what was behind it.

126
And when they finally got it open, millions
and millions of bugs came pouring out...

127
...and they feasted on human flesh!

128
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

129
Stupid closet full of bugs!

130
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't... Whoa!

131
Whoa! Don't worry.
When my sisters were pregnant...

132
...they got every weird feeling
and it was always nothing.

133
- Really?
- Absolutely.

134
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

135
Okay, oh, God... Ow.

136
Oh, okay, Rach, look at me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

137
- Okay.
- Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

138
Ow! Crushing bones!

139
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

140
- Hey. So?
- She's fine.

141
She was experiencing
Braxton Hicks contractions.

142
- Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
- Hmm.

143
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

144
- Everything is normal?
- Yes.

145
- There's no danger to her or the baby?
- No.

146
Contractions can be unnerving
if you don't know, but she's fine.

147
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

148
Calm? I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

149
- You said everything was okay.
- What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

150
- But everything is okay. I'm fine.
- You sure?

151
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

152
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

153
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

154
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?

155
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

156
Ugh, oh. Ha, ha.

157
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

158
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.

159
Hey, uh, what's with the candy?

160
When you beeped me I was at
the concession stand at the movies.

161
- You went to the movies by yourself?
- No... Mona!

162
- Oh, I gotta go back in there.
- Why? What's wrong?

163
- Everything's fine, I just gotta...
- No, really, tell me. What's up?

164
Look, I forgot my underwear.

165
So thanks so much
for bringing her to the hospital.

166
Oh, hey, don't worry about it.
No big deal.

167
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

168
If you have questions...

169
...here's information on Braxton Hicks.
- Thanks.

170
And by the way, you did the right thing
by bringing her in.

171
- You're gonna make a wonderful father.
- Oh, uh...

172
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

173
- There has got to be a way.
- Easy there, Captain Kirk.

174
- Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
- Yeah.

175
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

176
Then why do you throw like one?

177
- Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
- Oh, sure, "Monica."

178
So how's the hideously
inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?

179
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

180
Well, you sure found that quick.

181
I just wish I didn't feel this way
about Rachel.

182
I wish things could go back to normal.

183
I mean, I love living with her,
and helping out with the baby is amazing.

184
But now I think Ross feels left out.

185
You know?
When I had to take Rachel to the hospital...

186
...the doctor thought I was the father.
God, you...

187
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

188
By the way,
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

189
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

190
Hey, you try opening it with a credit card?

191
- That's a good idea. Okay.
- Yeah.

192
- So, uh, Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
- Ugh.

193
- I ju... I feel terrible.
- It's not your fault.

194
What are you gonna do,
not take her to the hospital?

195
You're doing nothing wrong.

196
Except for harboring an all-consuming
love for the woman carrying his baby.

197
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

198
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.

200
No, no, I got that.

201
So, um, what do you say
we make it a weekly appointment?

202
Okay.

203
You should know though,
I've, um, raised my rates to $200 an hour.

204
- Okay.
- I mean 500.

205
- What?
- 600.

206
What's going on?

207
Oh, you make sex noises
when you get massaged.

208
- Wha...?
- And it really freaked me out.

209
After a while, I even tried to hurt you
and it just spurred you on.

210
What? You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

211
Really? There's nothing sexual
about this?

212
Oh, God! Oh, oh, oh!

213
What are you looking at?

214
I mean, hi.

215
This is so embarrassing.
I'm never gonna get massaged again.

216
No, you can't let this stop you
from getting massages.

217
Look, I have lots of clients
that make the same noises you do.

218
- Really?
- Well, not clients. Lovers.

219
Let's just... We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

220
- You sure?
- Yes.

221
- I guess.
- Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

222
So did you hear something you liked?

223
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick. Huh?

224
- Hey, uh, I brought you some lunch.
- Oh!

225
- That's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
- Eh.

226
Mm, mm.

227
- Did you put pickles on this?
- Well, yeah.

228
What? What? Rach, what?

229
- What's going on?
- I made her favorite, tuna with pickle.

230
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

231
Giving her pickle is
like giving me salad.

232
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
You gonna be okay?

233
I'll be fine.

234
But someone make sure
that sandwich is gone when I get out.

235
I'm on it!

236
I can't believe this. I shouldn't be the one
making her throw up.

237
- Dude, relax. It could happen to anyone.
- Not to you. You know this stuff.

238
I don't know any of it
and I'm the father.

239
I just... I wish I could be
more involved, you know?

240
Ugh.

241
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

242
Hey, uh, can I talk to you guys
for a second?

243
- Yeah.
- What's up?

244
Well... Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

245
Are you breaking up with us?

246
The thing is...

247
...because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of the stuff.

248
Okay, and Ross...

249
Ross is missing everything. So...

250
Yeah?

251
Maybe you two should live together.

252
Are you asking me to move out?
Do you not want me here?

253
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that...

254
...if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

255
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in to his apartment...

256
...and disrupt his life like that. I mean...

257
Or he does.

258
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

259
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

260
- But it's you and me.
- It wouldn't be anything romantic.

261
And I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

262
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

263
So, what do you think?

264
- I don't know. Is it crazy?
- No. No, it's not...

265
Joey, this is a smart idea.

266
Well, I was due.

267
- Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
- Really?

268
- Oh, Rach, that's great. That's great.
- Mm.

269
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself...

270
...using my wife's tools.

271
Oh, my God.

272
How did you get in there?

273
You're messy.

274
- No! You weren't supposed to see this!
- I married Fred Sanford.

275
No, Chandler, you don't understand.

276
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know. Okay?
I'm sick.

277
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

278
I love you in spite of that.

279
Really?

280
- Promise you won't tell anyone?
- Yes.

281
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff
lying around, can we share the closet?

282
Oh. Well, it's just, um...

283
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

284
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
So Rachel's all moved out, huh?
How you taking it?

286
Well, uh, I wanted to have a few beers...

287
...but, uh, I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.

288
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium though.

289
And, uh, it's a couple weeks past its
expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

290
- Are you okay?
- You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

291
I'm, uh... I'm better than great. I am good.

292
Now that she's gone, I can, uh...

293
I can do all the stuff around here
that I couldn't do before. You know?

294
Like, um...

295
I can walk around naked again.

296
You know? I can, uh...

297
I can watch porn in the living room.
Right?

298
This is, uh... This is good for me.

299
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

300
I'm a... I'm a lone wolf.

301
A loner. Alone.

302
All alone. Forever.

303
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

304
- That's it, just relax.
- Unh.

305
Oh, oh!

306
- Come on, more.
- Oh, God!

307
You like that, don't you?

308
- Yeah, right there.
- Want it there? Take it there, baby.

309
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, say my name. Say it.

310
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.

311
And, um, I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.

﻿1
- Oh! Hey, Rach!
- Hi.

2
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- You too!

3
Hey, so, uh, how's it going
living over at Ross'?

4
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

5
Did you know that something
really boring...

6
...happened to someone
really ugly in the Middle Ages?

7
- Thank you. See you guys later.
- Okay.

8
- Bye.
- Bye.

9
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

10
Oh, honey.

11
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

12
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

13
Thanks. Maybe later.

14
- Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
- You want anything?

15
You know what I want?
I want a lot of things.

16
I wanna be with the woman I love
on Valentine's Day!

17
I want her to love me back.

18
And I want one moment of relief...

19
...from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing
that's never gonna happen!

20
We have red bagels.

21
Okay.

22
So how does Mona feel about
you and Rachel living together?

23
I'm on my way to tell her right now.

24
She's been away all week visiting parents,
but she'll be cool.

25
She's been so supportive.

26
She even got the baby a tiny T-shirt
that says, "Fossils are my friends."

27
Ugh, come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

28
- So, uh, I'm gonna take off.
- All right.

29
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape.

30
- What is it?
- A video of my friend giving birth.

31
- Could you bring it back to your apartment?
- All right.

32
"Candy and Cookie"?

33
Yeah, Candy's the mother,
Cookie's the daughter.

34
The father's name is also Cookie.

35
Why am I friends with these people?

36
Phoebe, come here. I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

37
Ugh, Monica, grow up.

38
- What do you got behind your back?
- Nothing.

39
Just something I want
Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.

40
- You don't want my opinion?
- Not really.

41
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

42
Oh, okay, big brother. Um...

43
Which one would make
your little sister look hotter...

44
...so your best friend
would want to do her?

45
The red one.

46
- Hey.
- Mm.

47
I know you've been depressed lately,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

48
Right outside this door
is a real, live, furry playmate.

49
No, I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

50
Hee-hee!
- Hey, a dog! Oh, hi!

51
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

52
This is the happiest dog in the world.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

53
So you can keep him until he cheers
you up. And he will cheer you up.

54
Thanks so much, Pheebs.

55
We are gonna have so much fun!
Yes we are!

56
Oh, not that kind of fun.

57
- Happy Valentine's!
- Hey!

58
I'll be right out.

59
I'm slipping into something a little less
comfortable and a little more slutty.

60
"Candy and Cookie"?

61
Monica got me porn?

62
Girl-on-girl porn?

63
She really must love me!

64
Yeah, just relax.
- I love you, St. Valentine.

65
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

66
- Now push!
- Unh!

67
Ow! Oh, God, it hurts!

68
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

69
- Oh, make it stop!
- I am trying!

70
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

71
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

72
Yeah. Did I just throw this?

73
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

75
- Who is this?
- That's, uh, Phoebe's friend's dog.

76
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

77
Ohh, you are so cute. I wish I could play
with you more, but I've gotta go to work.

78
I hope I stop talking like this before
my marketing meeting. Yes, I do.

79
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

80
Come here! Hey!

81
Hey. That's Rachel.
She's the one who used to live here.

82
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

83
But we can't have her. No.

84
I really miss her.

85
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

86
Well, you used to be.

87
So, what do you think?

88
I've still got it.

89
- Why did you get me this?
- What is it?

90
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

91
Oh, the dilating!

92
Is this the video of the baby being born?
This is Phoebe's.

93
Why were you even watching it?

94
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

95
Chandler, if you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day...

96
...you were right.

97
Apparently, it's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom...

98
...but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

99
It got four stars.

100
Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

101
- Anyway, you wanna take a look?
- Well...

102
- I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
- Hey, what's going on?

103
Well, remember the first time
you saw Jaws...

104
...how long it took
to go back in the water?

105
Chandler, we can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

106
- You don't know. You didn't see it.
- Childbirth is a natural thing. It's beautiful.

107
Oh, beautiful? Really? Huh, really?

108
You think this is beautiful?

109
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

110
- See, honey, there's...
- Don't touch me!

111
- Hi!
- Hey!

112
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
- So how was Atlantic City?
- Good.

114
- I brought you back a present.
- What...?

115
Come on, you didn't have to...

116
- Saltwater taffy?
- Ha-ha-ha.

117
- Thanks.
- Mm.

118
It's interesting, most people think
this is made with seawater.

119
But it's actually made with,
uh, salted fresh water.

120
That's not interesting.

121
- I think it's interesting.
- I do too. I missed you!

122
- Me too. How was your week?
- Oh, it was good.

123
- Actually, the baby started kicking.
- How exciting.

124
Yeah, aw. It was amazing.

125
The only sad thing is, I wasn't around
when it happened the first time.

126
- Oh, no.
- I was missing out on all this stuff.

127
- Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
- Ha, ha. Yeah, right.

128
- What?
- Joey cracks me up.

129
"Yeah, have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward at all." Heh.

130
Huh. Heh.

131
Hey, imagine, I go away for a few days...

132
...I come back and my boyfriend is living
with some woman he got pregnant.

133
So, what'd you tell him?

134
How could you not tell Mona
that Rachel is living with you?

135
I don't know. She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

136
Plus, she, uh... She got me taffy.

137
- Taffy, really? I've never had any.
- Ever?

138
My mother was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

139
Thank you.

140
So are you just never gonna tell her?

141
No, no, I will.
I just want to butter her up first.

142
I'm gonna take her to an amazing
Valentine's dinner...

143
...do all this romantic stuff.

144
And then, when she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend in the world...

145
...then I tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

146
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

147
So where are...? What the
mother of crap is up with this stuff?

148
God, is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

149
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

150
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross...

151
...it just isn't gonna happen.

152
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

153
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

155
You're subdued.

156
- Did you give him a beer?
- No.

157
- Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
- Sure.

158
Oh, me, right.

159
- He's miserable. What happened to him?
- Nothing.

160
- We just talked about stuff.
- What stuff?

161
Rachel stuff.

162
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

163
He spends a day with you,
and look at him.

164
He's breathing.

165
- I'll take him back to Wendy's.
- No, no, no. He's fine.

166
Hey, look. Look.

167
Here's your ball! Get the ball!

168
Get your ball! Get your ball!
Get your ball!

169
Get... God, what have I done to you?
Huh?

170
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

171
I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona.
What you got going on tonight?

172
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.

173
I've got Chinese food on the way,
and the rest of your saltwater taffy.

174
It's interesting. Most people think that's
made with seawater, when in fact...

175
Ross, we actually watched
the documentary together.

176
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

177
Mona?

178
- What are...? Hi!
- Hi.

179
What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to pick you up.

180
Change of plans, I made you
a Valentine's dinner. Surprise!

181
- Oh! Hey, Mona!
- Hi... Hi, Rachel.

182
What's she doing here?

183
I have no idea.

184
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

185
Seriously, what is she doing?

186
Uh, you know, lately she just likes
hanging out here.

187
- Why?
- I think she's lonely.

188
- But it's Valentine's Day.
- I know.

189
Can't we ask her to go?

190
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

191
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

192
I'm not here!
That's just my Chinese food.

193
Oh, my God,
she has food delivered here?

194
Mm-hm, yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

195
You know what? I'm gonna
get in my sweats and eat this in bed.

196
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

197
Okay, why don't you, uh, open
the champagne, and I will be right back.

198
- I've got a surprise for you.
- You got another ex-wife back there?

199
Ho, oh! Heh. Please start drinking.

200
- I'm just gonna grab the phone.
- Oh, Rachel, wait. Hey, um...

201
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, but, um...

202
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, do you need the phone?

203
No. No.

204
Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything,
but this is his apartment.

205
And we gotta have some boundaries.

206
So why don't you go to your place
and give us some privacy?

207
But, Mona, I live here.

208
Happy Valentine's Day!

209
Or, something to remember me by.

210
- How long has it been this time?
- Ninety seconds.

211
That's better. Ninety seconds
is a long time not to think about it.

212
Except all I did was think about it.

213
I know. It haunts me.

214
Up until now, the worst thing I ever saw...

215
...was my father doing tequila shots
off the naked houseboy.

216
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

217
We have to get past this.

218
Why don't we get rid of the tape
and pretend it never existed.

219
- I could do that.
- Okay.

220
Okay, now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

221
Come here.

222
- Oh, thank God!
- Oi.

223
Come in!

224
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

225
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona is dumping Ross.

226
- Oh, my God.
- Poor Ross.

227
Oh, great. We have to watch him
do yoga in his underwear...

228
...but for this he closes the drapes.

229
Rach, you know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

230
Mm-hm.
- It's here.

231
Oh, and we should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

232
Why, you saw it? Is it scary?

233
Let's just say it's ironic how footage
of someone being born...

234
...can make you want to kill yourself.

235
Now, wait, now I'm all freaked out.
You guys will watch it with me?

236
No, but I will leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

237
Come on, seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

238
She's right. Of course not.

239
Honey, get the tape.

240
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

241
Okay. Here we go.

242
Okay. Ahem.

243
Oh, my.

244
All right, baby. One more time.

245
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

246
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

247
It's still beautiful.

248
- Aah! It's horrible!
- I know, I know!

249
- I'm so sorry for you!
- Oh, my God!

250
- You guys! You guys, look!
- What? Did her ass explode?

251
No, the baby's out. Look. Look.

252
Look at those little fingers and toes.

253
And look how happy the mom is now.

254
- Oh, Rach.
- Screw you! You don't have to do it!

255
- Hey.
- Hey! What...

256
- What's up?
- Uh, Mona just dumped me.

257
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

258
With everything going on lately,
I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.

259
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

260
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

261
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

262
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

263
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

264
Yeah. Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

265
Joey Tribbiani without a date
on Valentine's Day?

266
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Heh.

267
- Sort of. Ha, ha.
- Really?

268
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

269
- Sorry. Well, uh, maybe I can help.
- Oh, I...

270
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

271
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

272
- So anyway, uh, what is it?
- Forget about it. It's no big deal.

273
- Come on, what is it?
- It's nothing.

274
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

275
Okay. Uh, sit down. Um...

276
There's this woman that I like a lot.

277
But, uh, it can't happen.

278
She's not a Tribbiani?

279
No!

280
So, uh... So is she someone from work?

281
Yes.

282
Well, um, does she like you?

283
Sometimes I think maybe she could.

284
But it doesn't matter,
I can't do anything about it.

285
Why not?

286
It's complicated.

287
She was with this other guy.
For a long time.

288
Someone from work too.

289
And, uh...

290
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

291
So, uh, this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

292
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay.

293
Is he a good guy?

294
Yeah, he's the best.

295
- Then talk to him. He might be fine.
- I don't know.

296
It's worth finding out,
if you really like her.

297
I do, so much.

298
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep...

299
Okay, Joey, you know what?
You have to go for it.

300
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

301
Here's your warm milk.

302
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

303
Yeah.

304
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

305
Let me know how it goes.

306
It's Rachel.

307
You're gonna have a baby
and you need to be prepared.

308
You're gonna make yourself watch
the whole thing. Just do it!

309
Heh, I came to the big city to become a star.

310
- I'll do anything to make that happen.
- Anything?

311
Hmm. Maybe it starts
with how she gets pregnant.

﻿1
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

2
Yes.

3
Um, you like Rachel?

4
Yes. I like Rachel.

5
Rachel?

6
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

7
You know who else I like? You.

8
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

9
- "Rachel" Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

10
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just...

11
What about the stuff you said?

12
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

13
I'm an actor, you know?

14
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

15
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

16
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

17
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

18
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

19
You know, I gotta go.

20
Hey, Ross...

21
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?

22
Rachel?

23
Rachel?

24
Oh, oh! Okay, she's kicking.

25
She's growing inside you.

26
- Whoa!
- Oh.

27
- That was a big one.
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

28
- You guys!
- Hey there.

29
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

30
Oh, yes, I do.

31
There's one person out there
for everyone.

32
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

33
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

34
He'll find me.

35
Uh-huh. And you?

36
No. I believe that, uh, certain people are
more suited for each other, but...

37
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
- Good.

38
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

39
- What?
- Yeah.

40
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

41
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

42
Well, what's he like?

43
- He's tall. He has brown hair.
- Of course.

44
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

45
- He works with food.
- Oh, sure. Older?

46
- Obviously. And he's British.
- I was just gonna ask!

47
Yeah? And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

48
It's so sad they never met.

49
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

50
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

51
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

52
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

53
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

54
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

56
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

57
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

58
I know you're hurting...

59
...but don't say that again.

60
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

61
You don't need to worry.

62
He'll never tell her how he feels.

63
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

64
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

65
- He isn't thinking about going for her.
- He's not?

66
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

67
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

68
- Why?
- He wants to leave the country.

69
He thinks you hate him.

70
Hate him?

71
No, I don't hate him.

72
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

73
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you...

74
...but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

75
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

76
Okay, I'll talk to him.

77
I'd do it soon.

78
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

79
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

80
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
- Hello.

81
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

82
Soul mate.

83
- What are you guys doing?
- We had lunch at Adriatica.

84
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
- I know! Is this 1985?

85
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
- Not really.

86
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

87
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

88
No?

89
- What restaurants do you like?
- Octavio. 27-and-7.

90
- There's this place, Alessandro's.
- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

91
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

92
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

93
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

94
What are you doing?

95
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

96
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

97
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

98
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

99
- Phoebe? Good work.
- Yeah?

100
He's great. I love him.

101
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

102
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

104
No, I don't want to hit you.

105
What, then? Kick me?

106
No.

107
Bite me?

108
I don't want to do anything to you.

109
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you...

110
...and that I certainly
do not hate you.

111
I just came here to say that.

112
Hey, wait, Ross?

113
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

114
Yeah, sure.

115
You got any beer?

116
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

117
Okay.

118
You need to understand something.

119
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

120
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

121
Thank you.

122
Mm.

123
Anyway, it'll just...

124
It'll take me a while to get over her.

125
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so...

126
What?

127
You're in love with her?

128
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.
- Um, no.

129
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

130
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

131
But it just keeps getting harder.

132
I don't know what to do, you know?

133
What do I do?

134
- You need to tell her how you feel.
- That's the green stuff talking.

135
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

136
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

137
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be...

138
If she is where you are...

139
...then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

140
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

141
If she ends up with somebody else...

142
...the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

143
Hey, thanks.

144
- So when are you gonna talk to her?
- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

145
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

146
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

147
Right, sorry. Sorry.

148
What am I gonna say?

149
Yeah, tell me about it.

150
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the, um, cheese.

151
Cheese, you say?

152
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

153
- Excuse me?
- Cheese. It's smelly.

154
You must smell a lot of the time too.

155
Uh, not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

156
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

157
And you're still married to him?

158
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

159
Not even bread. Just cheese.

160
No, I want the bread.

161
And pastries.

162
And pâté.

163
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

164
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

165
Is it made of cheese?

166
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be great?

167
- I'd move in tomorrow!
- Oh, come on!

168
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

169
- What do we do?
- They both want a house of cheese.

170
I don't know how you fight that.

171
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

172
Okay, stand up straight.

173
Take a couple deep breaths.

174
Look confident.

175
Joey? What's up?

176
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

177
What's up?

178
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

179
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

180
I just came by to tell you that...

181
...I want to have dinner with you.

182
- Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
- Okay.

183
Okay. That's good.

184
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

185
Don't you people ever knock?

186
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

187
Sure. Set it up.

188
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

189
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

190
Yeah. Fine.

191
Not perfect.

192
But good enough.

193
Jeez, what's with you?

194
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

195
- What's going on?
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

196
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

197
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

198
- You don't believe in soul mates?
- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

199
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

200
- You don't?
- Nope.

201
We weren't destined
to end up together.

202
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

203
Some days we work really hard.

204
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

205
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

206
- I love you.
- I know.

207
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

208
I found this place that makes the greatest
mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers.

209
No? They taste so good.

210
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

211
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

212
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

213
Uh, look, the reason...

214
Is it hot in here?

215
No, not for me.
Why don't you take off your sweater?

216
This is a nice place...

217
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

218
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

219
Yeah, sure.

220
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

221
Uh...

222
How long have we known each other?

223
Um, seven, eight...

224
Eight years. Wow.

225
- Uh-huh. A long time.
- Yeah.

226
But over the past few weeks, I...

227
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

228
Our specials tonight...

229
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

230
Second's up!

231
Not that kind of table.

232
So you were saying?

233
I'm not sure.

234
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

235
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...

236
...and now here we are.

237
Yeah. Here we are.

238
Uh...

239
I think I'm falling in love with you.

240
What?

241
I'm falling in love with you.

242
Who are you talking to?

243
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

244
Funny. It's funny!

245
I don't get it.

246
Oh.

247
Okay.

248
Wow.

249
Are you, um?

250
How did, um?

251
When?

252
Does it really matter?

253
Wow. Wow.

254
It is hot in here.

255
I know this is a lot.

256
You don't have to say anything.

257
You take as much time as you need.

258
Okay, you gotta say something.

259
Joey, I love you so much.

260
- But...
- But.

261
Joey?

262
Right. Hey, that's, uh...

263
That's okay. That's fine.

264
It's, uh, pretty much
what I was expecting.

265
It's no big deal, all right?

266
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Please don't leave like this.

267
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

268
Don't start doing that.

269
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me...

270
Oh, there we go!

271
- Can I?
- Sure.

272
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

273
Hey, hey.

274
You can't, okay? Ever.

275
I'm so sorry.

276
Please don't be sorry.

277
Okay? Don't be sorry.

278
You know, I was only kidding.

279
Yeah, that was a real good one.

280
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

281
- You'll be here all night.
- I know.

282
I haven't even read the specials.

283
What's the matter?

284
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

285
I kind of hope it's the girl.

286
The guy is really cute!

﻿1
Joey? Are you in there?

2
- Oh, my God, that's Rachel.
- Joey, you have to talk to her.

3
No, I can't. Not after the other night.
It's just... It's too weird, okay?

4
Don't tell her I'm here.

5
Don't eat that.

6
- Hey.
- Rach.

7
- Hey, Rachel.
- Is Joey here?

8
- I don't see him. You see him?
- I don't see him.

9
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
- What's up?
- Well, I haven't seen him since that night...

12
...that he told me how he, you know...

13
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

14
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
- We were playing a game.
- Ew, was Chandler naked?

16
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
- Sure.
- What? No. No.

18
All right, well, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that, uh?

19
Tell him I miss him.

20
- Okay. Did you hear that?
- Yeah. That naked bagel game? Heh.

21
Dude, I don't know.
That's a pretty small hole.

22
- Honey, you've gotta talk to her.
- I can't.

23
You guys don't know what it's like
to put yourself out there like that...

24
...and then just get shot down.

25
I don't know what that's like?

26
Up until I was 25, I thought the only
response to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

27
Hello. No rejection?

28
I got shot down at fat camp.

29
Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.

30
All right, so, what do I do?

31
This is Rachel. What are you gonna do,
never talk to her again?

32
I know it's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

33
Yeah, okay.

34
Whoa. I almost forgot this was on your...

35
We didn't play it.

36
Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.

37
- I didn't know you read tea leaves.
- Oh, yeah, I've done it for years.

38
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

39
You know, and one of the great joys
of life...

40
...is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

41
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

42
- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
- Okay.

43
Ooh. I see a ladder.

44
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

45
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

46
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Who's next?

47
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.

48
Okay.

49
- Um... Oh. Okay, I see a circle.
- Oh.

50
Oh, which can either mean
you're having a baby...

51
...or you're gonna make
a scientific discovery.

52
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

53
- What does yours say, Pheebs?
- Um... Wow, all right.

54
Wow. Yay.

55
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy.
And really soon.

56
And he's gonna be
the man of my dreams.

57
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

58
You.

59
Hey, has anyone seen my shirt?

60
It's a button-down,
like a faded salmon color?

61
You mean your pink shirt?

62
Faded salmon color?

63
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

64
Great, great. Then I must have
left it at Mona's. I knew it.

65
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

66
That's my favorite shirt, okay?
I love that shirt.

67
Well, just ask Mona to give it back.

68
I don't know. I mean, I guess I could.

69
It's just, we didn't really end things
on such good terms.

70
And if I went over there, I'd be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do...

71
...when we broke up:
Jump up my own ass and die.

72
Oh, wait a second, you guys.

73
For the last couple weeks, I've been
seeing that guy everywhere I go.

74
We take the same bus, we go to
the same bookstore, same dry cleaner.

75
Maybe he's the tea guy.

76
Pheebs, did you see that?

77
He totally checked you out
and he is so cute.

78
Mine is a picture of the Village People.
What does that mean?

79
- Hi.
- Hey.

80
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.

82
I thought Joey and I would be okay
once we hung out...

83
...but it's like we don't even know
how to be with each other anymore.

84
- I know it's tough, but things will get better.
- How do you know that?

85
What if it just gets
worse and worse and worse...

86
...to the point where we can't even
be in the same room with each other?

87
I'm not great at the advice.

88
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

89
Some cheese?

90
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

91
Let's just say if I can't find the right
CD case, I just put it in the nearest one.

92
- Okay, well, where is the Cat Stevens CD?
- In the James Taylor case.

93
- Where's the James Taylor CD?
- Honey, I'm gonna save you some time.

94
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

95
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

96
Okay, um, we're just gonna have to
spend some time...

97
...and put the CDs in the right cases.

98
If we're gonna do that,
we should come up with some order.

99
Like alphabetically, or by genre.

100
Hmm, I don't know.
We really have to talk this through.

101
Oh, my God, you guys have such problems.
I feel so terrible for you.

102
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

103
Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing
on this uncomfortable thing.

104
What you need to do
is change the subject.

105
Next time you see him, try to get him
talking about something else.

106
- Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

107
I don't know, maybe you have
a work problem you need his advice on.

108
- Ooh, I could do that. I could do that.
- Good.

109
Honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

110
They were just giving those away
at the store.

111
In exchange for money.

112
Hey.

113
Hi.

114
I really don't know what to tell you, Rach.
I really don't.

115
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

116
- What?
- Yeah, Joey, she's...

117
Rachel's got this really big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher. Heh.

118
Well, you know what? If we're gonna make
dinner, we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.

119
So you, uh, have a big work problem?

120
Yeah. It's, um...

121
Yeah, it's, uh...

122
You know, it's nothing.

123
Oh. Okay.

124
So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off.

125
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's, um...

126
It's my boss.

127
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And, um...

128
And my baby.

129
Yeah?

130
My boss wants to buy my baby.

131
What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.

132
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem.

133
- He wants to buy your baby?
- Can you believe that?

134
- That's crazy.
- That's what I told him.

135
- How did this even happen?
- Well, I'll tell you.

136
See, uh, my boss and, uh, his wife,
they can't have children, so, um...

137
And then when we were
at the Christmas party...

138
...and he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

139
Man. When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby...

140
...I figured it was something
about maternity leave.

141
Oh. Yeah.

142
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

143
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

144
- Mm-hm.
- I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

145
Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

146
We certainly have been seeing
a lot of each other.

147
We have. Maybe we'll see each other
at dinner tomorrow. Say, around 8:00?

148
Well, maybe we will.

149
Oh.

150
Mona?

151
Ow.

152
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

153
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

154
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's still wet.

155
Let me get it out before it sets.
Oh, I have something you could wear.

156
- Here.
- Oh, uh...

157
I don't know if I wanna wear
a woman's shirt.

158
- No, no, that's a man's shirt.
- Awfully pink.

159
It's not pink.

160
Oh, my God, honey,
we are so meant to be together.

161
- Look, we both have the Annie soundtrack.
- Honey, both yours.

162
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

163
- Yeah, the work problem?
- It was perfect.

164
It felt like he was my friend again.

165
- What problem did you tell him you have?
- Oh, that's not important.

166
The point is,
I really think everything's gonna be okay.

167
May I help you?

168
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

169
Isn't it funny how we kept
running into each other?

170
It's as if someone really wants us
to be together.

171
Someone does. Me.

172
Ooh. Witty banter. Well done. Good.

173
- So tell me a little bit about yourself.
- Oh, okay. Well, I'm a masseuse.

174
- And I used to work at this place...
- Do you like to party?

175
I... I like parties.

176
You're wild, aren't you? Heh.

177
- Yeah, I guess. A little.
- Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

178
So, um, anyway...

179
...I... I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess...

180
...for, um... Well, since I was 14.

181
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

182
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

183
Oh, stop it.

184
And your breasts. Mm!

185
Okay. Ahem.

186
Look, uh, you're coming on
a little strong.

187
But I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

188
Because it seems the universe
really wants us to be together.

189
So why don't we start over, okay?
You can just tell me about yourself.

190
- All right.
- Okay.

191
I write erotic novels...

192
...for children.

193
- What?
- They're wildly unpopular.

194
Oh, my God.

195
Also, you might be interested to know
that I have a Ph.D.

196
- Wow, you do?
- Yep. A pretty huge...

197
All right.

198
The sun will come out tomorrow

199
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow

200
There'll be sun

201
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey, honey, listen.

202
Thank you for talking to me yesterday
about that thing with my boss.

203
- That really meant a lot.
- Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know...

204
...that guy's not gonna be bothering you
about that baby thing anymore.

205
- What?
- Let's just say I took care of it.

206
Ooh, let's say more.

207
Don't worry, don't worry.
I just told him, very nicely:

208
"You don't go buying people's babies,
so back off."

209
- What?
- What?

210
No, no, no.

211
Joey, he doesn't wanna buy my baby.
I made that up.

212
What? Why?

213
So that we would have something
to talk about so it wouldn't be awkward.

214
And you couldn't think of anything else?

215
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

216
I can't believe you yelled at my boss.

217
I'm gonna lose my job.
What am I gonna do?

218
You could always sell your baby.

219
Joey, I cannot believe you brought
my boss into this. I'm gonna get fired.

220
- You lied to me.
- Well, she told me to.

221
Chandler has two copies of Annie.

222
Ah.

223
Oh, my God.

224
- Ross!
- Hello.

225
Ross, what are you doing?

226
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

227
Morning. You wanted to see me?

228
Please, come in. Have a seat.

229
- Okay, look, Mr. Zelner...
- Oh, I think it's best that I speak first.

230
Yeah.

231
I've asked Lee from human resources
to be here as a witness to our conversation.

232
Oh, God.

233
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby...

234
...I am sorry. Okay?

235
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was, uh...

236
...I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was due your baby.

237
Yeah, I want to be very clear...

238
...that I understand that it's your baby...

239
...and it is not mine to purchase.

240
Well, as long as we are clear about that.

241
Oh, there it is.

242
- That's not your regular dry cleaners.
- I know.

243
But that creep I went on that date with
goes there so I had to find a new one.

244
I also have to find a new video store,
a new bank...

245
...a new adult bookstore,
a new grocery store...

246
- What?
- A new grocery store.

247
The universe said I was gonna meet
a nice guy and that's what they gave me?

248
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

249
Don't worry, Phoebe,
you're gonna meet someone.

250
If I can meet a great guy,
so can you.

251
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

252
- Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
- Are you kidding?

253
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

254
I'm gonna be over here
watching the dance of the clean shirts.

255
Oh, excuse me.
I think you, uh, dropped...

256
- Wow.
- What?

257
I'm sorry, it's just that
you're so incredibly beautiful.

258
Oh, yeah, well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

259
I hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but I feel like I was meant to pick this up.

260
- Do you believe in that kind of thing?
- A little. Heh.

261
Now you're talking.

262
- Would you like to go have a cup of coffee?
- I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.

263
Ooh. An ink stain.
Hey, can I watch how you get this out?

264
She must have left.

265
- Hi.
- So, what happened?

266
It's all gonna be okay.

267
They're just so happy
I'm not suing them...

268
...that they gave me one extra month
paid maternity leave.

269
So long as I understand that the money
should not be construed...

270
...as a down payment on this
or any other child that I may bear.

271
Wow. Ralph Lauren
is going out of their way...

272
...to show that they're not
in the baby-buying business.

273
- Chandler, can you give us a minute?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

274
- You're kicking me out of my living room?
- Yeah.

275
I'll be in there.

276
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things...

277
I know. I know.

278
But it kind of worked.

279
I mean, you know,
I don't know about you...

280
...but I haven't thought about our thing
since all this.

281
Yeah, you're right.

282
Yeah. It's kind of been like us again,
a little bit.

283
- Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
- Me too.

284
I mean, I haven't thought at all
about how I put myself out there...

285
...and said that stuff and how
you didn't feel the same way about me...

286
...and how it was really awkward.

287
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

288
Item J437-A.

289
Color: Winterberry.

290
Hi, um, listen.
Come here. Come...

291
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

292
I'm really, really sorry. It's just...

293
Listen, Ross, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

294
- You do?
- Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

295
And to be honest,
I still have feelings for you too...

296
...and I wish we could work out, Ross,
but we can't.

297
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just...

298
It just wasn't meant to be.

299
Oh, God. You're right.

300
- Ross, we have to be strong.
- Mm.

301
Okay, I'm gonna go.

302
Can I? To remember you?

303
No.

﻿1
Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary party?

2
- Sure.
- Yeah.

3
- Who's the guy?
- Parker, I met him at the dry cleaners.

4
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
Who said that?

6
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
And he treats me like a queen.

8
Except at night, when he treats me
like the naughty girl I am.

9
Oh, by the way, would it be okay
if I give the toast this year?

10
Are you sure you want to
after what happened at their 20th?

11
- Yeah, I'd really like to.
- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

12
Yes. Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

13
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

14
No, really, any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and pats him on the back.

15
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

16
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

17
Well, I can promise you,
at least one person will be crying.

18
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

19
- Really? You can do that?
- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

20
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me.

21
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on my toast for the party.

22
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

23
- Hey, check this out.
- It's a dog.

24
It's a dead dog.

25
That's Chi-Chi.
She died when I was in high school.

26
- You're gonna talk about their dead pet?
- It's good stuff, huh?

27
- Hi.
- Hey.

28
Joey? You got a present for my parents?
That's so sweet.

29
Yeah. In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

30
Aw.

31
- That is so cool.
- And I got them Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

32
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

33
What do you need? We got, uh, lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...

34
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

35
AW. Chi-Chi. Oh, I loved this dog.

36
You know, uh, Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

37
- What?
- You were the 200-pounder who rode her.

38
Hey. Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is...

39
No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

40
...and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

41
Chandler, I'm kidding.
Already you're my favorite.

42
- Tell me a little about yourselves.
- Uh, actually, we should get going.

43
Classic Ross.

44
Rachel, Rachel, look how you glow.
May I?

45
I think you already are.

46
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

47
Is there anything more miraculous...
Ooh, a picture of a dog. Whose is this?

48
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

49
Well, at least you were lucky to have him.
Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

50
- So where's the party?
- Out on the island. It's in Massapequa.

51
Massapequa, it sounds magical.
Is it steeped in Native American history?

52
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

53
- I've got my notes. You got the presents?
- Yeah.

54
- I've got the car keys.
- We're driving?

55
- Yeah.
- Aces.

56
- So, uh, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like him a lot.

57
- You want to hang back and take a cab?
- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

58
- Oh.
- Hey.

59
- Hey, Mom.
- This is such a great party.

60
Thirty-five years. Very impressive.
Do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?

61
- Jack?
- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

62
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

63
- Congratulations, you two.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

64
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

65
What?

66
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?
- Yeah.

67
It's just a little thing.

68
While we think it's simply marvelous that
you're having this baby out of wedlock...

69
...some of our friends
are less open-minded.

70
- Which is why we told them you're married.
- What?

71
Thanks for going along with this.

72
- We have to pretend that we're married?
- Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight.

73
You can do this.

74
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

75
If you're gonna do the ears, you may
as well take a pass at the nose area.

76
No, no, I don't want to have to lie
about us being married.

77
I know. I don't either.
But it's their party, and it's one night.

78
We don't even have to lie.
We just won't say anything.

79
If it comes up, we'll smile,
we'll nod along...

80
- Ross?
- Rachel?

81
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

82
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

83
- Here's something to get you started.
- So how's marriage treating you?

84
- Unbelievable. It's great.
- I love marriage.

85
We'll see you later.

86
- Hey.
- Hi.

87
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

88
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C...

89
...I feel so lucky. To think of all the
good times that have happened here.

90
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat.

91
But none of it will compare with tonight.
My God, I don't want to forget this moment.

92
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

93
I don't think the flash went off.

94
- I'm gonna go find the men's room.
- I'll go with you.

95
Somewhere, there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun...

96
...and a huge butterfly net
looking for that man.

97
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

98
I'm so glad we weren't in the car.
Did he ever let up?

99
He called the Long Island Expressway
a concrete miracle.

100
This room. This night.

101
That waiter. His shoes.
I must take a mental picture.

102
Sorry.

103
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

104
That depends, how much did you hear?

105
Well, he's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

106
- It's just... It's so much.
- Well, so what? I like him.

107
Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

108
No, because friends don't do that.
But do you want my opinion?

109
In my opinion, your collective dating record
reads like a who's who of human crap.

110
- I feel terrible.
- I know.

111
What was wrong with Mona?

112
- Open it, open it, open it.
- Yeah, baby.

113
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

114
- We were surprised we weren't invited.
- Oh, no, it was just our parents.

115
It was a small wedding.

116
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

117
- Where did you have it?
- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

118
And Stevie Wonder sang "isn't She Lovely"
as I walked down the aisle.

119
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
- Stevie's an old family friend.
- Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.

121
- I'd love to see pictures.
- Yeah, so would I.

122
You wouldn't think that Annie Leibovitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

123
Would you excuse us for a second?

124
- Um, what are you doing?
- What? I'm not you.

125
This may be the only wedding
leverhave.

126
- And I want it to be amazing.
- Okay. Okay. Ooh. Ooh.

127
- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
- Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.

128
Say, uh, ahem, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

129
- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
- And I'm with you.

130
What a great time to be alive.

131
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

132
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

133
Mm-hm. Yeah.

134
- Ah. Oysters. Let me feed you one.
- That's not necessary.

135
- Please?
- No, actually, I don't eat...

136
- I won't quit until you try one.
- Okay, fine, fine.

137
- Mm. Mm-hm. Good.
- What're they like? I've never had one.

138
- Why don't you just try one?
- Nah, they look too weird.

139
- What are you doing?
- Just going over my toast.

140
Ah, those two will never know
what hit them.

141
I can't wait. They're gonna cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

142
You know, if you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just:

143
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

144
- Blind?
- Well, not at first, but it was intricate work.

145
And they said even though they lost
their sight, it was all worth it.

146
- I bet you looked beautiful.
- Oh, well, I don't know about that.

147
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

148
- How did you propose?
- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

149
Well, um, actually,
I took her to the planetarium.

150
That's where we had our first date.

151
Um, she walked in, and I had the room
filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.

152
- That is so sweet.
- Shh. I want to hear the rest.

153
Then Fred Astaire singing, uh,
"The Way You Look Tonight"...

154
...came on the sound system
and the lights came down...

155
...and I got on one knee...

156
...and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

157
"Will you marry me?"

158
Aw.

159
And the ring was the size of my fist.

160
Hey, uh, Phoebe? Look, uh...

161
...I want to apologize about before, okay?
We were being jerks.

162
Parker's a nice guy,
and I'd like to get to know him.

163
Then you better do it now.

164
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna kill him.

165
- What?
- You guys were right.

166
He's just too excited
about everything.

167
I mean, I'm all for living life, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

168
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

169
I know. I'm having the worst time.

170
There was a 15-minute line for the buffet,
and when I finally got up to the plates...

171
...I slipped on a giant booger.

172
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

173
I guess it could've been.
I didn't really look at it.

174
I just wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out of there.

175
I just thought he was such a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

176
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

177
There's nothing wrong with him.
He's a good guy.

178
- You think?
- Yeah, know what I think?

179
- We were all just being too negative.
- You're right.

180
You're right. He's just embracing life.
We could all stand to be more like Parker.

181
You know what? I am like him.
I'm a sunny, positive person.

182
- Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
- What's that now?

183
- Oh, it's Parker.
- Look, the Bunny Hop.

184
- Oh, I love it.
- You do?

185
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on.

186
Okay, it's time for the toast.

187
I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'm gonna do it.

188
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

189
Okay, um...

190
Mom, Dad, when I got married...

191
...one of the things
that made me sure that I could do it...

192
...was the amazing example
the two of you set for me.

193
For that, and for so many other things,
I wanna say thank you.

194
I know I probably don't
say it enough...

195
...but I love you.

196
When I look around this room...

197
...I'm saddened by the thought
of those who could not be with us.

198
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

199
But she can't...

200
...because she's dead.

201
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

202
I mean, look how cute she is... Was.

203
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

204
Remember, um, she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

205
Wow.

206
Um...

207
Hey, does anybody remember when...

208
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye
to her children in Terms of Endearment?

209
Didn't see that?

210
No movie fans?

211
You want to hear something sad?

212
Um, the other day
I was watching 60 Minutes...

213
...and there was this piece
on these orphans in Romania...

214
...who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

215
You people are made of stone.

216
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever.

217
Thank you, Monica.
That was, uh, interesting.

218
- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
- Why don't I remember this dog?

219
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

220
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

221
You're not gonna say anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

222
No, of course, um...

223
Um, everybody?
Um, ahem, I just wanted to say...

224
...uh, on behalf of my new bride,
Rachel...

225
...and myself, um, that if...

226
If in 35 years,
we're half as happy as you guys are...

227
...we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

228
Oh, Ross.

229
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

230
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

231
Can I, um, get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

232
I must say, this apartment,
it's... there are no words.

233
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a haven.

234
- A third-floor paradise, a modern-day Eden.
- Yeah, I know, I know. Uh-huh. Gotcha.

235
Listen, why don't we just, um, sit and relax,
you know, just be with each other quietly.

236
- That sounds great.
- Uh-huh.

237
My God, this is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on in my entire life.

238
Let's try something else.
Let's play a game.

239
- I love games.
- Shocking.

240
Um, let's play the game of...

241
...who can stay quiet the longest.

242
Or Jenga.

243
Let's play this one first, and remember,
whoever talks first loses.

244
- I lose, now Jenga.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

245
- Is something wrong?
- Wrong? You know the word "wrong"?

246
Everything isn't perfect?
Everything isn't magical?

247
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of a million fairies?

248
They were just brake lights, Parker.

249
Well, excuse me for putting
a good spin on a traffic jam.

250
But you don't have to put
a good spin on everything.

251
I'm sorry. That's who I am.
I'm a positive person.

252
No, I'm a positive person.

253
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

254
At Disneyland, getting laid.

255
So, what do you want me to do?
You want me to be more negative?

256
- You want me to be less happy?
- Much less happy.

257
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

258
So long.

259
Hey. Don't let the best door in the world
hit you in the ass on your way out.

260
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've ever had in your entire life?

261
We could've gone from the ceremony
to the reception with you in the sidecar.

262
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.

263
But having a dove place the ring
on your finger would've been no problem.

264
It was really fun
being married to you tonight.

265
Yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks
I ever made.

266
- Okay, Ross, can I, um, ask you something?
- Yeah.

267
- That proposal at the planetarium?
- I know, I know. It was stupid.

268
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

269
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

270
Uh, no, actually, I thought about it
when we were going out.

271
That's how I imagined
I, uh, would ask you to marry me.

272
Wow.

273
Well, that would've been, uh,
very hard to say no to.

274
Well, it's a good thing I didn't do it...

275
...because it sounds like it would have been
a very expensive wedding.

276
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

277
Uh, even if the sidecar had a windscreen
so your hair wouldn't get messed up?

278
- I will think about it.
- That's all I'm asking.

279
Okay, that's it. I give up.

280
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you're the one giving the speech.

281
You know, I don't understand why
they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.

282
- Oh, come on.
- Hey. That stuff you said about true love?

283
You were right. I mean,
we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad.

284
And that picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

285
And what you said about Nana?

286
Oh, yeah, she really would've
wanted to be there.

287
And you know what?

288
I think she was.

289
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it'?

﻿1
- Hi.
- Hi.

2
So I'm in my apartment doing
the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle...

3
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

4
Three down. "Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

5
That's me! I'm blank! Hey.

6
How cool is. We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

7
Yeah, you are, baby.

8
Three down knows I'm married.

9
- What's three down doing?
- Sorry.

10
So do they call you to tell you
your name's gonna be in this?

11
No. They really liked me there.

12
They wanted to do a profile on me.
I said no.

13
Why'd you say no?

14
Remember what happened
the last time I did an interview?

15
I said I write a lot of my own lines,
then the writers got mad...

16
...and made my character fell down
the elevator shaft.

17
So who knows
what I might say this time?

18
If only there was something in your head
to control the things you say.

19
Oh, come on, Joey,
you'll totally keep it in check this time.

20
And plus, you know, the publicity
would be really good for your career.

21
And you deserve that.

22
And if you do the interview,
you could mention...

23
...oh, I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green.

24
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

25
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?

26
Fine, all right, I'll do it.

27
But, hey. You guys have to be
at the next table...

28
...so you can stop me if I,
you know, start to say something stupid.

29
Just then or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

30
Come on, we will be there for you
the whole time. Just remember:

31
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

32
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest.

33
And not just in the dumb
crossword puzzle.

34
- Seriously, proud of you.
- Yeah.

35
I really appreciate you
taking the time to do this.

36
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.

37
You think we're being obvious?

38
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

39
I think it's great
that you wanted to meet here.

40
When most people hear
that the magazine's paying for it...

41
...they want a big, fancy restaurant.

42
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

43
Wouldn't have mattered.

44
I'm doing this for the fans,
not the free food. Ha, ha.

45
- Can I get you anything?
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

46
Yeah, and I'll have all the muffins.

47
- Hey.
- Shh. We're not talking.

48
Oh, finally. Ugh.

49
So according to your bio, you've done
quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives.

50
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

51
All you want is a dingle

52
What you envy's a shwang

53
A thing through which you can tinkle

54
Or play with, or simply let hang

55
Folks, this ever happen to you?
You go to the fridge to get a glass of milk...

56
...but these darn cartons
are so fringing-flanging hard to open.

57
Boy, you said it, Mike. I don't...

58
Oh, oh.

59
- There's gotta be a better way.
- And there is, Kevin.

60
He's never used this product before.

61
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.
Go ahead.

62
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy.

63
- Now I can have milk every day.
- Ah.

64
So this is it, Victor?

65
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

66
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

67
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

68
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

69
But I won't have aged at all.

70
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

71
Because, Adrian...

72
. "baby".

73
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

74
Shh, shh. Okay, here I come. Here I come.
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

75
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"

76
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

77
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

78
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, wait, wait, you see me again.

79
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

80
There I am. There I am. There I am.

81
Well, there are so many things,
you know, it's hard to pickjust one.

82
- I'm gonna get some coffee. Want anything?
- Oh, yeah.

83
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte, extra foam.

84
- And a bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

85
Okay. How about
when you're not working?

86
What do you do in your spare time?

87
Look at this clown.
Just because he's got a bigger boat...

88
...he thinks he can
take up the whole river.

89
Get out of the way, jackass!

90
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

91
That is the Coast Guard.

92
What are they doing out here?
The coast is all the way over there.

93
- Hi.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

94
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

95
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

96
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

97
Don't you think the cowboy hat
is a little much?

98
Come on, it's fun.

99
All right.

100
Isn't this a woman's hat?

101
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

102
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

103
I think you're right.

104
- All right, ready?
- One.

105
- Two, three.
- Three.

106
That's kind of nice.

107
- Yeah, it's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

108
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

109
- Free porn! We have free porn here!
- Yeah.

110
In my spare time,
I, uh, read to the blind.

111
And I'm also a mento for kids.

112
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

113
- A mento?
- Right.

114
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

115
Well, um, another thing that our readers
always want to know...

116
...is how soap stars
stay in such great shape.

117
Do you have some kind
of a fitness regime?

118
Uh, we stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

119
Wow, you realize we've been throwing
this ball without dropping it for an hour?

120
Are you serious?

121
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to say anything...

122
...because I didn't want to jinx it.

123
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

124
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

125
Oh. I think that's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

126
Yeah, I think my pants are a little loose.

127
What's wrong with you?

128
Oh, I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

129
And then I, uh, passed out.

130
I haven't been able to stand up since.
Ha, ha. But I don't think it's serious.

131
This sounds like a hernia.
You have to... Go to the doctor.

132
No way.

133
Look, if I go to the doctor for anything...

134
...it's gonna be for this thing
sticking out of my stomach.

135
Why'd I have to start working out again?

136
Damn you, 15's.

137
- What is it?
- It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers.

138
First, there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

139
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

140
Then raspberries, more ladyfingers...

141
...then beef sautéed
with peas and onions.

142
Then a little bit more custard.

143
It tastes like feet.

144
I like it.

145
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

146
Jam, good. Meat, good.

147
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

148
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

149
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

150
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

151
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

152
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

153
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

154
All right, what are we having?

155
Uh, I don't believe in these crazy diets.
You know, just everything in moderation.

156
- Your muffins.
- Uh...

157
I'll take those to go.

158
For the kids.

159
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you.

160
You were on the show years ago
and then they killed you off.

161
What happened there?

162
Oh, it's so stupid.

163
I said some stuff in an interview
that I shouldn't have said.

164
But believe me,
that is not gonna happen today.

165
Understood.
So, what did you say back then?

166
Oh, I said that I...

167
GROUP
Hey, Joey! How you doing?

168
You guys, this is Shelly. She's
interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest.

169
- Hi.
- Shelly, these are my friends.

170
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.

171
Um, and if you want the dirt,
I'm the one you come to.

172
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

173
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

174
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

175
- I'm gonna go get this warmed up.
- Okay.

176
- Joey, you're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

177
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

178
So as Joey's friends...

179
...is there anything you think
our readers ought to know?

180
Uh, no, just that he is a great guy.

181
Yeah, that's gonna get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

182
Well, I...

183
I would just like to say that Joey...

184
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

185
Um, I just think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

186
- Oh, I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

187
How do you spell that?
So we can get it right.

188
Okay, it's P as in Phoebe.
H as in Heebie.

189
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

190
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate."

191
Great.
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.

192
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks, you guys.

193
Bye.

194
So it seems like
you have a lot of friends.

195
- Yeah.
- Who would you say is your best friend?

196
How come you have two?

197
Well, this one's for you.

198
- Get out.
- No, I can't.

199
No, no. Listen,
I know how much this means to you.

200
And I also know this is about
more than jewelry.

201
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

202
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so.

203
Check it out. We're bracelet buddies.

204
That's what they'll call us.

205
- Oh, Joey. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

206
No, but look.
Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.

207
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.

208
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

209
- Ha.
- Yeah.

210
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

211
Whoo! Ha, ha.

212
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez.

213
I've been feeling guilty about this.
I wanna be a good friend...

214
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

215
Yeah, uh...

216
Wow.

217
You are a good friend.

218
Of course, the audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

219
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

220
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

221
And they're off. Oh.

222
Get your foot off my contestant.
Judge.

223
- Judge rules: No violation.
- Oh.

224
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter.
- No. Wait, that's not a Nutter Butter.

225
- That's an old wonton.
- Judge rules: Nutter Butter.

226
- Oh. Tough call.
- Yeah.

227
I had seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

228
Wait a minute. I saw that.
On the Discovery Channel.

229
Yeah, about jellyfish, and how if you...

230
Ew. You peed on yourself?

231
- Ew.
- You can't say that. You don't know.

232
I mean, I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

233
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

234
O

235
GROUP
Ew.

236
That's right, I stepped up.

237
She's my friend and she needed help.

238
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

239
Uh, nope. No best friend.

240
No, just a lot of close friends. Yeah.

241
So, uh, now back to the show.

242
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

243
Really? Me?

244
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

245
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

246
Now, off the record, you're not...

247
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

248
At first, I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too. Check it out.

249
It's got compartments for all your stuff:
your wallet, your keys, your address book.

250
Your makeup.

251
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

252
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

253
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face to face.

254
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

255
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

256
I'd prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.

257
You know, when we talked about
face to face...

258
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

259
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

260
Check it out.

261
Huh?

262
- How much of a man am I?
- Wow.

263
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

264
You're turning into a woman.

265
No, I'm not. Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

266
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

267
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

268
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

269
- Great nap.
- It really was.

270
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

271
Uh, but I have a number
of close friends who are.

272
So let's talk about women.

273
I'm sure our female readers will be
interested to know about your romantic life.

274
Oh, what I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

275
"Hey. How you doing?"

276
Oh, please.

277
Hey. How you doing?

278
Hey. How you doing?

279
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

280
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

281
Hey, would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

282
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God. Jill.

283
- Oh, my God. Rachel.
- Oh, hi.

284
- Oh, my God. Introduce us.
- Well, this is Chandler.

285
- Hi.
- You know Monica and Ross.

286
- Hi.
- And that's Phoebe. And that's Joey.

287
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

288
You're a really nice guy...

289
...and I'm happy to be
your roommate and your friend.

290
I'm just... You know,
I just don't feel that way about you.

291
Oh, I see what happened. Ha, ha.

292
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

293
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

294
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

295
How you doing?

296
I'm okay.

297
What? Oh, dear God.

298
Not much to tell there. I'm really shy.

299
So that's it. I guess that's all I need.

300
Thank you so much.

301
I think they will be running this
in the beginning of next month.

302
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

303
- Bye.
'Bye-bye.

304
- I did it.
- Amazing.

305
Oh, wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

306
Other than Days of Our Lives,
what's your favorite soap opera?

307
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

308
Thank you.
The readers at Soap Opera Digest...

309
...will be happy to learn that.

310
Oh. Good enough.

311
So close.

312
Wow, I can't believe
they didn't put in the part...

313
...where you said you didn't
watch soap operas.

314
Yeah, I called the lady about that.
I told her I was joking.

315
She was pretty nice about it.

316
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit. Yeah.

317
Wow.
This picture of you sure is steamy.

318
Oh, yeah, that's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

319
Did you just wink at me?

320
Hey, you're the one
who loves the picture.

﻿1
Listen, you know what? Sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

2
We did not take a bag
of Meshugga Nuts from the minibar.

3
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
- Hey.
- Oh.

5
- Joey, were you in our room last night?
- No.

6
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

7
- Hi, we're checking out of the bridal suite.
- That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

8
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

9
And I'm the happiest guy
in the world.

10
Come on, honey. Don't be upset.
We have so much to look forward to.

11
Yeah, right.

12
- The honeymoon.
- That's not till Thursday.

13
- The wedding pictures.
- Those won't be ready weeks.

14
- Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
- That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!

15
I'll tell you what. I will go get them developed,
and you can go home.

16
- What? What did you take a picture of?
- Nothing. It was something.

17
Okay, Ross has the cameras.
Is he checked out yet?

18
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

19
- And he has a good 11 minutes left.
- So?

20
So Ross has never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

21
Yeah, one time when we were dating...

22
...we got a late checkout, he got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

23
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

24
Okay, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras,
and get them developed.

25
Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!

26
- Here's a copy of your bill.
- Oh, thanks.

27
Champagne, strawberries...

28
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

29
Yeah, that's sad.

30
Meshugga Nut?

31
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

33
- Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
- Yeah, but you don't need...

34
- What is this?
- Thread.

35
Score!

36
- Where are the disposable cameras?
- What disposable cameras?

37
Last night I asked you to take them.

38
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...

39
Yeah, you came up to me
and asked me for a favor.

40
And then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

41
Then you said, "Why do they call it a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian?"

42
- Yeah, then you did that.
- So you don't have the cameras?

43
- No, sorry.
- So what? What?

44
- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
- I'm sure they're here somewhere.

45
I'll help you look.

46
- Great.
- In three minutes.

47
- Hey
- Hey.

48
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

49
No.

50
They're calling out to me.

51
This little guy even crawled
up in my lap.

52
Come on, Chandler wouldn't mind
if I opened just one present.

53
What do you think it is?

54
A mirror that when you look into it,
you see yourself as an old woman.

55
A tiny salt shaker!

56
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

57
Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.

58
Oh, yeah.

59
I'm just gonna wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

60
- Okay.
- Whoo!

61
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

62
So I guess it may just count as half a present.
What do you think?

63
Well, I guess it's okay to open one more
if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.

64
Or this one!

65
Hi.

66
- How you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
- Shh! The guys don't know yet, do they?

67
No. Joey and Ross don't know anything,
and Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

68
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

69
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling,
or offered to carry my bags.

70
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

71
After you, of course.

72
Don't worry. I promise that you will only have
to be pregnant a few more hours.

73
I'm going to tell the father today.

74
Is it someone in this building?
That tall guy from the first floor?

75
- Eww! No!
- What? I think he's cute.

76
- Well, then you have his baby.
- Believe me, I'm trying.

77
Wow. It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today...

78
...and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

79
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

80
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

81
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

82
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty big news.
- Pretty big? It's huge!

83
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's walking around thinking:

84
"I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!"

85
Then, bam!
He's a father, everything's different.

86
Well, it's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

87
Then he still has this huge decision
to make. Now he's thinking:

88
"Do I want to be a dad?"
Then, bam!

89
- What was that "bam"?
- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.

90
- Hi.
- Hey.

91
Joey, what would you do if someone
you slept with told you she was pregnant?

92
Who called here?

93
Did she sound blond? Any accent?
I gotta make a call.

94
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

95
Oh, Joey! Joey! It's not you!
You didn't get anyone pregnant.

96
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

97
Is somebody pregnant?

98
Oh, yeah! That's me.

99
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

100
Yes, I am.

101
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

102
- Wait, who's the father?
- You don't know him.

103
He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby.

104
Who is this guy? Who is he?
Because I'll track him down and kick his ass!

105
- David Linn.
- David Linn!

106
David Linn! David Linn!

107
- Who's David Linn?
- Some guy from my gym. A little annoying.

108
- Chandler?
- Hey. Did you find the cameras?

109
No. Did you?

110
Yes, that's why I'm under the table.
Celebrating.

111
I checked in the lost and found.

112
I talked to the manager.
No one's turned them in.

113
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that will cheer Monica up. She's depressed.

114
You guys just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

115
All my energy is going into
not asking that question.

116
- I can't believe I screwed this up!
- I'm sorry, man.

117
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

118
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed up people.

119
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

120
No, we buy more of these at the gift shop,
throw our tuxes on and take a few pictures.

121
All have to do is make sure
not to get people's faces.

122
Are you serious?

123
I'm just thinking about your new bride.

124
Okay? Do you really want to start your
life together by letting her down?

125
Marriage advice? Really?

126
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

127
- Aren't these the same flowers?
- I don't know. Monica picked them.

128
- The chairs?
- Those too.

129
- The place settings?
- Her.

130
- What did you do?
- I was in charge of the cameras.

131
- Gift shop?
- Mm.

132
Hey.

133
- Did you do it yet?
- Not yet.

134
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

135
- Is it Gunther?
- No...

136
- It's not Gunther!
- Thank God. That hair on a baby?

137
The father is not here. I haven't
told him, and I don't think I can now.

138
- Why not?
- Now let me think.

139
I was walking down the street, thinking, "I'm
gonna tell the father today." And then, bam!

140
Bus?

141
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

142
- But it is huge.
- I know.

143
But I was just thinking
about how huge it was for me.

144
I didn't go to how huge
this is gonna be for the father.

145
You're thinking about this
way too much.

146
Just tell him and get it over with.

147
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

148
Oh, mother of...!

149
See?

150
- Ooh. Are we opening presents?
- No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

151
Joey, I am out of control!

152
You have to do me a favor.

153
No matter what I say, no matter what I do,
please do not let me open another present.

154
- Okay?
- Okay.

155
- Give me one more.
- Okay.

156
- Hey.
- Oh, good. You're here. Pheebs? Listen...

157
- Sit down, I got something I want to say.
- All right.

158
Um...

159
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

160
Now, I always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

161
So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

162
Oh, my God!

163
- Joey!
- Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

164
- You can't marry him!
- Hey, lady, your day's over, it's my turn.

165
- Phoebe!
- What? Why can't she marry me?

166
I can and I will.

167
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant, okay.

168
- Oh, my God!
- Hey.

169
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

170
It's Joey!

171
I love you.

172
I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?

173
- Yeah.
- Who's the father?

174
We don't know.

175
- I wonder if it's that dude.
- There's a dude?

176
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

177
A month ago this guy spent the night.
I didn't see who it was, but...

178
Was that story over?

179
The guy left this.

180
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

181
People have got
to finish their stories.

182
- Excuse me. Could you take a picture of us?
- Oh. Of course.

183
- Would you take one of us?
- Uh. Yeah, sure.

184
Click.

185
- It didn't click.
- I heard it.

186
- But there was no flash.
- Why won't you take our picture?

187
Yeah, I'll take your picture.

188
- Your finger was covering the lens.
- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here!

189
Look, I feel really bad about how
I freaked you out before...

190
...so I called the father
and asked him to meet you here. Go!

191
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

192
I may play the fool at times...

193
...but I'm more than a pretty blond
with an ass that won't quit.

194
I believe this belongs to the father
of your baby.

195
Oh, God.

196
- Oh. He's in there right now?
- Uh-huh.

197
You can turn around, or you can go in there
and rip the Band-Aid off.

198
What do you wanna do?

199
- Let's rip.
- Really? Are you sure?

200
- Phoebe!
- Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

201
Hey, Rach.

202
Go on-stage. I'll get a picture
of you doing the speech.

203
Okay. Okay.

204
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

205
Your car is about to be towed.

206
That's my car!

207
- A '95 LeSabre?
- Yes.

208
- A green LeSabre?
- Yes!

209
- I'm sorry, I meant blue.
- Yes, green-blue.

210
Well, go. Go move it!

211
- Okay. Ready for the last picture?
- Yeah.

212
Get ready to run.

213
Congratulations on your wedding.

214
So, what's this about?

215
Rachel has something
that she wants to tell you.

216
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

217
No, this is my red sweater.

218
Oh, no.

219
Could I get anyone a coffee?

220
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

221
What's going on?

222
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

223
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

224
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

225
I know we broke up because you thought
I wasn't mature enough...

226
...but I've really grown up.
And I think we should get back together.

227
It's just not the right time.

228
- It is the right time.
- Okay.

229
- I'm ready for more.
- Tag.

230
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

231
- I'm having a baby.
- Oh.

232
- You can go.
- Thank you.

233
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

234
- You opened them all?
- I know, I am a terrible person.

235
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

236
- Hey! You got my parents' gift.
- Yeah. What is that?

237
I don't know.
I think it does something to salami.

238
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Yeah. What did Tag say?

239
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

240
I do, Rach. I do.
And I'm so happy for you.

241
Oh. Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

242
So are you ever gonna tell
whoever it is?

243
I will, I'm just not up for it tonight.

244
Hey, Rach, listen. No matter what he says,
you're not gonna be alone.

245
- I'm not?
- No.

246
Listen, I, uh...

247
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

248
Aww.

249
I've always felt like
you and I have this special bond.

250
- Rachel Green, will you marry me?
- What?

251
- What?
- What?!

252
- Pheebs, give me the ring back.
- No!

253
Joey, you're so sweet.
You are so, so sweet, honey.

254
But I'm not looking for a husband.

255
I understand.

256
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

257
I can't say that didn't hurt.

258
- But I'll take you back, Joey.
- About that, I...

259
- Ohh, a Salami Buddy!
- There you go!

260
- We're back!
- Great.

261
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

262
- It's picture time.
- You're gonna love these.

263
Here's a picture of Ross.

264
And that's me.

265
And that's me and Ross.

266
Aww. And here's our first kiss
as a married couple.

267
Wow. That is a great picture.

268
Yeah. And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

269
Huh. Didn't see that coming.

270
Okay, so this isn't
the picture of our first kiss...

271
...but it is a picture of my first kiss
with this lady.

272
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need...

273
I'll take the real pictures
to them developed.

274
- That'd be a good idea.
- Okay.

275
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

276
You kissed another woman?

277
- Call it even?
- Okay.

278
- Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
- You stole those from that wedding?

279
No, the hotel lobby. They think
they can charge me for some dirty movie...

280
...and a bag of Meshugga Nuts
they got another thing coming!

281
Hey, my sweater!

282
I've been looking for this for like a month.

283
Oh, my God!

284
Oh, my God!

285
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. Long time no see.

286
- Like your sweater.
- Oh. Hey. Right back at you.

287
- It's crazy about Rachel.
- Yeah. Well, she's one crazy lady.

288
- So whose is it?
- Um, I don't know, some Italian guy.

289
Come on, read your own label.
See you later.

290
- Okay.
- He is so weird.

﻿1
- Hi.
- Hey.

2
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
About 20. A couple people from work
who had something else to do.

4
Also, your sisters called,
neither can make it.

5
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event...

6
...where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

7
Well, I don't care.
As long as my mom's here.

8
- Oh, my God. Your mother.
- What, my mom's not gonna be here?

9
Well, given that we forgot to invite her...

10
...it would be an awfully big coincidence
if she was.

11
Oh, my God.

12
Well, it wasn't my fault.
Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.

13
Well, I don't have a mother.
So often I forget other people...

14
Oh, give it a rest.

15
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

16
No.

17
Neither is mine.

18
You know what? Don't worry.

19
Okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

20
Please make sure she comes.
It's really important to me. It's my mom.

21
- I know. What's her number?
- I don't know.

22
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

23
Wait a minute. If you're in charge
of invitations, why am I calling her?

24
Hello, Mrs. Green.
Hi, uh, it's Monica Geller.

25
- Oh, hello, Monica.
- Hi.

26
Um, I know this is last-minute, but we've
decided to throw an impromptu...

27
- ...baby shower for Rachel today.
- I know. My daughters told me about it...

28
...when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

29
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- For what, dear?

30
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

31
Oh, my God. My ass is sweating.

32
Please, please, can you come?
It's today at 4.

33
- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.
- Thank you.

34
- Isn't it at 3?
- Son of a bitch.

35
- Hey, Joe. Wanna shoot some hoops?
- Hey.

36
No, I can't go, I'm practicing. I got an
audition to be the host of a game show.

37
- Cool.
- Great.

38
Yeah, and if I get it, by day,
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

39
But by night, I'll be Joey Tribbiani.

40
You'll be perfect for this.
That's already your name.

41
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't even understand the game.

42
Do you want some help?

43
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants.

44
Awesome.

45
Okay, I guess we can lose
to junior-high girls some other time.

46
- All right. Let's play Bamboozled.
- Bamboozled?

47
Isn't that a cool name?

48
- Yeah.
- No.

49
All right. Uh, okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

50
Why don't you tell us a little bit
about yourself, Ross?

51
Well, uh, I'm a paleontologist.
Um, I live in New York.

52
I have a son, Ben. Uh, hi, Ben. And, uh...

53
I said a little bit, Ross.
Now, how about you, Chandler?

54
Well, Joey, I'm a headhunter.
I hook up out-of-work Soviet scientists...

55
...with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

56
Excellent. Let's play Bamboozled.
Chandler, you'll go first.

57
- What is the capital of Colombia?
- Bogoté.

58
It's Bogoda, but close enough.

59
Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

60
- What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
- I should know that.

61
Let's see.
Just one moment, please, um...

62
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines whether you go higher or lower.

63
Higher or lower than what?

64
- This is embarrassing.
- Can you believe how lame this is?

65
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

66
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

67
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is totally inappropriate.

68
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

69
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

70
Yes, thank you so much.
And again, we're so sorry.

71
We could not feel worse about it.

72
Try.

73
There's my little girl.

74
- She's still mad.
- Yeah, I know.

75
Isn't it great? One less person
we have to make small talk with.

76
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

77
Look, we've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

78
I know you hate it when people
are mad at you...

79
...but, you know,
you just have to be okay with it.

80
Okay. I can do that. Heh.

81
- I gotta go powder my ass.
- Oh.

82
Look at that face.
Just like when you were in high school.

83
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble.

84
- Come on, let's get some tea.
- Okay.

85
Ooh, my. Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

86
Now, have you picked your nanny yet?

87
I don't want you to just use
your housekeeper...

88
...because it'll just split her focus.

89
Oh. Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And, uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.

90
It's like you're a cave person.

91
Rachel, you must get a nanny.

92
You don't know how overwhelming
this is gonna be.

93
When you were a baby,
I had full-time help. I had Mrs. K.

94
Mrs. K. Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

95
I actually think
I remember some of it:

96
- Such a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

97
Well, however great she was,
I just can't afford that.

98
- Oh, Rachel.
- What?

99
I just had the greatest idea.
I'm gonna come live with you.

100
What? What?

101
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

102
Aw, look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

103
Yes, yes, I do.

104
All right, Ross, you're in the lead.

105
Would you like to take another question,
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

106
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey. Uh...

107
I'll take another question.

108
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.

109
It's okay. I'm ready.

110
No, dude, you gotta hold your breath
till you're ready to answer the question.

111
- It's part of the game.
- This is ridiculous. He's not gonna hold...

112
Okay. What do you have a fear of
if you suffer from this phobia? Triska...

113
Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris...

114
Seriously, look at this thing, Chandler.
How do you say that?

115
- Let me see that.
- This one right here.

116
- Triskaidekaphobia.
- Fear of Triscuits.

117
- No. No. Fear of the number 13.
- Fear of Triscuits?

118
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

119
All right, Chandler, you're up.

120
Wait a minute. I believe I'm entitled
to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.

121
- This game makes no sense.
- You're just upset because you're losing.

122
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

123
All right. Chandler, you can either
spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.

124
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, uh, I don't care.

125
You must choose, Mr. Bing.

126
- Either. It makes no difference.
- Choose, you jackass.

127
- I'll take a card.
- Okay, you picked the Gimme Card.

128
- You get all of Ross' points.
- What?

129
This game is kind of fun.

130
You don't think it's a little crazy
that you get all my points...?

131
I don't think the contestants
are supposed to speak to each other.

132
- Why did you invite my mother?
- What?

133
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.

134
- For how long?
- Eight weeks.

135
I mean, I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

136
I personally would be honored
if she wanted to live with me.

137
She can't hear you.

138
You guys, come on.
What am I gonna do?

139
If you don't want your mother
to move in with you, just tell her.

140
You're right. You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

141
I can tell my mother that I don't want her
to be sleeping on my couch.

142
Oh, my God. She's gonna wanna sleep
in my bed with me. This cannot happen.

143
That's right. That is right.

144
You go over there and tell her
you do not want her to live with you.

145
- Do not take no for an answer.
- Okay.

146
This is great.
Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel.

147
And I'm just gonna swoop in there
and be like the daughter she never had.

148
I have new respect for Chandler.

149
All right, everybody.
It's time to open the presents.

150
Yes, and I think that the first gift
that Rachel opens...

151
...should be from the grandmother
of the baby.

152
Because you're the most important person
in this room. And in the world.

153
Well, um, I don't have a gift because
I wasn't invited until the last minute.

154
But thank you so much, dear,
for bringing that to everybody's attention.

155
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents.

156
- Mom, it's okay that you didn't get a gift.
- Well, I kind of did.

157
- Me. Eight weeks of me.
- Yeah.

158
Okay. See, Mom, the truth is,
I can do this on my own.

159
Sweetheart, I know you're gonna be
a terrific mom.

160
I just think you need a little help,
especially at the beginning.

161
But, Mom, I really know what I'm doing.
I can handle this.

162
Really? Remember Twinkles?

163
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby.

164
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time.

165
You know, you're the glue
holding this whole party together.

166
It's kind of falling apart here.

167
- Ooh, look.
- Wow.

168
This is from your friends at work.

169
Ooh, my gosh. Oh, wow.
Oh, I know what this is.

170
Wait a minute.

171
That can't be right.

172
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

173
Darling, that's a breast pump.

174
Heh. Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

175
Ooh, wow. What's this?

176
- It's a Diaper Genie.
- Oh, it dispenses clean diapers.

177
No, it's where you put dirty ones.

178
Well, that's gross. Why don't you just
take it outside and throw it in a Dumpster?

179
- You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
- What, it goes 10 times a day?

180
What are we feeding this baby,
Indian food?

181
No, dear. That's what babies do.

182
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

183
Plus, what are you planning on doing with
the baby while you trot out to the garbage?

184
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

185
- What? What did I do? What did I do?
- You can't leave a baby alone.

186
Of course, I know that.

187
I mean, of course you never
leave a baby alone. Ha, ha.

188
I mean, it would...
She wouldn't be safe.

189
You know, not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy. Ha, ha.

190
Okay, you know what? Opening the
presents is a little overwhelming right now.

191
So I think, um, I'm just gonna maybe
open them all a little bit later.

192
But thank you all for coming,
and for these beautiful gifts...

193
- ...and this basket is beautiful.
- It's actually a bassinet.

194
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

195
In what John Huston film
would you hear this line:

196
"Badges? We don't need
no stinking badges."

197
- Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
- Correct.

198
There's a possible Backwards Bonus.

199
- Madre Sierra the of Treasure.
- Yes.

200
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
to the Golden Mud Hut, please.

201
- Wise choice. How many rungs?
- Six.

202
- That noise can only mean one thing.
- Hungry Monkey.

203
- I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
- Okay. It's an audio question.

204
Name this television theme song:

205
Oh. Oh, my God. Okay, I know this.
Give me a second.

206
- Tell it to the Time Turtle.
- Shut up.

207
- I Dream of Jeannie.
- Yes. Yes, you're back in the lead.

208
Uh, I'd like to spin the Wheel.

209
Oh, come on.

210
Uh, uh, Super Speedy Speed Round.

211
- Is there a Hopping Bonus?
- Of course.

212
- Who invented bifocals?
- Ben Franklin.

213
Correct. Which monarch
has ruled Great Britain the longest?

214
- Queen Victoria.
- Correct again.

215
But you forgot to switch legs between
questions. So no Hopping Bonus.

216
- Oh! Every time.
- Yeah.

217
- Now over to Chandler.
- I'd like a Google Card.

218
- Are you sure?
- Yes. No. Google.

219
Oh, my God. Congratulations, Ross.
Because, Chandler...

220
- ...you've been Bamboozled.
- No!

221
- Yes!
- This is the best game ever!

222
So, um, you're gonna stay with me
as long as I need you?

223
- Of course I am.
- Mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.

224
I read all kinds of books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

225
But I just didn't think to read the part
about what to do when the baby comes.

226
And, guess what, the baby's coming...

227
...and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

228
Oh, sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

229
- Wait, where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

230
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

231
It is gonna be okay.

232
Worth a shot.

233
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
Why are you all red and sweaty?

235
I just Bamboozled Chandler.

236
Which is not a sexual thing.

237
- Well, that was a quick shower.
- Not if you were here.

238
Wow, looks like we got
a lot of good stuff.

239
We did. But my mom got us
the greatest gift of all.

240
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

241
No. She's going to live with us
for eight weeks.

242
What?

243
Yes. She's gonna help us
take care of the baby. Woo-hoo.

244
You're not serious.

245
I mean, she's a very nice woman...

246
...but there's no way we can take
eight weeks of her.

247
- She'll drive us totally crazy...
- Hi, Ross.

248
Hey, roomie.

249
Hey, Joey, hi, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

250
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

251
And this is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help out with the audition.

252
So let's get the camera rolling.

253
- Righty-0, Ray.
- Whenever you're ready.

254
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled.

255
Erin, you get the first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

256
- Wayne Gretzky.
- Correct.

257
Now, would you like to pick a Wicked
Wango Card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

258
Uh, Joey, didn't your agents
give you the revised rules?

259
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

260
What? Why?

261
Well, the game was too complicated and
research showed people didn't follow it.

262
What's complicated? You spin the Wheel
of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance...

263
...past the Mud Hut through the
Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey.

264
You yank his tail, and boom,
you're in Paradise Pond.

265
Yeah. All that's gone.

266
Um, it's basically just a simple
question-and-answer game now.

267
Well, what's fun about that?

268
You expect me to be the host
of a boring game...

269
...that's just people standing around
answering questions?

270
Well, there'll be women in bikinis
holding up the scores.

271
Let's play Bamboozled.

272
And all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have...

273
...Ross, I thought they might be
more at home in the garage.

274
- Well, we don't have a garage.
- Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

275
You know what, Mrs. Green? Maybe it's
not absolutely vital that you live with us.

276
- Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
- I do. I really do. I don't know anything.

277
I'm sure that's not true.

278
Oh, no? Pheebs, Monica,
do I know anything about babies?

279
- Nope. Not a thing.
- Mm-mm. It's frightening.

280
Well, um, you know what?
Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.

281
I have a son.
His mother and I didn't live together.

282
Whenever he was with me,
I took care of him all the time, by myself.

283
- That's true. You do have another child.
- Yeah.

284
With another woman.

285
Have you no control, Ross?

286
That's a different issue.

287
Um, the point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her...

288
...and bathe her and change her.

289
And more than that,
I want to do all those things.

290
Well, then you don't need me
to live with you.

291
Yes!

292
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

293
You're gonna be a great father.

294
Well, you're gonna be
a wonderful grandma.

295
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

296
Come on, every first-time mother
feels that way.

297
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city...

298
...you were this spoiled,
helpless little girl...

299
...who still used Daddy's credit cards,
remember?

300
I hope you're going somewhere with this.

301
Look at you. You're this big executive.

302
You are much more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

303
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

304
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

305
Thank you.

306
All right, you two. I'm gonna get going.

307
- Oh.
- Oh, no, sweetheart, you stay put.

308
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here.
Which I almost wasn't.

309
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

310
Nothing. You have apologized
to her like a million times.

311
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

312
And don't forget,
you just threw her daughter...

313
...a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.

314
- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
- You know what? You're right.

315
Yeah, I mean, if you wanna
say anything to her, I'd tell her off.

316
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

317
Okay, I will.

318
Mrs. Green?

319
Mrs. Green?

320
It is rude to leave a party
without saying goodbye to the host.

321
And also, when someone
apologizes to you...

322
...the decent thing to do is to accept it.

323
Because what I did to you,
it wasn't on purpose.

324
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

325
- Spiteful?
- That's right.

326
Maybe it's time you took a good,
hard look in the mirror, young lady.

327
Old lady.

328
Lady.

329
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

330
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you. Good day.

331
I can't feel my legs.

332
You were fantastic.
I'm so proud of you.

333
- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
- You should be.

334
- Could you get me something to drink?
- You got it.

335
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry.
I apologize. If you just... Aah!

336
Okay. I bit my tongue.

337
But I'm still really sorry.

338
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You sure?

339
Yes. I've done my studying,
and I really know my stuff.

340
All right, then.

341
Rachel Green, let's play Bamboozled.

342
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bathwater?

343
- Uh, put your elbow in it.
- Excellent.

344
- How do you put a baby down for a nap?
- Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.

345
That's correct.

346
This is an audio question. What do you do
when a baby makes this sound:

347
Uh, check if it's wet,
check if it's hungry, burp it.

348
Excellent. Now, do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

349
- A card. A card. I pick a card.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

350
You've been Bamboozled.
You're gonna be a terrible mother.

351
I've lost sight of why
we're doing this.

﻿1
- Hey, guys. I got some bad news.
- What?

2
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

3
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.

4
Oh, no!

5
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around
and bought all the copies I could find.

6
Man, this is bad.
And I've had my share of bad reviews.

7
I still remember my first good one:

8
"Everything else in this production
of Our Town was simply terrible.

9
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

10
- Hey.
- Hey.

11
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

12
It must be a good review. Is it great?

13
Um...

14
Oh, dear God.

15
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

16
- What about the rest of Manhattan?
- Yeah, they all know.

17
- Oh, my God, this is horrible.
- I'm sorry.

18
I'm so humiliated.

19
But you know what they say,
there is no such thing as bad press.

20
You don't think that, um, "the chef's
mahi-mahi was awful-awful" is bad press?

21
I didn't write it.

22
- God, is he right? Am I awful?
- Oh, no!

23
Hey, Monica, listen to me, okay?

24
I'm not saying this because I'm your friend,
I say it because it's true.

25
Your food is abysmal!

26
- Ross?
- What? What?

27
- I am freaking out!
- Are you?

28
My due date is in one week!

29
- What are you doing up?
- That is seven days.

30
Look, I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after...?

31
No, no, no, no, Ross!

32
Please, come on.
We do not have any big stuff we need.

33
We don't have a changing table.
We do not have a crib.

34
- We do not have a diaper service.
- Funny you should mention diapers.

35
- I'm serious.
- Look. There's nothing to worry about.

36
We have plenty of time.
There's a baby furniture store on West 10th.

37
Tomorrow, we'll go there...

38
- ...and we'll get everything we need. Okay?
- Okay. Thank you. That's great.

39
Wait, where on West 10th?
There's a really cute shoe store...

40
Okay. If, uh... If you're gonna do this...

41
...then I'm gonna go do that, so...

42
- Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
- Yeah.

43
Um, our situation, you know, um,
what we mean to each other...

44
...and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together...

45
Isn't that...? Isn't that weird?

46
Well, uh...

47
- I'm just kidding. You can go pee. Ha, ha.
- Oh...!

48
Hey, I can't remember.
Did we say we were gonna meet here...

49
- ...or at the movie?
- At the movies...

50
- I'll see you there.
- Joey. Now that you're here...?

51
Sure, I can hang out
till I have to meet you.

52
- How come you're not going?
- I've got a job interview to get ready for.

53
- I thought you already have a job.
- And people say you don't pay attention.

54
This is a much better job.
It's vice president of the company...

55
...that does data reconfiguration...

56
...and statistical factoring
and for other companies.

57
- Wow. How do you know how to do that?
- That's what I do now.

58
- Joey? Come taste this.
- What is it?

59
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well...

60
...I'm getting my revenge.

61
You cooked him?

62
No. He teaches a course on food criticism
at The New School.

63
Before we go to the movies, I want
to make him try my bouillabaisse again.

64
Ugh, I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

65
"Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica."'

66
The front page?

67
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

68
Do you want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

69
- Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
- Heh. No, no.

70
- We're not married.
- We are having a baby together...

71
...but we're not involved.

72
I mean, uh, we... We were seeing
each other a while ago...

73
...but then we were just friends,
and then there was one drunken night...

74
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

75
- Why don't you fill out this address card?
- Oh, okay.

76
- I noticed you picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
- Oh, yeah.

77
That's one of the reasons
why we are not a couple.

78
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.

79
Really? That is so cool.

80
Oh, don't get too worked up over it.
It sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.

81
Oh, no. I'm fascinated by paleontology.

82
- Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
- Yeah, heh, I teach it in class.

83
Oh, my God. Standing at a cash register,
I'm holding a credit card, and I'm bored.

84
I love your neighborhood. There's a great
gym around the corner from your building.

85
- That's my gym.
- I could tell you work out.

86
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.

87
I am like Indiana Jones.

88
Hi, Pheebs.

89
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

90
It was great!
We got everything we needed.

91
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

92
Ahem, a whore.

93
- What?
- We were paying for our stuff...

94
...and this sales woman
just started flirting with him.

95
Can you believe that?

96
- Did she know you two weren't married?
- Yeah.

97
Oh, my God. Well, the idea...
A woman flirting with a single man?

98
- We must alert the church elders.
- No.

99
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

100
- Sounds like you're a little jealous.
- No, I'm not.

101
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop...

102
...and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

103
Is that a real place?

104
Are they hiring?

105
- Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.
- Wha...?

106
Hey, Chandler, why so fancy?

107
Well, I got a job interview.
Big deal, too.

108
It's more money. I'd be doing data
reconfiguration and statistical factoring.

109
- I think I know someone who does that.
- Me. I do that.

110
So seriously, do I look okay? I'm nervous.

111
Oh, yeah. You... Really, you look great.

112
You know, just don't get your hopes up.

113
- Why not?
- Well, the interview.

114
- What about it?
- You know.

115
You don't make a very good
first impression.

116
- What?
- Oh, you don't know.

117
- Are you serious?
- Yes. When I first met you, you were like:

118
I was like:

119
Shh!

120
What is it that I do?

121
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,
always making jokes.

122
You just... You come off a little needy.

123
Did you like me when we first met?

124
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.

125
But I am gonna run away from you.

126
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

127
Still?

128
I think the things you said were unfair...

129
...and I would like you to give
my bouillabaisse another chance.

130
I don't see any reason
why I'd do that to myself again.

131
Either eat it or be in it.

132
SP0on?

133
- So, what do you think?
- I'm torn...

134
...between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

135
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

136
Thattagirll Eh? We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

137
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.
Before we start...

138
...can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and béarnaise sauce?

139
- I can.
- Okay, go ahead.

140
Well, um, they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

141
But a béarnaise, um, has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

142
- Ha, ha, very good. What's your name?
- Monica.

143
- Monica, you go to the head of the class!
- Okay!

144
All this stuff takes up a lot of room.

145
Hey, how, uh, serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?

146
My son? Pretty serious.

147
Oh, hey, Katie.
What are you doing here?

148
The delivery went out
and I realized they forgot this.

149
Ah, it must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

150
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

151
Oh.

152
Oh, um, I actually came here
to ask you out.

153
Oh. Wow. Uh, yeah, that sounds great.

154
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

155
Uh, I'm free now.
You want to grab some coffee...?

156
- Sure.
- Horny bitch.

157
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

158
No, you're a horny bitch!

159
So you guys go, have a really good time.

160
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And, uh, my whip.

161
You know, because of Indiana Jones.

162
Not because I'm into S&M.

163
I'm not into anything weird,
you know? Heh.

164
Just normal sex.

165
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

166
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

167
Are you okay with this?

168
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

169
- Okay. Heh.
- Yeah.

170
It was nice to see you.

171
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

172
- Ah, heh.
- Although you missed a button.

173
Oh, actually, I, um...

174
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

175
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?

176
Ugh, it's okay. You calm down
after a while...

177
...and then people can see
how sweet and wonderful you are.

178
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview's gonna last a couple of weeks.

179
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.

180
- How long before you have to leave?
- An hour.

181
- I can't help you.
- Phoebe...

182
We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

183
- Okay.
- Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.

184
- Chandler Bing.
- Oh, Bing.

185
- What an unusual name.
- Well, you should meet my Uncle Bada.

186
I'll let myself out.

187
H93'-

188
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

189
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

190
- And the cream?
- Cheese makes me thirsty.

191
- Okay. Let's move on.
- All right.

192
Oh. Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

193
My God! This is absolutely amazing!
You've never made this before?

194
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

195
I had to ask what it was called
when the water makes those bubbles.

196
Wow. Hats off to the chef.

197
I'm sorry, your mouth was full.
I didn't hear what you said.

198
- Hats off to who now?
- The chef!

199
Heh, that's right!

200
I think you'll find if I work here
that I don't micromanage.

201
I don't shy away from delegating.

202
Mm-hm. That's good to know. But let's
stop focusing on what you don't do...

203
...and focus on what you do do.

204
What I do do...

205
...is manage to, uh,
create an atmosphere of support...

206
...for the people working with me.

207
I see. Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

208
- Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
- Oh, you gotta go!

209
- Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
- Really?

210
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

211
Ah, Monica, my star student.

212
Heh. You called me that before...

213
...so I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of foil.

214
Now, no pressure. If you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

215
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

216
Wow, a star!

217
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

218
- Okay, Joey, you're up next.
- Yeah.

219
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

220
You get an A.

221
I got an A? In school?
Hey, I'm a dork!

222
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

223
- I think you should give him your star.
- Excuse me?

224
- He doesn't even know what he's doing.
- We're all beginners.

225
- Nobody knows what they're doing.
- I do. I'm a professional chef!

226
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.

227
What are you doing
taking Introduction to Cooking?

228
Yeah!

229
I'm sorry. It's just that, um,
I cook at this restaurant, Allessandrds...

230
...and, um, I just got
a really bad review.

231
- Oh, Allessandro's? I love that place!
- You do?

232
Yes, you're an excellent chef.
As a person you're a little...

233
- Oh, totally crazy, but you liked the food?
- Ha, ha. Very much.

234
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

235
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

236
Actually, did either of you
pay for this class?

237
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

238
Also, I was the point person
on my company's transition...

239
...from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

240
- You must have had your hands full.
- That I did. That I did.

241
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

242
My duties?

243
All right.

244
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

245
- I see.
- But there'll be 30 people under you...

246
...so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

247
- Good to know.
- We could go into detail...

248
No, don't, I beg of you.

249
All right, then. We'll have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

250
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

251
- Really?
- Absolutely.

252
- You can relax. You did great.
- I gotta say, thank you.

253
I was really nervous. I'm told I come on
too strongly, too many jokes.

254
And then it was really hard
to side step that "duty" thing.

255
Duties?

256
Doodies?

257
Poo?

258
Poo?

259
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

260
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy in the hall.

261
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

262
Poo?

263
I'll look forward to your call.

264
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

265
- You're back from your date.
- How are you?

266
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

267
Uh, it was fun. We just had coffee.

268
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

269
Heh, what's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

270
No. No, she was nice.

271
I mean, she was a little slutty,
but who isn't?

272
Well, I liked her.

273
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you Indiana Jones.

274
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

275
No. It's just that... Katie bothered me.

276
Why? What was wrong with her?

277
Ugh, there was nothing wrong with her.
All right? She was perfectly lovely.

278
- Okay. So, what's the matter?
- I don't want you to date her.

279
Heh, what? Why? What, are you jealous?

280
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

281
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

282
I know it's a terrible thing to even think this
and it's inappropriate...

283
...but I want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

284
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.

285
- Okay.
- What?

286
I won't date. I'll, uh...

287
I'll be here with you all the time.

288
Really?

289
But I'm being so unreasonable.

290
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

291
Oh...

292
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

293
You feel better?

294
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder...

295
...and now I have to pee. Sorry.

296
- Okay.
- Rash?

297
- Yeah?
- Just one thing. Um...

298
We live together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.

299
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

300
Wow. I don't know, maybe...

301
Oh, Rach,
I was just messing around. Heh.

302
- Like you did when I had to pee?
- Oh! Ha! I knew that.

303
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

304
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed...

305
- No, no, no, no. No! It's just... Ha!
- ...like you actually...

306
That's just because
I'm such a good messer!

307
Ah! Ah, heh.

308
- Rash?
- Yeah?

309
- The bathroom?
- Right.

310
I had a great time. I learned how to bake,
ate great food.

311
The first A I've gotten since 7th grade
and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher.

312
- Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
- Yeah.

313
Wanna feel good about yourself?

314
- What the hell!
- Okay.

315
All right, let's start with some basics.

316
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

317
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.

﻿1
What are you looking at?

2
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

3
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

6
- I cannot wait to see this.
- It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
- I started that!
- I thought I did!

8
I just talked to my agent...

9
...and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

10
- Will we take a limo?
- Sure!

11
I love taking limos when nobody died.

12
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

14
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

15
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

16
I'm looking forward
to the next part...

17
...but I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

18
That's right. Still no baby.

19
Come on, people, make some room.

20
Uh, sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

21
You.

22
Like you haven't done enough.

23
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

24
I wish I were a sea horse.

25
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

26
And then also, um,
I'd be far away in the sea.

27
God.

28
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

29
I know. I remember toward the end...

30
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

31
Oh...

32
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

33
Let's.

34
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

35
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

36
- What are you doing here?
- They sent me home from work.

37
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

38
You know what? Screw them!

39
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

40
Or you could do volunteer work.

41
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

42
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

43
- You told me I could have six tickets.
- I sold four on eBay.

44
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

45
So that's it?
I only get to bring one guest?

46
Yeah. What time do you
want to pick me up?

47
Hello?

48
You hear that?
I only get one extra ticket.

49
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

50
- What about me?
- You said you didn't want to go.

51
I would still like
to be acknowledged.

52
- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
- Definitely not invisible.

53
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

54
- You snooze, you lose.
- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

55
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

56
And, Joey, not that this should, uh, affect
you at all, but, um, if you pick me...

57
...I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress out down to here.

58
- I haven't seen this dress.
- Star in a movie.

59
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

60
Phoebe.Phoebe.Phoebe.

61
Well, uh...

62
I think I want to take Chandler.

63
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

64
- You want to take me?
- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

65
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

66
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

67
This will be my way
of paying you back.

68
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

69
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

70
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

71
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

72
He read lines with me.
He went with me on auditions.

73
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts.

74
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

75
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

76
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

77
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

78
- I'm gonna go shave. Ahem.
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go, uh, spit.

79
Ugh, I have to pee.

80
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

81
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just...

82
...Out of her.

83
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

84
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

85
Hmm. Care to make it interesting?

86
- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
- You're on.

87
- Okay, how much?
- One hundred thousand dollars.

88
- How about 50 bucks?
- I'll call Zurich and move some money.

89
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

90
Ahem, no one's here.

91
Oh, damn it.

92
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

93
- A little tall.
- What?

94
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

95
There you go.

96
It's just so glamorous.

97
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

98
And you're still pregnant.

99
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

100
- You know what? You look great.
- Aw.

101
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

102
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

103
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

104
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

105
All right, stop it.

106
- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
- Fine.

107
Okay.

108
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp right there?

109
- Rachel here? We have an appointment.
- In the bathroom.

110
- Rach, we gotta go.
- In a minute!

111
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

112
All right, all right, let's go.

113
Uh, do you want to go change first?

114
The doctor's keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry...

115
- No, I'm fine.
- You don't think that's inappropriate?

116
- What?
- Good God, man. Don't anger it.

117
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am...

118
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

119
Uh-uh, pal! Don't call me "Mommy."

120
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

121
I'm actually with her on this one.

122
I thought I knew who the enemy was...

123
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

124
I'm fighting for every
man in the 82nd Ground Division.

125
- Ross?
- Yeah?

126
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

127
- When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
- Mm-hm?

128
...were you this irritating?

129
- Wow.
- Excuse me?

130
Uh, nothing. You're just, uh...

131
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

132
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

133
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

134
Okay.

135
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

136
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows...

137
...how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

138
- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
- Hello.

139
You're nice to her.

140
She has the drugs.

141
- We'll do a quick check.
- Okay.

142
- Eight days late, huh?
- Yeah.

143
You must be getting uncomfortable.

144
Yeah, just a tad.

145
You're 80 percent effaced.
You're on your way. It still could last a while.

146
- There are ways to help things along.
- Do them!

147
Actually, they're things
you can do. Home remedies.

148
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

149
- Well, we are ready to try anything.
- There's an herbal tea you can drink.

150
Okay.

151
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

152
We will do all of those.

153
- Taking a long walk.
- Good. Done.

154
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

155
You've got to be kidding me.

156
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

157
- You liked it'? You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah!

158
- Well, which part exactly?
- The whole thing! Here we go!

159
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

160
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

161
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

162
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

163
You fell asleep!

164
There was no kangaroo!
They didn't take any of my suggestions!

165
- Thanks for coming. See you later.
- Don't go. I'm so sorry.

166
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

167
Or call an ambulance!

168
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

169
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

170
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

171
We tried them all.

172
We went for a walk, uh, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

173
There is one thing we didn't try.

174
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

175
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today...

176
...I think you should do it.

177
- It's sex.
- Do it!

178
- Monica.
- It's been a really long time for you.

179
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

180
Oh, I don't know about that.

181
I think if the two of you had sex,
the repercussions would be catastrophic.

182
All right, let's be practical.

183
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

184
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

185
Monica, what is the matter with you?

186
- I just want the baby to be born today.
- Why today?

187
Okay, fine.

188
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

189
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

190
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

191
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

192
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

193
Can I get some of that action?

194
I'm betting against all of you?

195
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

196
Okay.

197
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

198
Where have you been?
I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.

199
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

200
I'm so sorry.

201
The reason I came over is
to settle things between us.

202
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

203
- So how much do I owe you?
- What?

204
- I don't want to owe you anything.
- You don't owe me.

205
- I don't want your...
- Ah, ah, ah. We're doing this!

206
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

207
- I don't know, uh, $500.
- Okay, $500. What else?

208
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

209
Okay, so that's another 500.
That's 500 and 500. That's...

210
- You want a calculator?
- Please.

211
Here.

212
Oh.

213
All right, what else?

214
Well, uh, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes...

215
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

216
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

217
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

218
What the hell are you talking about?

219
The South will rise again, man.

220
- Yes, money well-spent.
- Yeah.

221
Okay, what else? Rent.

222
Uh, two, three years of rent,
utilities, food...

223
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for...

224
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

225
How do you clear this thing?

226
Finish your enchilada.

227
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

228
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

229
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

230
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

231
- I am feeling nothing.
- Oh...

232
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that...

233
...really makes me want
to have sex with you.

234
- Stop it.
- Come on! Why are we wasting time?

235
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

236
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

237
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

238
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

239
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

240
Make love'? What are you, a girl?

241
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

242
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

243
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

244
I love when you talk dirty to me.

245
Oh, I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

246
Oh, oh. Whoops.

247
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

248
Let me just bend over and get it.

249
Oh, God!

250
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

251
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

252
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

253
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

254
- You know what?
- What?

255
Forget it.

256
What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?

257
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

258
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

259
I You'd think the jalapeño would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

260
That's not enough...
What are you doing?

261
I'm getting that baby out of you!

262
- Oh, God!
- I know.

263
Oh, no, no, no.

264
I think my water just broke.

265
I am good!

266
Okay, I got the pillow. Uh, I got the bag.

267
- You got the keys?
- I got the keys. Okay.

268
- Hey.
- Yeah?

269
We're having a baby.

270
I didn't, uh, have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time...?

271
- Not so much.
- Okay, let's go.

272
- Two hundred.
- Thank you.

273
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

274
Okay.

275
Hello?

276
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay.

277
I guess we could bet one more time.

278
- Is Rachel having the baby?
- How did you know that?

279
- Joey! Chandler! It's time!
- They're at the coffee house.

280
You know everything!

281
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

282
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

283
- We know it's a girl.
- I'll give you really good odds.

﻿1
All right!

2
Yes! From home to the hospital
in seven minutes!

3
Yes. The hard part is truly over.

4
We're off to a great start, aren't we?

5
I knew I'd get here fast,
but this has to be a record!

6
- Oh, you made it!
- Hi.

7
- How the hell did you beat us here?
- We took a cab. Did you walk?

8
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs...

9
- Hi.
- Hey, you made it!

10
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

11
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.

12
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Green.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.

13
We have a semi-private
labor room waiting...

14
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

15
Yes, I see that here.
We can't guarantee a private room.

16
- Currently, they're all unavailable.
- Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

18
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
Yeah?

20
- Give her some money.
- I really think they're out of rooms.

21
They're saving them for important
people! What if I was the president?

22
We'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

23
Okay.

24
Say, would you mind checking again?

25
See if any, uh, private rooms
may have opened up?

26
This is a hospital.

27
You know what?
I don't really care for your tone.

28
This is not the only hospital in the city.
We have no problem... Whoa. Oh, gosh!

29
- What, what?
- Contraction! Ow! Ow!

30
- Oh!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ooh, ooh.

31
- Like to see a semi-private room?
- Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

32
You're 2 centimeters dilated.
We need to get to 10.

33
- It will be a while.
- Oh, okay.

34
- I'll be back in an hour to check on you.
- Thank you.

35
- I guess we have some time to kill.
- Yeah, guess so.

36
- Oh, check these out.
- Oh.

37
Never done this before.

38
Yeah, well, it looks great.

39
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to...

40
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

41
- Not at all. Marc Horger. My wife, Julie.
- Don't worry about it.

42
- Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
- Oh, hi, Rachel.

43
- Is this your first?
- It is.

44
- Well, little Jamie here is our third.
- Wow.

45
So if you have any questions,
just holler.

46
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

47
- Let me give you guys some privacy.
- Nonsense. We're all in this together.

48
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

49
- I think we're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah.

50
- Oh, okay, I guess.
- Hey, smile!

51
- No.
- I really don't want any...

52
Oh, thank you.

53
Oh, Ross.
Here comes another contraction.

54
- Ooh, ooh, ooh...
- Okay, just breathe...

55
- Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
- Oh, my God!

56
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, oh, oh.

57
- Hey, look at this. Here you go!
- Oh, no!

58
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

59
Ugh, the miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

60
- Hey, you wanna see something?
- Sure. What?

61
This will be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

62
- Honey?
- Yeah?

63
Listen, uh, I've been doing
some thinking...

64
...and I don't know whether
it's because we're here...

65
...or Rachel's giving birth...

66
...but, um, I think we should
try to have a baby.

67
Okay.

68
What's that now?

69
Okay. I've been thinking about it too.
I think we're ready.

70
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby?

71
Oh, this is fun.

72
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

73
You said you were ready.

74
I was screwing with you to get
your voice high and weird...

75
...like mine is now!

76
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid forever?

77
Okay, just back oh', mister!

78
Because I am ready to have a baby.

79
I just want Joey to be the father.

80
- What? Are you crazy?
- Right there! That's all I wanted!

81
I'm sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

82
Oh, that's very...
Really, very, very okay.

83
Julie's cervix is dilated 7 centimeters.
That's about four fingers!

84
- Doctor let me feel it.
- Have you felt Rachel's?

85
- No, I don't...
- We won't be doing that.

86
Well, you could feel Rachel's,
then feel mine to compare.

87
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes! Thank you!

88
- No, no...
- Later.

89
- You can't leave me with them.
- Sorry.

90
No, Ross, Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

91
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.

92
- I'm coming back later with your father.
- Oh, good.

93
- I need to talk to you before the birth.
- Okay. What's up?

94
I brought something
that I want to give you.

95
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

96
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

97
Your grandma's engagement ring,
I want you to give it to Rachel.

98
- Mom, no. Come on. Thank you...
- Just hear me out...

99
No! Okay? We're not getting
married because she's pregnant.

100
Honestly, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

101
A child should have a family.

102
I can't deal with this now. I'm sorry.

103
Think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.

104
Give me that.

105
- Hi, dear.
- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

106
Ross, get in here!

107
She dragged me out of the labor room
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

108
Yeah.

109
- Why aren't you with Rachel?
- Are you kidding?

110
We're not gonna be together
because we're having a baby.

111
It seems you belong together.

112
I can't deal with this right now.
I have to go have a baby.

113
Right. And with who again?

114
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

115
I know.

116
She's like the perfect woman.
I know she turned me down...

117
...but if she wanted to be with me,
I would take her in my arms and...

118
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while.

119
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
- Who's that?
- New people.

121
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

122
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

123
After you left, they wheeled her off.

124
Not before she gave me a nice, juicy
shot of little Jamie, crowning away.

125
- Wow. Sorry.
- Ugh.

126
So, uh, how are the new people?

127
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

128
Including, um, "Evil Bitch"
and, uh, "Sick Bastard."

129
- Oh, gosh, a contraction. Ooh, ow!
- Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

130
- Are you looking at her?
- No!

131
- Don't look at her, you sick bastard!
- I swear I wasn't looking at her!

132
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

133
I'm just gonna...

134
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

135
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

136
You miss your girlfriend?

137
- Just ignore them.
- Ugh.

138
- You okay?
- Yeah.

139
- Ross.
- What?

140
- He's looking at me.
- Hey!

141
Wanna live to see your baby?

142
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

143
Oh, good God! If you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

144
Since when are you
so crazy about babies?

145
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.

146
What?

147
We talk about having
babies someday, not now...

148
...but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

149
We're really good.

150
We are pretty good.

151
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

152
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

153
I mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

154
It's not right!
We're not ready for a kid!

155
- What?
- I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

156
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?

157
We're trying to get pregnant.

158
Mm.

159
I'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

160
- So when do you want to start trying?
- All right, hold on a sec.

161
- Period math?
- Yeah.

162
Well, we could start trying now.

163
- Right here?
- No, not here.

164
Maybe here.

165
We got time to kill.
We're in a building that's full of beds!

166
And it's so clean!

167
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

168
- Aw, it ate your money?
- No.

169
- I'll see you downstairs then.
- All right.

170
All right.

171
Hey, I got one! I got one!

172
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
- Oh, up or down'?
- Oh. Down, please.

174
I hate to be a ball-buster,
but can I just do it?

175
- Could you press up too?
- Sure.

176
- I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
- How did yours happen?

177
It's a long, embarrassing story.

178
Let's just say, there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

179
- How about you?
- Car accident.

180
- Idiot on a cell not paying attention?
- Yeah. Me.

181
- Oh, hey, that's me.
- Okay.

182
Hey, uh, I take it you're
just visiting someone.

183
Uh-huh. Yeah.

184
Well, um, if you have some time,
and you wanna visit someone else...

185
Yeah. I would like that.

186
- Great. I'm in room...
- Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

187
You gotta press the button.

188
They're bringing in another woman.

189
Ugh. Is she pregnant yet?

190
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.

191
- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
- Oh, okay. Here, here.

192
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ow, ooh, ow!
- That's it.

193
- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
- Yeah, it was.

194
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

195
Mm, mm.

196
Oh, that was a big one.

197
Could you help me'? The patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.

198
He's in a wheelchair.
He's early to mid-30$, very attractive.

199
- I know who you're talking about.
- Yay! Great! What room is he in?

200
Sorry. That information is restricted.

201
- She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
- Dr. Drake who?

202
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.

203
- At this hospital?
- Damn it! We're losing precious time.

204
You want this man's blood
on your head...

205
- Hands.
- Hands.

206
It is essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

207
He's a patient of mine.

208
- He's in room 816.
- 816. Thank you.

209
- And what is his name?
- No.

210
- I think we found a place.
- Okay.

211
- Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
- Okay.

212
- We'll dim the lights.
- Okay.

213
Or turn them out altogether.

214
Uh, no scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

215
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

216
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

217
Oh, right! Ha, ha.

218
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

219
Ooh, this is it!

220
- That's him!
- Great. Go get him!

221
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

222
He's not really my type.

223
Not you. Dr. Ramoray.
Ask him questions and see what he's like.

224
- People tell doctors everything.
- You said he's great.

225
Guys I meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

226
- You do attract some stinkers.
- I know.

227
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.

228
Three women have had their babies.

229
Give me good news. How many
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

230
- Three.
- Just 3?

231
I'm dilated 3!

232
We are moving along slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

233
- I'll be back soon.
- Thank you.

234
I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.

235
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

236
- Actually, it's more like this.
- Oh, stupid metric system.

237
Oh! Oh! Oh!

238
We'll take you straight
to the delivery room.

239
Oh, for the love of God!

240
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few
routine questions I need to ask you.

241
I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

242
I know. I'm a neurologist.
To be safe...

243
...Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

244
Dr. Wells is a woman.

245
That was a test. Good response.

246
- All right. Uh, full name?
- Clifford Burnett.

247
- Date of birth?
- November 16, 1968.

248
Age?

249
- Can't you figure that out?
- I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

250
- I'm 33.
- Okay.

251
- And, uh, are you married?
- No.

252
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

253
Are all the questions this personal?

254
Yes.

255
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

256
- Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

257
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

258
- No.
- Excellent. Excellent.

259
And, uh, finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

260
- No!
- Ooh. Wrong answer.

261
- What else? What else?
- Uh, he's 33.

262
Uh-huh.

263
- A widower.
- Oh.

264
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.

265
Enter Pheebs.

266
- This room's available.
- Okay! Wait, listen to me!

267
Since I've been waiting,
four women...

268
...one higher than the centimeters
I'm dilated...

269
...have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. My turn. It's only fair.

270
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.

271
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

272
- Uh, Rach?
- You get back on that case, honey!

273
I don't think the next
patient is far along.

274
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

275
Oh, my God!

276
I can't believe this!

277
And yet, somehow, it's true.

278
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

279
Squeeze your legs together,
cover the baby's ears.

280
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi, sweetheart.

281
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think
you've met. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.

282
I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.
Thank God for adult acne!

283
I can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

284
Really?

285
What did he say?

286
You have to speak loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

287
- Oh, there you go.
- Of course he is.

288
Congratulations.
I didn't even know you got married.

289
- Oh, no. We didn't.
- No, no, we...

290
What?

291
We're just having this baby together,
but, uh, that's all. You know?

292
Why?

293
Uh, we're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

294
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

295
Just tell me how.

296
Uh-oh. Oh, I feel another one coming.

297
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!

﻿1
Previously on Friends:

2
Seventeen hours, I have been at this.

3
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

4
Just three? I'm dilated three.

5
- We've talk about having babies someday.
- So we're gonna try?

6
- Right here?
- No, not here.

7
Maybe here.

8
This is your grandmother's
engagement ring.

9
I want you to give it to Rachel.

10
- Mom, no.
- Ross, this isn't just some girl...

11
...you picked up in a bar and humped.

12
- Hey, I take it you're visiting someone?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

13
- Wanna visit someone else?
- Yeah, I would like that.

14
- That's him.
- Great. Well, go get him.

15
Or maybe you could go in first.

16
Hi, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

17
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

18
Oh, my God.

19
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty,
private room right next door to hers?

20
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

21
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants.

22
Okay, mister. Fertilize me.

23
Does that sound like Janice?

24
If it's not, then there's two of them.

25
And that would mean
it's the end of the world.

26
H93'-

27
- Hey.
- Hi.

28
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you doing?

29
Oh, not bad. You know that feeling...

30
...when you're trying to blow
a Saint Bernard out your ass?

31
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

32
Mother of God, it's true.

33
Chandler Bing.

34
Janice.

35
Notjust Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

36
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

37
You remember, Chandler.

38
Janice, I didn't know you were pregnant.

39
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

40
It's you.

41
This is yours.

42
What?

43
Ha, look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

44
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

45
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you rather eat?

46
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

47
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

48
Because at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

49
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

50
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

51
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just my foot itches like crazy.

52
On. I'll get it.

53
Wow. I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

54
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

55
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

57
...and I have had no babies.

58
Why doesn't she want to come out?

59
You know what I think it is?

60
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

61
...over the last nine months
that she just doesn't want to leave.

62
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me.

63
- Oh, God. Ooh, ooh...
- Okay. Okay.

64
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

65
Doctor, you gotta do something.
You gotta give me drugs...

66
...or you gotta light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out.

67
Actually, I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

68
- What?
- Ten centimeters.

69
You're about to become a mom.

70
Oh, my God. Okay.

71
Ha-ha-ha, beat you, sucker. Oh, baby.

72
Oh, my God. That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

73
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

74
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

75
...in my room,
asking me all these weird questions.

76
Cliff, do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?

77
Rachel's having her baby.

78
That's him. You know him?

79
Okay. Okay. I... Okay. Um... This...

80
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

81
Um, if it, you know...
If it helps, you came off great.

82
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

83
I don't believe this. You got him
to pretend he was some fake doctor?

84
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

85
And then you tried
to make me think that I was crazy?

86
You're right, that was wrong.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

87
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

88
I don't think so.

89
Uh, if I may?

90
Look, Cliff, you told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

91
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

92
Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.

93
Uh, she gave birth
to her brother's triplets.

94
Oh, oh, oh.
Her twin sister used to do porn.

95
- Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

96
Um...

97
Look, we don't really know each other,
so it'd be really easy to just forget this...

98
...but there seems to be something
between us. And I don't know about you...

99
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

100
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither.

101
- Push.Push.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh...

102
We're gonna push for five more seconds.

103
Five, four...

104
Three, two, one. Oh!

105
Okay, the next contraction
should be in about 20 seconds.

106
- I can't. I can't push anymore.
- Sweetie, you're doing great.

107
Oh, God. Twenty seconds, my ass!

108
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

109
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

110
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God.

111
Don't say "Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God," what?

112
What is that?

113
That's the baby's buttocks. She's breech.

114
- Oh, my God. I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God.

115
Is she gonna be okay?

116
- She's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

117
She's in a more difficult position,
so you're gonna have to push harder.

118
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go. Go.

119
Rachel,
you're gonna have to push harder.

120
- I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

121
- Let's go.
- I can't do it.

122
- No, please, you do it for me.
No...

123
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

124
Good.

125
Keep pushing.

126
Are you okay?

127
You have no idea how much this hurts.

128
Keep going! Keep going!

129
Here we go.

130
Oh, oh! She's upside down,
but she's coming. She's coming.

131
- Oh, God!
- Oh. Oh, my God.

132
Oh, my God, she's here.

133
Oh, she's perfect.

134
Oh, wow. Oh, she's so tiny.

135
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

136
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

137
Here she is.

138
Oh, you.

139
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

140
I know. Oh.

141
Yes. Oh.

142
Oh, she's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

143
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

144
That's fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Green.

145
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Green.

146
Hello, Baby Girl.

147
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

148
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

149
Here.

150
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

151
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

152
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

153
...and then 47 hours later, here she is.

154
She looks so real.

155
You know what I mean.

156
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

157
Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute.

158
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

159
I won't.

160
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Sorry, I just can't stop crying.

161
The doctor said it's completely normal,
with the hormones...

162
- ...plus you're sleep-deprived.
- So? You guys are all sleep-deprived.

163
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

164
Oh, God.

165
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

166
Oh.

167
So do you know
what you're gonna call her yet?

168
Oh. Wait a minute,
it's not gonna be Baby Girl?

169
I thought that was so original.

170
Uh, actually,
we've narrowed it down to two names.

171
Yeah, and you know what?
I love them both.

172
So why don't you just pick one,
and that'll be it.

173
Wow, um, okay. Uh, everyone?

174
This is Isabella.

175
- Hi, Isabella.
- Hi.

176
- What?
- That's not her name.

177
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

178
- What was the other one, Ross?
- Um, Delilah.

179
Oh, great. Suddenly she
sounds like a biblical whore.

180
- Ahem, so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
- Yay.

181
What are we gonna do?

182
- It's okay, honey. You'll find a name.
- Ugh. Easy for you to say.

183
You already know
what your kids' names are gonna be.

184
- You do?
- Yeah. I had them picked out since I was 14.

185
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

186
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Um, okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

187
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

188
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

189
Okay. It's Emma.

190
Emma.

191
See, I don't want it.

192
- Take it.
- What?

193
She's clearly an Emma.

194
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

195
Yeah. But I love you more.

196
Oh.

197
Besides, you know, nothing goes
with Bing. So I'm screwed.

198
Yoo-hoo.

199
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

200
Oh.

201
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

202
He's a keeper. Ha, ha.

203
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, you know, I'm fine.

204
Can I just say,
I really admire what you're doing.

205
Just raising her all alone.

206
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

207
Oh, sure. Now.

208
But what happens when he meets
somebody else and gets married?

209
Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.

210
I'm telling you, Rachel. Listen to Janice.

211
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

212
That's never gonna happen with Ross.

213
That's what I thought
about my first husband.

214
Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
the weekend with her father...

215
...and little Miss New-Boobs.

216
Really?

217
I hate to be the one to say it...

218
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

219
Well, that's, you know, that's...

220
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

221
You know what?
Maybe we won't be alone.

222
Because lately things
have been happening...

223
...between me and Ross, you know?

224
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

225
So it might be the beginning
of something.

226
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

227
Oh. Who's this little guy?

228
- Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no. Ha, ha.

229
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

230
- Man, you see the kid on that nose?
- Uh-huh.

231
- You know what I was thinking about?
- Huh?

232
Um, that kiss before we left
the apartment.

233
That was something, huh?

234
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

235
But we, we gotta be careful. Heh.

236
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

237
Right.

238
We don't want to go down that road,
do we?

239
No. No, of course not.
No, that's why I brought it up.

240
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

241
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

242
And so it begins.

243
She in there?

244
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

245
Oh.

246
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks more like.

247
You or Rachel?

248
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous. It's all Rachel.

249
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

250
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

251
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

252
It's complicated, okay?

253
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, you love her, you always have...

254
...you have a child together.
There's no right answer.

255
Look, we've been together.
Okay, and then apart.

256
And then together, and then apart.

257
And now we have a baby.

258
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

259
I could never do that to Emma.

260
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

261
What, do they put something
in the water in this place?

262
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

263
I know, I know, I know.

264
If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

265
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

266
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

267
H93'-

268
I just saw a woman breastfeeding
both of her twins at the same time.

269
It is like a freak show up here.

270
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

271
What is it? Hey?

272
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

273
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

274
What are you talking about: "alone"?
What about Ross?

275
Oh, please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New-Boobs.

276
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

277
I'm just saying that, you know...

278
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

279
...and he's gonna have his own life.

280
Right?

281
Yeah, I guess so.

282
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

283
Pretty dumb, huh?

284
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

285
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

286
Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.

287
Oh, Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

288
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

289
Oh, honey, could you grab me
my other box of tissues?

290
They're right on that chair
under Ross' coat.

291
Sure.

292
Oh, my God.

293
Joey?

294
Oh, my God.

295
Okay.

296
- That was amazing.
- I know.

297
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

298
We may have started our family.

299
Nine months from now,
we could be here...

300
...having our own baby.

301
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.

﻿1
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

2
Bermuda, Bahama
Come on, pretty mama

3
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

5
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

6
I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo.

8
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

9
Good, you're still here. I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
Oh, thank you.

11
And I wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

12
What? What? What?

13
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

14
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm so relieved that you guys know.

16
- That's so great. I'll be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

17
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

18
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

19
Okay, great. Now that you all know,
you can give me advice on how to tell Ross.

20
What were you gonna say?

21
That I'm gonna have the baby,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

22
Well, that sounds good.

23
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

24
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

25
Yeah, bye.

26
What was that all about?

27
Well, I guess no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

28
What? I didn't
even know! Why didn't you tell me?

29
Why am I talking like this?

30
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

31
What? I'm an excellent
secret-keeper. I've kept all our secrets.

32
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

33
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

34
- Psst. You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

35
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

36
You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

37
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love. All in good time.

38
Oh, shoot. I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in later, right?

39
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

40
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take away our keys?

41
Maybe they don't trust us.

42
They let me keep my key
the last time they were out of town.

43
You mean the time
you broke the ketchup bottle...

44
...and cleaned it up
with Monica's guest towels?

45
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

46
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

47
- What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

48
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of this.

49
Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

50
I need to get into Monica
and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.

51
Uh... Uh... Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

52
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

54
- She was looking for you.
- Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

55
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

56
- Oh, no.
- What?

57
I think I might know
what this is about.

58
Really?

59
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

60
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

61
And?

62
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?

63
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

64
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

65
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

66
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

67
I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

68
No wonder she was looking
at me all funny during the wedding.

69
She didn't say anything to you?

70
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- It could've been...

71
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

72
Man, you know what I have to realize?

73
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

74
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

75
I should remember that.

76
Next.

77
- They're kissing. Let's go around them.
- Leave them alone. They're in love.

78
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

79
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

80
Because she said, "Next."

81
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

82
Aw. Let me see what I can do.
There are some first-class seats available.

83
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon.

84
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

85
We are on our honeymoon.

86
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

87
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you because
I'm so in love with my new husband.

88
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

89
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

90
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing, bump us up to first class?

91
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.

92
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets. Damn it.

93
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

94
I still can't believe they took away my key.
You trust me with yours.

95
Of course I do.
And I'll give it back to you...

96
...as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

97
What the hell is that?

98
- Whoa, whoa. Treeger, what are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak in here.

99
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before the place explodes.

100
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will start asking questions.

101
Come on, hurry up.

102
Oh!

103
We could have done that.

104
Look at that. They're going into
the first-class lounge.

105
- Do you know what they have in there?
- No.

106
Me neither. We have to get in!

107
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

108
Shh!

109
- Nice to see you again.
- Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

110
Yes, of course.

111
Would you move your thumb.
I can't see the seat number.

112
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

113
- Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted. Excuse us.

114
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

115
Fine.

116
Go, go, go!

117
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
Hi.

119
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

120
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside.

121
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

123
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I think I should talk first.

124
- Okay.
- Okay.

125
Here.

126
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross. Heh.

127
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

128
What?

129
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

130
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

131
Seriously, what?

132
Okay, okay. You know what?

133
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

134
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

135
- You know what? Ahem. Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

136
I'm pregnant.

137
Ross?

138
Okay, whenever you're ready.

139
And you're the father, by the way.
But you're good.

140
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

141
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay?
You can be as involved as you want.

142
Yeah, I, uh... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

143
...how this happened.

144
- We used a condom.
- I know.

145
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

146
What? What?

147
What?

148
Well, they should put that on the box!

149
- They do.
- No, they don't!

150
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

151
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

152
- Listen, I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? No, I'm not freaked out.

153
I'm indignant as a consumer!

154
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No. No, I wanna talk now.

155
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

156
- Okay, maybe I should come back...
- Shh!

157
Yeah, I'll press one!

158
- I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

159
Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.

160
Great. And could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

161
Because, you know,
they don't have any kids of their own...

162
...and this door was
like a child to them.

163
I have to put on a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

164
Oh, no.

165
This looks like an all-day job.
I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

166
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

167
Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga?

168
Sure.

169
- My God. What happened to the door?
- So it's noticeable, huh?

170
- Is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
- Didn't you two already talk?

171
Yeah, but...

172
Okay, look. You guys know Rachel and I slept
together, but there's something else.

173
Rachel's pregnant.

174
- Holy mother of God!
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

175
- With my child.
- That is brand-new information!

176
- You already know, don't you?
- A little bit.

177
- How you doing?
- Okay. Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

178
It's just I don't think
I handled it very well.

179
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

180
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

181
Then when I turned around,
she was gone.

182
Oh, Ross.

183
But in my defense, I found out
that condoms are only 97 percent effective.

184
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

185
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3 percent of the time they don't even work?

186
Huh? They should put that on the box!

187
- Evidently, they do.
- What?

188
- I can't believe we're here.
- You've gotta be kidding.

189
What?

190
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the Honeymoon Suite.

191
No! You have been screwing us all day!

192
- Who are you?
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

193
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

194
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

195
You can have the suite, if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

196
We're here to celebrate our love for
each other. We don't have to get free stuff.

197
We just want to be together.

198
We need the stuff.

199
Hey, Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I
smell gas coming from your apartment.

200
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
- What else is new?

201
- We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
- Do something. Get in there!

202
- How? I guess I could break down your door.
- Yeah, do that.

203
- You won't blame us for any damage?
- No.

204
- Are you doing it? I can't hear anything.
- Okay, I'll break it down.

205
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

206
Okay, we're in.

207
- Rachel, are you comfortable?
- If I said I was, would you judge me?

208
The doctor will be here soon
to do your sonogram.

209
Okay.

210
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn...

211
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
We need to talk.

213
Right now? I kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

214
Please. Please, I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

215
- That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
- Yeah, sorry.

216
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you.

217
- Head, Ross. Head, Ross. Head, Ross.
- Right.

218
I want you to know that I'll be
there through this whole thing. Okay?

219
The doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

220
- We can do that after we get married.
- Married?

221
Yeah, we should get married.

222
Because that's your answer
to everything?

223
No, because that's the right thing to do.

224
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But, Ross, we are not in love, are we?

225
No, but still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

226
Excuse me?

227
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

228
- What?
- I'm saying if you can't eat by yourself...

229
...how can you have a baby by yourself?

230
- I can too eat by myself.
- When have you ever?

231
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

232
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup.

233
Please, you inhale your food.

234
I grew up with Monica. If you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

235
Am I interrupting?

236
No, Dr. Long, please come in.
This is Ross, he's the father.

237
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

238
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.

239
- Why can't you admit you need me?
- I need you. I need you to stay near my head!

240
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

241
There's your uterus...

242
...and right here is your baby.

243
Oh, my God.

244
Wow.

245
There it is, I see it.

246
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

247
Thank you.

248
Pretty amazing, huh?

249
I don't see it!

250
- What? What?
- I can't see it.

251
- You just said that you did.
- I know, I lied.

252
I didn't want her to think I was a terrible
mother. I can't even see my own baby.

253
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

254
Oh.

255
Oh, it's beautiful.

256
I see it now.

257
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

258
Okay, come on. Come on.
All right. Okay. Okay.

259
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

260
Yeah.

261
Sweetie, that's it.

262
That's it? Well, I saw that.

263
Oh.

264
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

265
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

266
Yeah, that's our baby.

267
- Hi.
- Hey.

268
- So how was the doctor?
- Everything went great.

269
- Good.
- Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

270
Aw.

271
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

272
I know, I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right, um...

273
Ross, I lost it again.

﻿1
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

2
And I had a great time
on our honeymoon.

3
I can't wait to go in there and spend
the rest of our life together.

4
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
- Hey, you're back! Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

6
- Come on in!
- Yeah, come on!

7
How was the honeymoon?

8
So much fun. The best part is, we met
this incredible couple on the flight back.

9
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
They're cool.
They were on their honeymoon too.

11
They're terrific. They live here in the city.

12
Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
I wanna call.

13
Sorry, we're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

15
This is different.
Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.

16
Ugh, Greg and Jenny. Ugh!
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica."

17
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

18
- Listen, they're great. If you got a chance...
- You know what?

19
Why don't you give us our souvenirs
and get the hell out of here.

20
- We didn't get a chance to...
- You've got to be kidding me!

21
- We didn't get anything for anyone.
- Mm-hm, yeah. Nice necklace.

22
That you can have.

23
- Hi.
- Hey!

24
- Hello!
- Welcome home.

25
So, how was the honeymoon?

26
Great! How about you?
I mean, you're having a baby!

27
- Oh, look, I have a sonogram picture.
- Oh, good.

28
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

29
So now that Ross knows,
can you tell us how it happened?

30
When did it happen?
How many times did it happen?

31
- Monica, that's not right.
- What?

32
Start with where.

33
Well, it happened about six weeks ago.

34
And, uh, I had just got home from work
and Ross was already there.

35
- I guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
- You're welcome, buddy.

36
Yeah, thanks.

37
And so I had a lot of work, and Ross,
nice guy that he is, offered to help me out.

38
And then we had wine,
we got to talking.

39
Next thing you know,
out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.

40
Um, heh. That's...

41
That's a little misleading.

42
- What is?
- The lie you just told.

43
- That you came on to me?
- There's the one!

44
- But you did. Let's be honest.
- Yes, let's.

45
You know what? Uh, it's not important.

46
Heh, what's important is
that we're having a baby.

47
It doesn't matter who came on to who.

48
"Whom."

49
That's right.

50
- You kissed me first.
- What? You were begging me to kiss you!

51
You were sending me signals
all over the place.

52
- I was sending signals? Please.
- Yeah.

53
Okay, anyone think that
I'd actually send Ross begging signals?

54
Please, show of hands.

55
It doesn't matter what people "believe."
What matters is what happened.

56
These signals, explain this.
Maybe I need to be more careful.

57
Am I you sending these signals
right now?

58
- You know what? Just drop it.
- Show me how I begged you.

59
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

60
It's an expression.

61
I can't believe he taped
the two of them having sex.

62
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

63
Such a rookie mistake.

64
- Know who has a great camera?
- Greg and Jenny?

65
- Do you want to call them? I want to.
- Let's call.

66
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

67
Hello? 8th Street Deli?

68
Hey, hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

69
- Sorry, wrong number.
- Here you go, babe.

70
Hello? It's the deli again!

71
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

72
I don't think this number's right.

73
- What?
- You got fake-numbered.

74
- What? People don't do that.
- Oh, I think we do.

75
- A fake number? Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

76
You were a delight to talk to.

77
You asked those insightful,
great questions.

78
And you've never been funnier.

79
I mean, joke, joke, joke!
You were a hoot!

80
Don't worry about it.
You still got me and Phoebe.

81
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

82
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

83
Hmm, I wonder why, pervert.

84
Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.

85
That's, like, the pervert motto.

86
Yeah, they have you
raise your right hand...

87
...put your left hand down your pants
and repeat that.

88
Filming Rachel was not
something I planned.

89
Look, here's what happened.
And Joey can back me up on this.

90
About a month and a half ago,
remember I came to you with a problem?

91
Um, a...

92
The personal thing?

93
- Pers...? What personal thing?
- About... About sex?

94
That I hadn't had sex in months?

95
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

96
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
Do you have a minute?

98
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

99
Sure, yeah.

100
How about, uh,
you showering with your mom?

101
I actually had a topic in mind.

102
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

103
- Oh, for, like, months?
- Five, to be...

104
...lying. Six.

105
Six months? That's rough.

106
Well, it's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the, uh, small things in life.

107
Like the sound of a bird,
or the color of the sky.

108
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

109
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

110
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

111
Okay, okay. Oh! I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

112
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it, they're like putty.

113
Really? Tell it to me.

114
Okay. Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

115
But you have to remember,
it is just the story.

116
- I'll try to control myself.
- Okay. Ahem.

117
Years ago, when I was backpacking
across Western Europe...

118
Heh, you were backpacking
across Europe?

119
- Have a nice six more months, Ross.
- Okay, okay!

120
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and?

121
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

122
I was at the end of this path.
I came to a clearing, and there was a lake.

123
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

124
It was dead silent. Gorgeous.

125
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

126
But she was crying.

127
Why?

128
Mm! Mm, this is great wine.

129
It's from France.

130
In Europe.

131
Western Europe.

132
You know, um, a few years ago
I was backpacking across Western Europe.

133
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Wait, it gets better.

134
Um, yeah, I was in, um, Barcelona.

135
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

136
- Anyway, um, so I was hiking...
- I love hiking!

137
Oh, that's great!

138
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo...

139
- I think it's "Tibidabo."
- Okay, do you want to tell the story?

140
Whoa, what are you doing here?
How'd your date go?

141
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

142
- Your story sucks.
- If it didn't work, you didn't tell it right.

143
- Show me how you did it.
- No, I don't want to.

144
- How long since you seen a girl naked?
- I was backpacking across Western Europe.

145
- I'm not feeling it.
- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

146
- No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
- It's been six months. I'm always hot.

147
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

148
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

149
Do what I do
when I'm preparing for an audition.

150
I'll set you up with my video camera.

151
You can record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

152
I'll try that.

153
All right. Now, you're all set up.
Good to go.

154
- Just hit record. Good luck.
- Thanks.

155
And Joe, listen. If you ever have
any problem with the ladies...

156
...you know I'll help you out.

157
That means a lot to me, man.

158
Hello.

159
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

160
- Rachel.
- Oh, Ross.

161
- Hi.
- Thank God you're here.

162
You have to help me.
Were you just talking to yourself?

163
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

164
When she came in, I got distracted
and totally forgot about the camera.

165
It kept rolling and recorded everything.

166
- Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
- Yeah.

167
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

168
This is not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

169
Thank you.

170
You'll show it to me.

171
- No.
- You're right.

172
- Joey, no.
- Loud and clear.

173
I don't get why Greg and Jenny
would give us a fake number.

174
You know, if they knew
what they were doing...

175
...they didn't give you real names either.
- Okay.

176
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but they don't give out fake names.

177
Oh, yeah?

178
Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.

179
Regina Phalange.

180
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- I know.

181
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

182
I thought you said those jokes
were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

183
Joke, joke...

184
- Maybe it was your questions.
- What about my questions?

185
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

186
- Ooh, sorry, was that another joke?
- Was that another question?

187
- Hey, is Ross still here?
- Uh, no, Rach, he's gone, but listen.

188
He told us what happened.
It sounds like an honest mistake.

189
Really? How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

190
Oh, forget it.

191
Oh, there he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

192
Look, it was an accident, okay?

193
I feel bad it happened.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

194
Anyway, here.

195
I thought you might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

196
Thank you.

197
What?

198
- You don't want to see this, do you?
- Hell, yeah!

199
I am not gonna show you this.

200
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

201
Forget it. She's destroying it.

202
Okay, fine! Fine. We'll just have to think
of some other way...

203
...to put the "who came on to who"
thing to rest.

204
Come on now, think!

205
Forget it. It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants with it.

206
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

207
- I want to see it.
- What?

208
Clearly you don't want people
to see this tape.

209
I don't want people
to see this tape either.

210
But you so badly don't want people to see
it that it makes me want to see it. See?

211
Are we watching the tape or not?

212
- I don't want people to see it for your sake.
- Oh, I don't believe you.

213
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

214
- Rachel, please?
- Oh, a little preview.

215
Fine. But I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

216
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying:

217
Okay, here we go.

218
Hello. Can I can get you anything?

219
I'm so happy.

220
Oh, thank God you're here.

221
I need you to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

222
- Oh, there I am.
- You're gonna get pregnant.

223
I screwed up so bad.

224
I told Monica that I'd stuff and send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

225
You didn't do it?

226
I had put them in...
In my desk at work...

227
...and I forgot about them until today.

228
Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

229
- Kind of hurting my hand though.
- I know.

230
I can not believe that I did this.

231
Especially after Monica
just went on and on and on about it.

232
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

233
Please drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

234
Whoa, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

235
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

236
Did you do it on our invitations?

237
Not on the ones we sent out.

238
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

239
Can you believe this is happening?

240
- It seems like yesterday they got engaged.
- I know.

241
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost...

242
Oh, I remember how we almost.

243
You think we would've gone through with it
if we hadn't gotten caught?

244
You think we would have done it?

245
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.

246
Oh, I wanted to.

247
So we... We both wanted to.

248
- Interesting.
- Mm.

249
Anyway, um,
probably worked out for the best.

250
Yeah, sure.

251
In about 10 seconds,
you're gonna see him kiss me.

252
And in about 5 seconds,
you're gonna see why.

253
Ross, did I ever tell you about the time...

254
...that I went backpacking
through Western Europe?

255
Okay, get ready to see some begging.

256
Oh, you came on to Ross!

257
- What?
- Now I'm so happy.

258
- What are you talking about?
- You used the Europe story!

259
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

260
- How do you know about that story?
- How do you know about that story?

261
I heard it from my friend Irene
who heard it from some guy.

262
Some guy!

263
No, no, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

264
Ken Adams!

265
Hi.

266
So apparently, uh, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

267
Yeah, listen, about that...

268
...the whole "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

269
I think it would have happened
either way.

270
I mean, if you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

271
- It was an amazing night.
- It was. It was an amazing night.

272
You think it looked amazing?

273
I, uh... I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

274
Yeah, me neither.

275
Yet.

276
Uh...

277
- That... That may be weird.
- Yeah, it would be really weird.

278
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

279
- Mind if I mute?
- Oh, please.

280
- Oh, there go the clothes.
- You are undressing awfully quickly.

281
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

282
- Huh.
- Huh.

283
- Huh.
- Hey. Heh.

284
- We look pretty good.
- I was gonna say.

285
- Ooh, nice tan.
- Thank you.

286
- I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
- Ah.

287
Ugh.

288
- Have you been working out?
- I have been working out.

289
Well, this is so much better than I ever...

290
- Oh.
- Oh.

291
- Ew.
- Ew.

292
- Oh, that's not pretty.
- Oh.

293
- Oh. Oh, God.
- Oh.

294
- Oh, no. Oh, no! No!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

295
Hello, Greg?
Hi, this is Monica from the plane.

296
Listen, the number that
you gave me, uh, 8-5-3...

297
Their old number! Jenny's been
giving it out since they moved!

298
- Jenny! That is so Jenny!
- I know.

299
Listen, um, how would you like to
get together next Saturday?

300
Okay, how about Sunday?

301
Okay, um, the week after that?

302
The week after that?

303
You know what, Greg? Heh.

304
We are good, interesting,
funny people with good questions.

305
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that, then...

306
January 15?

307
We'll see you then! Okay!

﻿1
Okay, this one's rare.
This one is medium well. Go!

2
- Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?
- Hey!

3
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

4
All right, okay.

5
- Oh. Well, hello there.
- Hi.

6
I didn't see this on the menu.

7
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

8
- Oh. So you're Monica's boss?
- Actually, she's my boss.

9
- "Sous" is French for "under."
- Ah! I "sous-stand." Heh.

10
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

11
- Yeah.
- You made pesto?

12
Yes, I did.

13
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o? Heh.

14
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

15
I still need the calamari and the salad.

16
- I like your necklace.
- Oh, I made it myself.

17
- You are so talented.
- Well, it's no pesto.

18
All right, let's just cut to the chase.
Okay? You're single, you're single.

19
He gets off work at 11.
She'll be waiting for your call.

20
I'll give him your number if I could
just get calamari and caesar salad!

21
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

22
- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
- You know me, sir.

23
Oh, I have a question. Do you know how
can I get around the computer network...

24
...so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

25
You're a joker, Bing.

26
What's funny about that?

27
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

28
Oh, uh, I think you know
where I wanna go.

29
- The Hard Rock Cafe?
- Yeah.

30
- Again?
- Yeah.

31
- I'm telling you, I like the food.
- You like the Purple Rain display.

32
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

33
- Did that guy just call you Toby?
- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

34
- Why don't you correct him?
- Oh, it's been way too long now.

35
The first time, we were passing each other
so I didn't say anything.

36
The next time he said,
"Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"

37
And I wanted the doughnut.

38
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

39
- Five years? Chandler, you have to tell him.
- No, that would be so awkward.

40
Besides, we work in different departments.
He's on the sixth floor.

41
So he calls me Toby once in a while.
Big deal. Could be worse.

42
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

43
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

44
Oh, my God.

45
Chandler M. Bing.

46
It's not just an M.
Your middle name is Muriel!

47
Shh! It is a family name.

48
Chandler Muriel Bing.

49
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

50
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your headaches and memory loss.

51
What is it?

52
Apparently, your brain transplant
was not entirely successful.

53
It seems your body
is rejecting Jessica's brain.

54
Is it serious?

55
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body...

56
...synthesize antibodies,
introduce them into your system...

57
...which could stop you
from rejecting the brain.

58
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

59
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body...

60
...it was gone.

61
Cut. Very nice, people.

62
- Let me change and we can go to dinner.
- Wh...? Oh.

63
- What happened to Jessica's body?
- I'm not telling. You'll have to see it on TV.

64
- You don't know, do you?
- No. Couldn't care less.

65
- Hey, good scene, man. All right.
- You too.

66
- What? You weren't in it.
- Oh...

67
Oh, sorry. Uh, Kash,
this is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash.

68
- Hi.
- How come I haven't seen you here before?

69
Well, heh. Joey probably
just thinks I'll embarrass him.

70
He thinks I'm some kind
of soap opera nut. Ha-ha-ha.

71
Which I'm not. I'm not. Ha, ha.

72
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

73
And, uh... And your dog's name is Wally.

74
- Look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
- Here we go.

75
We're leaving. Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

76
- Oh, Monica.
- Hi.

77
Oh, my God, I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

78
Ugh! I can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.

79
- Uh, I... I have to fire him.
- Why?

80
Because He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

81
Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.

82
He was nervous.
You can be very intimidating.

83
And I've met your pastry chef.
She can stand to be taken down a peg.

84
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

85
But Monica, he loves his job so much.

86
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

87
All right. But if he lights someone
else on fire, he is out of there.

88
That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.

89
Oops, looks like when he got the pastry
chef, he got you a little bit too.

90
I paid to have this done.

91
Love it!

92
- Hey.
- Hi.

93
Oh, you know, uh,
Kash really liked you the other day.

94
- He said he thought you were charming.
- Ha!

95
- I thought I was an idiot.
- I'm with you.

96
- He asked if you'd go out with him.
- Oh!

97
Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

98
- What did you say?
- I said, "No." Heh.

99
What?

100
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

101
Okay, Joey.

102
First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.

103
Second, what did he say
when you told him I was pregnant?

104
I didn't. I didn't know
if you were telling people.

105
This was back when I thought Kash
was still "people."

106
- Good. Don't. Just have him call me.
- I really don't think that's such...

107
Okay, you go do it.
I'll come back to that set.

108
- I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.
- Yup.

109
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?

110
- If I see him, I'll ask.
- Aah!

111
Hey, Bing. Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

112
- Yeah.
- You know each other?

113
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

114
What do you think
of adding him to our team?

115
Bob? Ooh.

116
Working here with us? Every day?

117
Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.

118
- Really? They love him down on six.
- But this is 11.

119
It's almost twice as hard up here.

120
Okay, I hear you loud and clear.

121
- Bob will stay put.
- I think it's best, sir.

122
We really do need to find somebody.
Work is starting to pile up.

123
I've got a stack of documents on my desk
this high.

124
What you should do,
toss them in the shredder...

125
...and claim you never got them.

126
That's a good one, Bing.

127
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

128
- Hey.
- Okay, I gave him another chance...

129
...but Tim has got to go.
- But...

130
No! No, no. He's totally incompetent.

131
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

132
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

133
- Okay, but you can't fire him today.
- Why not?

134
- Because I'm dumping him today.
- What? You said he was sweet.

135
He is sweet. He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

136
"Did you get home from work okay?
Did you get out of the shower okay?"

137
- Just don't pick up your phone.
- Then he comes over!

138
"I was worried about you."
Ugh, be a man!

139
So now I'm not allowed to fire him?

140
You can't fire him and dump him
in the same day. He'll kill himself.

141
I fire him today,
you go out with him another week.

142
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.

143
Then we'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.

144
Okay. But the question is,
who's gonna go first?

145
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

146
- What do you mean?
- The boss that fires a guy...

147
...that's just been dumped? Bitch!

148
And the woman who dumps a guy
that's just been fired?

149
Blond bitch!

150
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

151
Ugh. All right, that makes sense.

152
Agh, but...

153
...screw you! I'm going first!

154
- Hey, Toby, you got a sec?
- Sure, what's up?

155
I just had a meeting.
I was hoping to get transferred up here.

156
But I found out it's not gonna happen.

157
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11 th-floor material."

158
Say, uh, who the hell is this Chandler?

159
What do you think is the better excuse
for why I'm not drinking on this date?

160
Um, "I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"...

161
...or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

162
- Hey.
- Hi.

163
So, what do you want to do tonight?

164
There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelika
that's supposed to be very powerful.

165
- Interested?
- No. No.

166
But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

167
- Rach, you wanna come?
- Oh, no, I can't. I got a date.

168
- Heh. A date?
- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

169
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's, uh... It's regular. It's, uh...

170
It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.

171
It's no Ukrainian film, I'll tell you.

172
Ooh! Earrings!

173
- A date? She's got a date? With who?
- I set her up with this actor on my show.

174
- You set her up?
- No.

175
- Joey, what were you thinking?
- That it would probably be okay...

176
...because Ross hasn't gone out
with Rachel in five years.

177
Joey, I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about my baby.

178
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

179
- Where is this "actor" taking them?
- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

180
I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
to some Italian place on Staten Island.

181
A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?

182
Do you have any idea
how dangerous those are?

183
Aren't we talking about those big boats
that go, like, five miles an hour?

184
Why don't they just jump out
of an airplane? That's a fun date.

185
Or burn each other with matches?
That's fun too.

186
Whoo!

187
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Kash.

188
- Uh, hey, Ross, this is Kash.
- Hey.

189
- Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
- Yeah.

190
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

191
Hey, you guys, do you think
this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.

192
- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
- Yeah. See you guys later.

193
- Okay. Have a great time, you guys.
- Thank you.

194
And yes, it is too slutty!

195
- Hi.
- Ah!

196
Hi.

197
I'm so glad you called.
I feel like it's always me calling you.

198
So, what's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

199
It will be in a minute. Listen.

200
- Tim, you're a really great guy.
- That's because I'm with you.

201
Aw.

202
I'm just... I'm in a place in my life
right now where I...

203
Whoops! So sorry. "This just in." Heh.

204
It's 911 from the restaurant.
That means Monica needs me.

205
Oh, no, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

206
Aw...

207
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

208
And I will be holding you right here.

209
So, what movie do you wanna see?
And not another one I have to read.

210
I get enough of that from books.

211
- Books?
- All right, car magazines, cereal boxes...

212
...but it's, like, enough!

213
I tell you what, why don't we...?

214
Why don't we stay. Let's not see a movie.
We'll just hang.

215
Just wait for Rachel
to come back from her date?

216
Hey, if that's what you wanna do,
I'm not gonna say no.

217
Dude, what is going on?

218
- I just... I have to find out how it went.
- Why?

219
This guy could be my baby's stepfather.

220
They go on one date and you're worried
about them getting married?

221
He's not you.

222
I just, I can't believe she's dating.

223
- What did you think she was gonna do?
- I don't know.

224
I guess I can't believe
any of this is happening.

225
What do you mean?

226
I always thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

227
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...

228
...it breaks my heart a little.

229
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday.

230
My kid comes running in, leaps up on
the bed and we all read the paper together.

231
You know?
Maybe fight over the science section.

232
That's a nice picture.
Maybe you can still have that.

233
No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.

234
My baby went with her.

235
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

236
Hey, can I ask you something?

237
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

238
It used to be.

239
Now she doesn't really have a face.

240
Smoking body, though.

241
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

242
No. But, ugh, how much easier
would it be if it were?

243
I know, but I don't think
that's what she wants.

244
It's not what I want either.

245
And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her again.

246
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

247
Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought.
But no matter what...

248
...there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

249
Who cares what the picture looks like?

250
Yeah.

251
Hey, tell you what. Let's you and me
go out and have some fun.

252
Huh? Whatever you want. Come on.

253
- We can catch that Ukrainian film.
- No, I said fun.

254
- Hey, Toby?
- Hey, Bobby.

255
It's Bob, actually.

256
You work up here. Can you tell me
where Chandler Bing's office is?

257
Uh, yeah, it's right...

258
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

259
Ha, ha, I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

260
Okay, Bob, listen. Uh...

261
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

262
- Toby, don't.
- Bob.

263
Toby, I'm not gonna let you
cover for him.

264
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

265
Well that puts me in a difficult position.

266
- I got your page. Is everything okay?
- Uh, well, that depends.

267
- How are things with Phoebe?
- It's great. Thank you for introducing us.

268
Oh, my pleasure. Okay,
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

269
- Phoebe!
- Monica!

270
- I'm breaking up with you!
- You're fired!

271
- What?
- I'm breaking up with you.

272
- You're fired.
- Why?

273
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

274
And I'm sorry too. But, well,
I like things done a certain way.

275
- And the chemistry's just not right.
- Ooh, good. The chemistry thing for us too.

276
Wow, heh. Um, okay. Um...

277
I realize I came on a little strong.

278
But it's only because
I think you're so amazing.

279
And, uh...

280
I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity here...

281
...because you're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

282
Anyway, heh.

283
- Tim, wait. Wait. Um...
- Yeah?

284
I think I spoke too quickly.
There's a learning curve with this job.

285
- Maybe we could try it again.
- Really?

286
Thank you so much.

287
- Because I know I can be better.
- Okay.

288
And Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

289
- Hello. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

290
Uh, how was the date?

291
Well, I'm alone and I just bought $15
worth of candy bars. What do you think?

292
- Huh. What happened?
- Made the mistake...

293
...of telling him that I was pregnant.

294
- He didn't, uh, take it so well?
- Well, better than you.

295
- But still not what you want.
- Oh?

296
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said, uh:

297
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

298
- He sounds swell.
- Doesn't he?

299
Hey, you want a little cheering up?

300
- Yes. Okay.
- Sit down.

301
Guess whose middle name is Muriel?

302
- Chandler M. Bing.
- Yu-huh.

303
Oh, my God.

304
- I'm sorry about your date.
- It's all right.

305
I guess I'm just done
with the whole dating thing.

306
Just one more thing in my life
that is suddenly completely different.

307
- This is hard.
- Yeah, I know.

308
On the other hand, in, um...

309
In about seven months
you're gonna have something...

310
...that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

311
Just wait. Wait until, uh...

312
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

313
You have no idea.

314
Thanks, sweetie.

315
- You wanna grab some coffee?
- No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

316
- I thought I cheered you up.
- Oh, you did.

317
- There are 20 in here.
- Right.

318
- Good night.
- Good night.

319
- Ross?
- Yeah?

320
Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.

321
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

322
Wow, uh...

323
- How are you?
- I'm good, except, um...

324
...you still owe me a dance.

325
- Oh, that's right.
- Mm.

326
Well, uh, would you be interested
in seeing a Ukrainian film?

327
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

328
Great. Well, uh...

329
I think I might need
one more cup of coffee.

330
- Sure, uh, let me get it for you.
- Okay.

331
Bob? Bob!

332
Bob!

333
- What the hell are you doing?
- I just found out this is Chandler's office.

334
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!

﻿1
- Hey, guys, guess what.
- What?

2
I know it's last minute, but we've
decided to have a Halloween party.

3
- Oh, good!
- Great!

4
- And everybody has to wear costumes.
- Oh, I don't know...

5
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
Uh, I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
Pfft, heh.

9
Not two years in a row.

10
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
- You have to.

11
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

12
You're an actor.

13
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

14
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.
- The girl from their wedding?

15
- Yeah.
- Wow, hey.

16
If she needs any ideas for costumes,
she could be a, uh, bikini model...

17
...or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

18
Or, ooh, ooh. Leatherface
from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

19
No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.

20
Wasn't Joey hitting on her
at the wedding too?

21
That's right, he was hitting on her.

22
And I got her. I guess
the better man won. Heh.

23
Please don't take her from me.

24
- Ursula!
- Oh. Heh.

25
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

26
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

27
Wait a second!

28
Um, so, what's new with you?

29
Um, nothing. I mean,
I'm getting married next week.

30
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

31
It's gonna be a small ceremony.
Just family.

32
His.

33
Huh.

34
Okay.

35
I'm really happy for you.

36
Wait. If, um... If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

37
- Really?
- Sure, why not?

38
You could be my "sister" for the day.

39
Yeah, heh, okay.

40
Um, you know, my friends are having
a Halloween party tonight...

41
...at my old apartment,
so you could come.

42
Maybe I could meet the guy
you're marrying.

43
Well, I'm supposed
to be working tonight.

44
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

45
- By the way, it's a costume party.
- Oh, okay, so that's why you're...

46
No.

47
But thanks.

48
- Hi.
- You're supposed to wear a costume.

49
I am. I am a woman...

50
...who spent a lot of money on a dress
and she wants to wear it...

51
...because soon
she won't be able to fit into it.

52
- Oh. I'm Catwoman.
- Ah.

53
Who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

54
Okay.

55
- Trick or treat!
- Oh! Can I give out candy?

56
I really want to be with kids.

57
Ever since I got pregnant,
I have the strongest maternal instincts.

58
- Trick or treat!
- Just a minute!

59
We... Aah! Look at you guys!

60
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.

61
- And you are a very funny clown.
- Thank you.

62
And you...

63
...are so in style right now.

64
You know, I work at Ralph Lauren.

65
The whole fall line has got
this equestrian theme going on.

66
- Did you see the cover of Vogue...?
- Could I just have the candy?

67
Yeah. Sure.

68
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.

69
So we do, Supergirl.

70
It's me, Phoebe.

71
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

72
Listen, I appreciate
you getting the costume.

73
Oh, you did this to him?

74
What? I thought he'd love it.

75
His favorite book
was The Velveteen Rabbit.

76
The Velveteen Rabbit
was brown and white.

77
It was either a pink bunny,
or no bunny at all.

78
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

79
- Hey.
- You didn't dress up either?

80
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

81
Dude, what happened?

82
- How is that me?
- Okay, ahem.

83
I'm Chandler.

84
- Ha, ha! That is so you!
- Ha-ha-ha.

85
- When have I ever done that?
- When have I ever done that?

86
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

87
Oh, you're just the prettiest ballerina
ever I've ever seen.

88
Thank you.

89
Oh, wow. That deserves another candy.

90
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha-ha.

91
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

92
I love you!

93
Oh! Aw...

94
Oh, honey, here, take it all.

95
Monica? We need more candy.

96
- What? There's only been four kids.
- I know.

97
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

98
No wonder you're pregnant.

99
- Hey.
- Hey.

100
- What are you supposed to be?
- Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?

101
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

102
...and these are my antenna.

103
So Sputnik becomes?

104
Spud-nik! Spud-nik.

105
Wow, I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

106
Hey, all right! Ross came as doodie.

107
- No, I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.

108
- God!
- Hey, sweetie.

109
- Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
- Okay, I will.

110
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

111
- Ursula?
- Ursula's fiancé?

112
- Oh, my God. You're the sister.
- Yeah.

113
- I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
- Yeah.

114
I'm an idiot. Is your mother here?
I could give her a slap on the butt.

115
- My mother killed herself.
- See, and I knew that.

116
Now I'm sweating.

117
I'm really sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

118
No. We'll start over.

119
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Eric.

120
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- The sweat's in my eyes.

121
- It's burning.
- Okay.

122
- Thank you.
- There.

123
- So, what are you?
- I don't think they have a name for it.

124
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

125
- No, I meant your costume.
- Oh, um, I'm a solar system.

126
My student's helped me.
I teach second grade.

127
- I love the second grade.
- Really?

128
It's better than first grade,
where you don't know what's going on.

129
And definitely better than third grade.

130
You know, with all the politics
and the mind games.

131
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a masseuse, by day.

132
- You don't have to stand here with me.
- I'm having fun.

133
- I'm really excited for you and Ursula.
- I feel very lucky. She's great.

134
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.
- Thank you.

135
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

136
- You read comic books, right?
- Exclusively.

137
Who do you think would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

138
- Catwoman, hands down.
- Yeah.

139
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give the edge to Phoebe.

140
- What? Really?
- You kidding?

141
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She...

142
She's not right behind me, is she?

143
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

144
- Do you think I could take Rachel?
- I'm not sure.

145
What? Come on, I am tough!

146
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

147
Relax. What are you taking this
so seriously for? It doesn't matter.

148
Really? What would you say if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

149
I would say, "Woman, please."

150
Hey, Ursula's fiancé is really sweet.

151
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

152
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

153
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?
- What?

154
You're getting a crush
on your sister's fiancé.

155
No, I'm not, you are!

156
Here comes the temper.

157
- Trick or treat.
- Hi.

158
Hi. Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went to get some.

159
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

160
- Can I write you a check?
- Okay.

161
- Okay. What's your name?
- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

162
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

163
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.

164
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

165
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was hoping
you'd come by as a slutty nurse.

166
Um, actually, I'm just a nurse.

167
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but, you see, I'm maxed out.

168
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi! Wait.

169
- You're, um... You're a potato?
- Well, I'm a spud?

170
And the antenna...

171
- Oh, my God, you're Spud-nik!
- Yes!

172
Marry her.

173
Okay, here's a good one for you.

174
Who do you think would win a fight
between Ross and Chandler?

175
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

176
- So Ross?
- Yeah.

177
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

178
Oh, God.

179
Aw, look at you two.
So when did you guys meet?

180
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks, that's it?

181
I know. It sounds crazy, and it's not
like me to do something impulsive.

182
But she's so perfect,
and we have so much in common.

183
Oh, really?

184
- We're both teachers.
- Huh?

185
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps, really?

186
In fact, when we were
building houses in Uruguay...

187
...we were just two towns apart
and we never met.

188
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

189
- Shall we get me really drunk?
- Sure.

190
Ha, ha. Ugh.

191
Howdy, doodie.

192
That's funny, yeah.

193
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

194
Relax, man. Relax.
You're looking a little flushed.

195
Hey, I think we might find out
the answer to our question.

196
- What question?
- Who could kick whose ass in a fight...

197
...you or Ross?

198
- There's no question.
- So you think Ross too?

199
- You picked Ross?
- Ross is really strong.

200
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

201
- I can not believe you didn't pick me.
- In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.

202
I would destroy you.

203
Oh, really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

204
Oh, I'll prove it.
I'll prove it like a theorem!

205
All right! Okay, stop it. Stop it!

206
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

207
People came to see a fight,
let's give them what they came for!

208
- You guys could arm-wrestle.
- Yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.

209
- You're going down.
- Oh, yeah? You're going further down.

210
Downtown!

211
Seriously, guys,
the trash talk is embarrassing.

212
Oh, Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much for picking this up.

213
- You are so sweet.
- Really?

214
Someday, you are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

215
- Got to go.
- Trick or treat.

216
Hi! Wow! There you go.

217
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

218
Oh, yeah, we were,
but, um, now we've got candy.

219
I'd rather have the money.

220
Well, that's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

221
This isn't fair.

222
Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
and I gotta give you stuff?

223
Shut up!

224
You shut up!

225
- You can't tell me to shut up.
- Uh, I think I just did.

226
And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!

227
- Uh, Rach.
- No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

228
Wait, I had one more thing to say.

229
Oh, right. Shut up.

230
You're a mean old woman.

231
Oh, wait! No. Shut... Don't cry!

232
Let me get my checkbook!

233
Honey, you don't have to do this.

234
It's the strength you have inside
that means the most to me.

235
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

236
That's the strength I want
in the man I love.

237
That means nothing to me. Come on!

238
Ugh.

239
- Hi, liar.
- Hey.

240
You know, the only reason
he's marrying you...

241
...is because he thinks the things
you were saying were true.

242
- They could be true.
- But they're not.

243
Yeah. It's a fine line, huh?

244
- Why are you lying to him?
- I don't know.

245
He said he did this stuff, I said I did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

246
Honey?

247
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

248
She's helped so many people
quit smoking.

249
We'd better get going.

250
- You have a church group meeting.
- Right.

251
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

252
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

253
Pheebs, come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

254
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

255
Wait. What does the winner get?

256
- Pride.
- And dignity.

257
Heh. Okay, if you say so.

258
All right, ready, set, go!

259
Come on!

260
- Wow, they're both really strong.
- Or equally weak.

261
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

262
- So you getting tired?
- No. I could do this all day.

263
Yeah. Me too.

264
- Getting a little tired, though.
- God, I'm exhausted.

265
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

266
Oh, God, she's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

267
No way. Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

268
Hey, at least you have a wife.

269
I keep getting divorces
and knocking people up.

270
And I'm dressed as doodie.

271
- You're Spud-nik.
- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

272
- Please? She's watching.
- Ugh.

273
- Fine.
- Thanks.

274
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

275
Yay!

276
My hero!

277
You're a weird lady.

278
- Hey, Ursula said she left her purse.
- Oh.

279
What a relief. It has the numbers
of the people in her prayer chain.

280
I'm sure it does. Yeah. Yeah.

281
Well, guess I'll see you at the wedding.

282
Um, listen. I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the wedding.

283
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be okay.

284
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

285
- I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
- What?

286
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

287
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

288
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

289
Here's the name tag from the restaurant
where she works as a waitress.

290
Not a teacher, a waitress.

291
Here's her driver's license.
She always lies about this.

292
- How old did she say she was?
- She told me she was 25.

293
Aw. I almost don't want to show you this.

294
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

295
I am so stupid.

296
Of course she's lying.
She's not a teacher.

297
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

298
No, you're not stupid.

299
I'm not smart.

300
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

301
- To be romantic.
- That's good.

302
You should be impulsive
and you should be romantic.

303
Just, you did it with the wrong person.

304
- What?
- It's weird, two people look so alike.

305
And so different.

306
Eric! Let's go!

307
- Better go deal with it.
- Yeah, you should.

308
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

309
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
Well, I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

311
- That's not so bad.
- I also had to go to a couple houses...

312
...as his girlfriend.

313
Ugh, I am just awful with children.

314
Come on, you're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

315
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

316
- Really? That's all it is?
- Absolutely.

317
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

318
They get crazy during the summer too.

319
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

320
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that. Pfft.

321
Look, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry you lost.

322
Oh, listen. I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

323
- Heh, heh.
- Was that a secret, or a lie?

324
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

325
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

326
Oh, yeah, uh, Chandler let me win.

327
No, Chandler's really strong.
Oh, my arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

328
I am strong. I'll show you.

329
Chandler, please.

330
Oh, what's the matter? Are you scared?

331
Let's go, big bunny!

332
One, two, three. Go!

333
I'm gonna kill myself.

﻿1
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
You did the windows!

3
I have been begging for months
and you did, you cleaned!

4
- And nagging works!
- No, uh, I didn't actually do this.

5
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

6
No, it wasn't you.

7
- Well, then, who?
- I got a maid. Yay!

8
Oh, well, I hope by "maid,"
you mean "mistress"...

9
...because if some other woman
was cleaning...

10
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

11
"Relinquish" is just
a fancy word for "lose."

12
Look, she's really nice, okay?

13
And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges.

14
Did she really say that?

15
Yes, I distinctly remember
because I thought it was a joke.

16
- Now, just give her a chance, okay?
- Fine, I can do it.

17
Whoo.

18
- What's the matter?
- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

19
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying.

20
- Everywhere you go.
- I think it's coming from your bag.

21
I never get calls!

22
Hello?

23
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiancé.

24
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

25
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it.

26
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

27
I just... I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

28
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

29
- Wow, what did he do?
- Shh! I'm talking.

30
Anyway, I was wondering...

31
...if you were the sort of person
who eats lunch?

32
Are you asking me out?

33
Because it'd be weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

34
Yeah, um, okay.

35
I'm sorry. Bye.

36
No, wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

37
Fight for me!

38
Uh, I won't take no for an answer.

39
Not great, we can work on it at lunch.

40
Okay, um, I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

41
Great. Uh, how do you know where I live?

42
I've got friends too.

43
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

44
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

45
Oh, this day is gonna be much better
than I thought it was gonna be. Heh.

46
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

47
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

48
Can't, I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.

49
You're moving?

50
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

51
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

52
So does Joey know you're moving?

53
I haven't discussed it,
but he's gonna be relieved.

54
Last week he brought this girl over...

55
...and I started talking to her
about morning sickness.

56
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

57
- That's not really porn.
- Not so much.

58
You know what?
If you're looking for a place...

59
...I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

60
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

61
Well I don't know.
But how great would that be, huh?

62
You living in my building?

63
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want...

64
...with your permission.

65
- That really would be great.
- Yeah.

66
Well, can we see it?

67
Oh, maybe we shouldn't. If she
just died this morning. Out of respect.

68
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

69
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

70
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm Ross Geller.

71
I live in the building.

72
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

73
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

74
- She didn't pass away.
- What?

75
- My mother's still alive.
- Oh, thank God!

76
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning...

77
- ...but she's a tough old bird.
- Aww.

78
Are you close with her?

79
Of course. Heh.

80
Uh, yeah.
She and I would talk all the time...

81
...in the laundry room.

82
You speak Dutch?

83
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

84
So she's really not dead.

85
- No. She's hanging in there.
- Mm.

86
Do you think...? Could you tell me, is she
hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?

87
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

88
Oh, well, um, I make it myself.

89
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is...

90
You know what? We just met.

91
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna get the clothes
from the laundry room now...

92
...and when I come back,
I'll clean behind the fridge.

93
I love her.

94
I'll be back in a minute.

95
Okay.

96
- See? I told you.
- She stole my jeans!

97
What?

98
I have been looking for them all week
and she is wearing them.

99
So she stole your pants...

100
...and then she came back
and wore them in front of you?

101
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime.

102
She must have been
planning this for years.

103
I will prove it to you.

104
About a week ago,
I was wearing those jeans.

105
I dropped a pen in my lap
and it left an ink stain on the crotch.

106
When she comes back,
I will find it and show you that stain!

107
Is it possible the company
that sold the jeans...

108
...made more than just the one pair?

109
I guess.

110
So shouldn't we give her
the benefit of the doubt before we go...

111
...snooping around her crotch?

112
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

113
Heh. Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

114
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

115
- Hi.
- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

116
Yeah. Me too.

117
Not in the shaky,
angry way you are, though.

118
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.

119
- I had to get the engagement ring back.
- Ugh.

120
Just seeing her brought it all back.

121
All the lies, the way she used me.

122
I just... I get so angry,
just looking at her...

123
- Face.
- Yeah. Yeah.

124
I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...

125
...I see her.

126
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

127
- Maybe this is too weird.
- No, wait.

128
There's only a problem...

129
...when I look at you.

130
I got it. I got it.

131
No, don't tear out your eyes!

132
- I was just gonna take out my lenses.
- Oh, yeah. Try that.

133
So is that better?

134
Not really.

135
You... Ugh. You're blurry.

136
But you still look like Ursula.
You're "Blursula."

137
Okay, wait. Maybe...

138
If I just don't look at you for a while.

139
See? It works.
I'm not angry at all anymore.

140
This is a great date!

141
Look, Eric, turn around.

142
Look, I like you, but it shouldn't
be this hard. It's our first date.

143
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity.

144
And "Ooh, he touched my hand,
did he mean touch my hand?"

145
And, you know, first kisses, and...

146
...second kisses.

147
Thanks for the coffee, or, uh, ahem:

148
Yeah, we're done.

149
"Ezel"? Ezel...

150
Hey, Ross. Listen.

151
You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

152
- Really?
- No, ha, ha.

153
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me, and Chandler.

154
- Sweet!
- All right, finish your coffee. Let's go.

155
I have to stop by my place.

156
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

157
No, no, I have to see
if this apartment became available.

158
- You're switching apartments?
- Not for me, it's for Rachel.

159
- Rachel has an apartment.
- When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

160
- She is?
- Yeah.

161
You didn't expect her
to live there with a baby, did you?

162
I guess I didn't really think about it.

163
Ezel.

164
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel. Huh.

165
Damn it.

166
- Nice jeans.
- Oh, thanks.

167
- I like your top.
- Oh. You're not getting it.

168
- What happened?
- Oh. I fell asleep.

169
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

170
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll really work up your appetite.

171
All right.

172
Hello.

173
What's going on?

174
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

175
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
- How was the game?
- Uh, it was okay. I ate way too much.

177
- Mm.
- Ooh.

178
So, um, I was talking to Ross and he said
you were looking for a new place?

179
Oh, yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

180
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

181
But Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

182
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

183
You could put it over here.

184
Or we could put it right here.
Aw! Cute, right?

185
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

186
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over..."

187
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

188
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

189
Imagine bringing home some girl...

190
...and trying to score
when there's a screaming baby.

191
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

192
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't do that to you.

193
I mean, it would disrupt your entire life.

194
It's just...

195
I love living with you so much.

196
- I wish things didn't have to change.
- I know.

197
You know, I blame Ross for this.

198
- I do too, a little bit.
- Yeah.

199
I'm gonna miss you.

200
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

201
Mm. Ooh.

202
Oh, no, I have to go.
Ugh, I have a massage appointment.

203
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

204
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

205
- I'll see you later?
- Absolutely.

206
I love the way you kiss.

207
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!

208
Heh, you'll see.

209
- Hey.
- Hey! Um...

210
- I think Brenda needs a raise.
- How come?

211
Because I put my head
between her legs.

212
- To see her pants?
- They're my pants!

213
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?

214
No. I was getting into position,
and everything went dark.

215
God, she is not stealing from us, okay?
Will you let this go?

216
Fine.

217
- She's wearing my bra!
- Oh, dear God.

218
My pink flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

219
And yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

220
Here's the plan, okay?

221
I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

222
Here's another plan. No.

223
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

224
- Why?
- Did you not hear where my head was?

225
Come on! We're a team.
We're in this together.

226
I fear a jury will see it the same way.

227
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

228
You see that?

229
Do you see this? Unh...

230
All right. Yes, okay. I get your point.

231
But if it's not her bra,
will you just let the woman clean?

232
Yes. Absolutely. Okay?

233
You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, the lacy part...

234
...there's very a noticeable rip.

235
You need new clothes.

236
- Hi. How is she?
- It's not looking good.

237
Oh? Oh. Aw.

238
Well, I, uh, brought her some bloemen.

239
That's so sweet.

240
Would you like to say goodbye?
I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

241
Oh, I don't know that it would. Heh.

242
- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
- All right, then.

243
- Hey!
- Welcome back.

244
- Should we pick up from where we left off?
- I don't know.

245
I'm still tired from this afternoon.

246
- Why?
- Uh, the sex.

247
- What sex?
- Our sex.

248
We didn't have sex.

249
Well if I didn't have sex with you...

250
...I had sex with somebody
that looked an awful lot like...

251
- Ew. Ew. Ew, ew!
- No, no, no, no!

252
- You had sex with Ursula?
- A little bit.

253
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and...

254
You didn't notice different clothes?

255
- I was just so excited to see you.
- Aw.

256
Ew! Ew! Ew!

257
Ugh! You know what? This is too weird.

258
No. I don't wanna lose you.
It's like I was saying to Ursula...

259
...when I was making love to her
and thought she was you...

260
Yeah. It's too weird.

261
So I guess this is it.

262
Yeah.

263
Maybe it's for the best.

264
- You smell just like her.
- Yeah, so do you.

265
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaning.

266
This is where I lean.

267
Okay.

268
- Brenda, a bee!
- What?

269
Yes, it's flown into your blouse.

270
You better undo your buttons
lest it sting you.

271
- I think I know what's going on here.
- You do?

272
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian...

273
...but it's wrong. You're married.

274
- I totally understand.
- Okay, good. Ha-ha-ha.

275
Could I just see your bra?

276
Hi.

277
- Where'd you get those jeans?
- You gave them to me.

278
- No, I didn't!
- All right, I took them.

279
I figured it was okay,
you've got an ink stain on the crotch.

280
- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
- What bra?

281
- The pink one with the flowers.
- You mean the one you're wearing?

282
I quit!

283
Sounds about right.

284
- What is this?
- Hey.

285
Uh, this is just to give you an idea.

286
We can put screens here
so the baby has privacy...

287
...and maybe a mobile,
you know, over the crib...

288
...and, uh, here's a baby monitor which,
until the baby comes...

289
...we can use as walkie-talkies. Eh?

290
You're so sweet!

291
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

292
Uh...

293
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

294
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion?

295
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

296
- I'm loud.
- It's gonna be up all night.

297
- I'm up all night.
- It's gonna poop.

298
Hello?

299
What about the women
you wanna bring home?

300
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand being around a baby...

301
...then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

302
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

303
- Joey, are you sure?
- Yeah.

304
Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay...

305
...but it'll also be really,
really great.

306
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

307
- I want me to stay too. Thank you.
- Aw.

308
Joey, look at this crib! It's so cute!

309
I know. I found it on the street.

310
Are you...? Really?

311
- This is in such good condition.
- Yeah.

312
Wow. Whoa, what's under the cover?

313
- I don't know.
- It's moving.

314
- Ew.
- Still...

315
- Aah! It's got a tail! Get it out!
- Oh, aah! Okay!

316
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

317
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

318
But I don't care because
you got the apartment. Yes!

319
Ew, yeah.

320
Um, I think I'm gonna stay here.

321
Isn't that great?

322
Ezels!

﻿1
Hey, Pheebs, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow. Wanna come?

2
Sure, yeah, he's kind of sexy.

3
Oh, no, I'll be there too.

4
Okay, so we'll just come up with a signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

5
No, Phoebe,
I just need you there for support.

6
- I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
- Oh. Why not?

7
Because I know he's gonna flip out
and I hate it when he gets angry.

8
Oh, Rachel.
This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
No, Pheeb, wait, he's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

10
He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
he would make me eat the entire pack.

11
- Wow. Well, I will be there.
- Okay.

12
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby.

13
Oh. Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

14
- No, you don't.
- No, you don't.

15
Oh, my God. Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party.

16
Her what?

17
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
- You had a bachelorette party?
- She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
Somebody stop me.

20
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor,
bachelorette parties.

21
You know, we agreed
that it's a silly tradition.

22
It's a grand tradition.

23
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

24
Well, you could have untied it
with your hands.

25
This is so unfair.

26
The one thing I wanted to do
was throw my best friend a bachelor party...

27
...but, oh, I wasn't allowed to.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

28
You went home with the waitress.

29
Ha. Yeah, that was a good night.

30
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

31
You know that the two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.

32
Ugh. I knew giving you that book was
gonna come back and bite me in the ass.

33
How about I order everyone
the Moroccan chicken?

34
Oh, I don't eat meat.

35
It's chicken.

36
- Yeah, I don't eat that either.
- I'll never understand you lesbians.

37
- So, baby, tell me, what is new with you?
- Well, actually, um...

38
- Ahem. Your '74 Lafite, sir.
- Seventy-four?

39
I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
The '74 is sewage.

40
Why would you bring me sewage?

41
Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot?
Is that why you're a waiter?

42
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you tonight.

43
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

44
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

45
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

46
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.

47
- Rachel...
- No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.

48
I'm gonna wait a couple of years
and then the baby will tell him.

49
- Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
- Hey, that is the baby's problem.

50
- Oh. Everything okay with the waiter?
- I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.

51
So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me
what is, uh...? What is new with you?

52
Well...

53
Um...

54
I got TiVo.

55
- What's TiVo?
- It's slang for "pregnant."

56
Phoebe.

57
Are you really pregnant?

58
Well, uh, yes and no.

59
Except, not no.

60
So to sum it up, yeah.

61
Who is the father? Oh, no.
Please don't tell me it's her.

62
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.

63
Oh, Daddy,
I hope you're okay with all this.

64
I mean, think about it, this is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild.

65
You're gonna be a poppy.

66
That's true. I'm a poppy.

67
I'm gonna be a poppy.

68
- So when is the wedding?
- The who?

69
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

70
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard.

71
Rachel Karen Green,
tell me there's gonna be a wedding.

72
February 2nd.

73
So it was cool
seeing you lecture today.

74
Oh, thanks. Although it seemed like
you were falling asleep there a little.

75
Oh, no, I had my eyes closed
so I could concentrate and take it all in.

76
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.

77
- So, um, I gotta get going.
- Okay, I'll see you tonight?

78
- Yeah.
- Okay.

79
Oh, hey, thanks again for showing me
your semi-precious stone collection.

80
It was amazing.

81
My God, you must be good in bed.

82
So you and Mona. It's been a while now.
How's it going?

83
Uh, it's good. It's going good.

84
I mean, we get along great.
She's so...

85
- Hot?
- Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah.

86
And she's okay
with Rachel and the baby?

87
Well, I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off.

88
Well, you have to be honest with her...

89
...otherwise you may think
that you're going down the same path...

90
...but you're really
going down different ones.

91
I'm gonna take that book
and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.

92
Oh, my God,
you are gonna love me so much.

93
I felt really bad about the whole
bachelorette party thing, so tonight...

94
...you're gonna have a bachelor party.
- What?

95
Yeah, I got this number
from this guy at work...

96
...and I hired a stripper
to come dance for you.

97
Am I going in the
wife hall of fame or what?

98
Honey, that's crazy,
I don't you to get me a stripper.

99
Will you let the lady talk?

100
Come on. Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.

101
Look, I appreciate it, but, uh,
it's a little creepy, you know?

102
I'm not a bachelor anymore.

103
So don't think of it as a bachelor party.

104
Think of it as a two-month
anniversary present.

105
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

106
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked.

107
- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.
- Yeah.

108
And Joey.

109
Thank you.
Now, who else do you wanna invite?

110
Uh, no, no, no. Just Ross and Joey
is embarrassing enough.

111
Uh, actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona again tonight.

112
I understand. Who would cancel an actual
date just to go to a fake bachelor party?

113
I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

114
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it
to your imaginary wedding...

115
...but I'm really busy that day.

116
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

117
I know, I know. I panicked. I panicked.

118
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.

119
It's Lafite.

120
The '74 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

121
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.

122
- I just called a friend of mine.
- Yeah.

123
I think I may be able
to book the Plaza on short notice.

124
Really?

125
The Plaza?

126
Oh, Daddy.

127
- Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you please.
- What is it, sweetie?

128
There's not gonna be a wedding.
Ross and I are not getting married.

129
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- I don't believe this.

130
Daddy, stay calm, please.

131
Stay calm?
How do you expect me to stay calm?

132
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And I wanna know why.

133
Is it because that punk Ross
won't marry you?

134
- That's it. Is that it?
- Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

135
So, you, uh,
nervous about getting married?

136
What are you doing?

137
Look, let's pretend
it's a real bachelor party, okay?

138
You know, before your wedding.
It'll be more fun.

139
All right. I can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

140
How's it feel knowing you're never gonna
be with another woman again, huh?

141
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up
to the same face every day...

142
...until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

143
You're right. This is more fun.

144
That's her. Okay, come on.

145
- Hi.
- Hi.

146
So which one of you lucky boys
is Chandler?

147
Uh, that's me.

148
That's me.

149
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

150
- So is that a bedroom?
- Yeah, yeah, right over there.

151
All right. Whenever you're ready.

152
That was weird.

153
- Why would she go in the bedroom?
- I'm waiting.

154
- So she's a...
- Yep, that's one naked hooker.

155
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?

156
Uh, that's an 18th-century
Indian artifact from Calcutta.

157
Oh. Wow.

158
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

159
- So much more.
- Mm.

160
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

161
Ah, forget it. It's from Pier 1.

162
Sorry.

163
You think you can knock up my daughter
and then not marry her?

164
I ought to kill you.

165
You know, this is actually
not a great time for me.

166
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

167
- First you get my Rachel pregnant...
- You got Rachel pregnant?

168
- Who did?
- You did!

169
Yes. Ahem.

170
Yes, yes, I did, but it was
just a one-night thing. It meant nothing.

171
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?

172
No, no, sir. Um, she means a lot to me.
I mean, I love Rachel.

173
- What?
- Oh, but not in that way. Heh.

174
I mean, I'm not in love with her.

175
- I love her like a friend.
- Oh, really? That's how you treat a friend?

176
You get her in trouble and then
you refuse to marry her?

177
- Hey, I offered to marry her.
- What?

178
But I didn't want to.

179
Well, why not? So you could
spend your time with this tramp?

180
Tramp?

181
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

182
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there.

183
Wait, wait.
Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...

184
...but she got confused
about what she's supposed to do.

185
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.

186
Ma'am?

187
Are you also a stripper?

188
Uh, no, but I could pretend to strip.

189
But that's gonna cost extra.

190
Okay, here's the extras:
Handcuffs, spanking...

191
No, no, ha, ha.

192
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

193
You know, getting her own husband
a hooker. That's pretty funny.

194
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

195
I bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was conveniently busy.

196
- Do you mind if I smoke in here?
- Oh, actually, I'd rather... Ahem.

197
Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room down anyway.

198
How could you have kept
all of this from me?

199
- I was going to tell you, but...
- But what?

200
You figured you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like Rachel.

201
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

202
Oh, um...

203
Can I...?

204
Why don't we just let the machine
get that?

205
Hey, Ross, it's Joey.
There's a hooker over here.

206
We thought maybe
you'd know something about it.

207
No. No. No. No. No.

208
I need to lie down.

209
So tonight's the night
of the big bachelor party?

210
Yeah, hey, thanks for giving me
that girl's number.

211
No problem. So who's the party for?

212
- My husband.
- You hired your husband a hooker?

213
- She's a stripper.
- No, she's a hooker.

214
- Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
- When they're hookers.

215
Oh, my God, Stu,
I can't believe you did this.

216
You're absolutely sure she's a hooker?

217
Either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.

218
- Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
- Why would she do that?

219
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

220
Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?

221
This is the worst bachelor party ever.

222
- What's taking you boys so long?
- In a minute.

223
In a minute?
What's gonna happen in a minute?

224
All right, all right.
Maybe you should just ask her to leave.

225
- Why me?
- Hey, it's your bachelor party.

226
- Which is why you should do it.
- I don't want to. You do it.

227
- You do it.
- You do it.

228
All right, rock, paper, scissors
for who has to tell the whore to leave.

229
- What?
- I miss this.

230
I don't think we've actually
done this before.

231
No, I miss hanging out with you.

232
- Well, we still hang out.
- Not like we used to.

233
Remember?
You and me used to be inseparable.

234
Well, now it's like things are different.

235
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

236
Yeah, sure. And, hey, don't get me wrong,
I am so happy for you guys.

237
But I just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

238
Yeah, I miss that too.

239
I'll tell you what, from now on, we'll
make time to hang out with each other.

240
You got it. Come here.

241
Oh, God.

242
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.

243
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a...!

244
Hi. Uh, we spoke on the phone.

245
So your dad dropped by.

246
He's a pleasant man.

247
- Oh, no.
- I better go.

248
Just over here.
I don't wanna miss the fight.

249
Ross, I am so sorry.

250
Okay, I promise I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow in person.

251
Or via e-mail.

252
I don't care about your dad.
I care about Mona.

253
She was there and now
she's totally freaked out.

254
Ugh, okay, I'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail address?

255
Rachel.

256
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.
I swear I'll talk to her.

257
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

258
That's it? You call that a fight? Come on.

259
"We were on a break." "No we weren't."
What happened to you two?

260
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

261
Oh, good. You're here.

262
Yeah, and I was worried
that it was going to be uncomfortable.

263
I know. Mona, just hear me out.

264
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.

265
But I heard that you totally
held your own.

266
You're gonna have to tell me
how you did that.

267
- Focus.
- Okay. Um...

268
Okay, yes, Ross and I used to date.

269
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

270
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

271
- How can I be sure of that?
- Oh, because we drove each other crazy.

272
I mean, he was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.

273
- Trying to date this woman.
- Right.

274
But none of that compared
to how kind and gentle...

275
...and thoughtful he is.

276
You probably shouldn't touch me.

277
You know, I just don't wanna get
in the middle of something so complicated.

278
I get it. But, Mona,
what relationship is not complicated?

279
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

280
Why else would you still be single?

281
I'm so gonna leave right now.

282
Should I leave this open for you too?

283
I'm not sure yet.
Why didn't you just tell me about all this?

284
Because what's going on with Rachel has
nothing to do with how I feel about you.

285
- Well, you still should have told me.
- I know, and I was going to...

286
...but I thought it was better
that you heard it from Rachel's father.

287
Look, I made a mistake...

288
...but it's only because
I really, really like you. Really.

289
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.

290
Forgot my purse. Oh, you guys made up.

291
He's a good kisser, isn't he?

292
I'm going.

293
I swear I didn't know she was a hooker.
I mean...

294
Did you let her smoke in here?

295
Her ass-print is still
on your grandmother's quilt.

296
Do you really want to talk
about smoking?

297
You know what?
I'm gonna make this up to you.

298
I promised you a stripper...

299
...and you're gonna get a stripper.

300
- Monica, wait.
- What?

301
Carry on.

302
If I had to give you up
It's only been a year

303
Now, I got my foot through the door
And I ain't going nowhere

304
It took a while to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time

305
Ooh. These tennis shoes are so tight.

306
- I think I'll take them off.
- Could you not narrate?

307
Gotcha, sailor.

308
Just because
you're not in love with the guy...

309
- Oh, you told your dad the truth.
- About an hour ago.

310
- Wanna go see a movie?
- Yes.

311
Bye, Dad.

312
It's unacceptable, Rachel.
What the hell does love have to do with it?

313
There are more important things
in a marriage than love.

314
You have to think about
the consequences of your decisions.

315
Hey, I do too think about
the consequences of my decisions.

316
Well, what gives you the right to...?

317
Go to hell.

318
Stupid guy on my phone.

﻿1
Hey, Rach, listen.
Did you know that during pregnancy...

2
...your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

3
Oh, my God. Let me see that.

4
You fall for it every time.

5
Hey. Look, I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

6
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute.

7
And look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

8
And then after the baby's born,
they're great for shoplifting melons.

9
Oh, good, you're all here.
Okay, Thanksgiving tomorrow, 4:00.

10
Oh. And guess who I invited? Remember
that guy Will Culvert from high school?

11
- No.
- He was in Ross' class.

12
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Well, really overweight.

13
I mean, I was his thin friend.

14
Wow, I don't remember him.

15
Are you sure you're not talking about
your imaginary boyfriend?

16
No, that was Jared.

17
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

18
Anyway, um, Will's here on business...

19
...and he didn't have a place to go
so I invited him here.

20
Oh, that's nice.

21
Oh, by the way,
he's lost a bunch of weight.

22
I mean, he looks good.
Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous.

23
- I still love Chandler.
- Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.

24
Okay, also, just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.

25
- What?
- Well, Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

26
- Phoebe.
- Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.

27
No, they're not.
They're ugly and stupid and delicious.

28
All right, it's not just Phoebe.
Will's still on a diet...

29
...Chandler doesn't eat
Thanksgiving food...

30
...and Rachel's having
her aversion to poultry.

31
She is?

32
Yeah, remember I had to leave
the other day when you had that chicken?

33
I thought that was just because
I put the whole thing on my hand...

34
...and made it walk across the table.

35
It just doesn't seem worth it to make
a whole turkey for three people.

36
It's a lot of work.

37
But you gotta have turkey
on Thanksgiving.

38
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey
is like Fourth of July with no apple pie.

39
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

40
All right, fine, if it means that much to you,
but there's gonna be a ton left over.

41
No, there won't.
I promise I will finish that turkey.

42
All right, you're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?

43
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani.
This is what we do.

44
We may not be great thinkers
or world leaders.

45
We don't read a lot or run very fast,
but damn it, we can eat.

46
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.

47
Hey, isn't it weird to think about
how next year at this time...

48
...there'll be a little baby at the table?

49
Rachel's.
But good to know where you're at.

50
- Hey.
- Hey.

51
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

52
- Anything I can do to help?
- Actually, there is.

53
Chandler usually helps but he's into
the game so I don't wanna bother him.

54
- Could you help me fold these napkins?
- Sure.

55
I'm gonna go across the hall
to check on the yams.

56
- Okay.
- No, no, no, sweetie. No, not like that.

57
We're not at a barn dance.

58
You wanna fold them like swans.
Like I showed you at Christmas, remember?

59
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

60
- So how's the game?
- I have no idea.

61
What?

62
Yeah, I'm just pretending to watch the game
so I don't have to help out with stuff.

63
I don't believe you. That is brilliant.

64
- And Monica has no idea?
- Nope.

65
Every once in a while
I just yell and scream stuff at the TV.

66
Hey, what...? Hey!

67
- Is your team winning, hon?
- Oh, yeah. Anderson just scored again.

68
There's no Anderson.

69
Oh, I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

70
I don't think I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.

71
- Oh. I didn't know you liked football.
- Well, normally, I don't.

72
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

73
- You like Green Bay?
- Well, it's only like my favorite bay.

74
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Aw, thanks.

76
God, Will, I'm so glad that you came.
You just... You look great.

77
You must've lost like...

78
A hundred and fifty pounds.

79
Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those
Subway sandwich commercials.

80
- A pie.
- Right. Uh, it's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

81
- It's no good. Throw it out.
- You wanna meet some people?

82
This is, uh, my husband, Chandler.
Chandler, this is Will.

83
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but, uh,
I'm really into the game.

84
Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand right next to each other.

85
- This is Phoebe.
- Hi.

86
Hey. Wow.

87
Well done.

88
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Sure.

89
Monica, I can't get over how great
you look. You look stunning.

90
- You look incredible too. You're just so fit.
- I'm watching the game but I'm not deaf.

91
Oh, um, I meant to tell you,
Ross is coming.

92
Ross is coming. Great, I love Ross.

93
Well, good. And Rachel Green too.

94
Oh.

95
- Is there a problem?
- Nope. Uh, it's okay.

96
It's just, uh...

97
God, I hated her.

98
- What?
- I hated her.

99
She was horrible to me in high school.

100
But hey, that was a long time ago.
I'm in a good place.

101
It might be actually fun to see her again.

102
Got any cakes or cookies or something?

103
No, Will. No.

104
You know, it's been a while since we
screamed something. Maybe we should.

105
- Oh, okay. No!
- Oh, come on!

106
Damn you, ref. You burn in hell!

107
Hey, what are you doing?
You gotta save room.

108
You've got almost an entire turkey to eat.

109
Let me explain to you
how the human body works.

110
I have to warm up my stomach first.

111
- Eating chips is like stretching.
- Okay.

112
- Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
- I actually know what you're talking about.

113
And I'm here to tell you something.

114
You can eat and eat and eat,
but nothing will ever fill that void.

115
- Who the hell is this guy?
- This is Will, from high school.

116
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

117
- Will.
- Ross.

118
Hey, you came.
Man, you look incredible. Hot stuff.

119
- Hot stuff?
- It's good to see you, man.

120
Yeah, you too.
Man, so, what are you up to?

121
- I'm a commodities broker.
- Really? That sounds interesting.

122
- Yeah, it's not.
- Oh.

123
- But I'm rich and thin.
- Oh, hey.

124
Man, I don't think I've seen you since, uh,
Lance Davis' graduation party.

125
- That was such a fun night.
- Yeah.

126
Would've been good if we had gotten in,
but still, real fun.

127
God, we were lame back then. Do you
remember how into dinosaurs we were?

128
- Yeah.
- So, what do you do now?

129
So how long are you in town?

130
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

131
Rachel Green.

132
Oh, oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

133
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...
God, I hate her, Ross. I hate her.

134
Will, high school was a long time ago.

135
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

136
My two greatest enemies, Ross:
Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.

137
Oh, my God, Monica. Who is that?

138
- That's Will, from high school.
- Ah. I do not remember him.

139
Wow, really got that
sexy smoldering thing going on.

140
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

141
I think he's trying to mouth something
to me, but I can't make it out.

142
I hate you.

143
- Okay, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

144
- Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
- Oh, so who won?

145
- Green Bay.
- Detroit.

146
- What?
- Well, the Lions technically won.

147
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

148
- Hi. Will, right?
- Right.

149
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Green.

150
- Oh, I remember you.
- Really? Aren't you sweet?

151
I gotta tell you though,
I'm having the hardest time placing you.

152
Oh, oh, hang on. I think I remember you.

153
Did we, um...? Did we fool around
at Lance Davis' graduation party?

154
- You are unbelievable.
- Thank you.

155
Uh, Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And, Will, you sit way over there.

156
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that, no problem.

157
At least give me a challenge.

158
This is Chandler's chicken.

159
This is the turkey.

160
Oh. How big is that?

161
- About 19 pounds.
- It's like me when I was born.

162
All right, who would, uh, like some yams?
Will?

163
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

164
What? Oh, you know what?
Can we please keep the chicken...

165
...and the turkey and everything
on the other side?

166
- The smell is just... Yuck.
- Typical. Ahem.

167
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said it was typical.

168
Typical of you, Rachel Green.

169
Queen Rachel, does whatever she wants
in her little Rachel-land.

170
Seriously, who is this guy?

171
Um, ahem, sorry,
do you have a problem with me?

172
- I don't know. Do I? Do I?
- I think you do.

173
Apparently you were a little mean to him
in high school.

174
- A little mean? You made my life miserable.
- I had no idea. I'm sorry.

175
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

176
Will, but you've worked so hard.

177
- Yams!
- Okay.

178
Uh, Will, I just wanna say that I'm real sorry
for whatever I did to you in high school.

179
Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club.

180
- You had a club?
- That's right.

181
The "I Hate Rachel Green Club."

182
Oh, my God. So, what,
you all just joined together to hate me?

183
- Who else was in this club?
- Me and Ross.

184
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

185
- So you were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
- Yes, he was.

186
No, no.

187
So who else was in this club?

188
Uh, actually, there was also that
exchange student from Thailand.

189
But I don't think he knew what it was.

190
So, Ross, we went out for two years
and you never told me...

191
...you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club."

192
You went out with her? We had a pact.

193
It was in high school.
It's not like it was binding forever.

194
Then why did it have
the word "eternity" in it?

195
Okay, Monica, did you know about this?

196
I swear I didn't. Hey, is that why you guys...

197
...used to go up to your bedroom
and lock the door?

198
- Yeah.
- Huh. A little relieved, I gotta say.

199
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

200
The only reason I joined...

201
- Cofounded.
- Cofounded.

202
Cofounded the club,
was that I was insanely in love with you.

203
Obviously I didn't handle it very well...

204
...but if you think about it,
the "I Hate Rachel Club"...

205
...was really the "I Love Rachel Club."

206
Uh, except that it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

207
Okay, so, what, you guys would just get
together and say mean things about me?

208
- Well, we did a little more than that.
- No, no. No, no. No, no. Heh.

209
What? What else did you do?

210
- We started a rumor.
- What rumor?

211
Oh, come on, Will.
Just take off your shirt and tell us.

212
- Ross?
- Ugh, it was no big deal.

213
Uh, we... We said that...
The rumor was that, um...

214
...you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

215
Ha!

216
- What?
- That's right.

217
We said your parents flipped a coin...

218
...decided to raise you as a girl,
but you still had a hint of a penis.

219
- Oh, my God.
- You started that?

220
- What, you heard that?
- Everyone at our school heard it.

221
Everybody at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?

222
Oh, no.

223
Oh, my God, this is all making
so much sense to me now.

224
This is why Adam Carter
wouldn't go out with me.

225
This is why Billy Tratt
would just stay in this region.

226
Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now,
so that one's not really our fault.

227
- Monica, how come you never told me this?
- I thought it might be true.

228
And I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

229
Joey, stop staring. There's nothing there.
It's not true.

230
- I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
- Oh...

231
You are my Everest.

232
- Joey, you don't have to finish that.
- Oh, yes, I do. Otherwise, what's next?

233
Today I'm just a guy
who can't finish a turkey...

234
...but tomorrow I'm the guy
who eats half a Power Bar...

235
...wraps up the rest and puts it
in the fridge? No.

236
I just gotta change my pants.
What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.

237
Okay. Okay. Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

238
"Dear Rach, you're such a great person."
Not girl, "person."

239
Rach, I think you're reading
a little too much into it.

240
"Dear Rach, you're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."

241
What do you want me to do...

242
...call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?

243
- Yes.
- Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?

244
Oh. Me too.

245
Now, look, I'm not calling anybody, okay?
It was like a million years ago.

246
I don't care how long ago it was.
You told people that I was half and half.

247
You know what? I just wanna point out...

248
...I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

249
That's not totally true.

250
- What?
- What?

251
Well, you did start that rumor
about Ross...

252
...making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

253
How did you know that?

254
- It's true?
- No.

255
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.

256
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out...

257
...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
before he went back to Thailand.

258
I'm sorry, when you were in high school
you made out with a 50-year-old woman?

259
- Hey, she didn't look 50.
- Did she look 16?

260
Oh, there's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

261
Oh.

262
- Wow.
- She didn't photograph well.

263
She probably wasn't familiar
with the process...

264
...having spent most of her life
sitting for oil paintings.

265
So how did this happen?
Did she lure you to an early-bird dinner?

266
I was working late in the library
one afternoon.

267
It was just the two of us.

268
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

269
And one thing led to another.

270
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

271
May she rest in peace.

272
- Didn't she walk with a cane?
- Only when it was damp.

273
I can't believe you told people about this.
Everybody knew?

274
- You know what? I'm back in the club.
- Yeah!

275
- I wanna join.
- What...? Phoebe?

276
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I never got to be
in a club. I didn't go to high school.

277
But three of us would meet
behind a Dumpster to learn French.

278
All right, you know, fine,
you guys can have your stupid little club.

279
But I would just like to say what you did
to me is way worse than what I did to you.

280
- You gave me a teeny weenie.
- Ha, ha, yeah.

281
All right, listen. You're just being silly.

282
Rachel, even with that rumor you were
one of the most popular girls in school.

283
Everyone wanted to be like you.

284
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.

285
Wow.

286
And, Ross,
if it weren't for Rachel's rumor...

287
...I mean, no one in high school
would have even known who you were.

288
- She put you on the map.
- As a romancer of the elderly.

289
Hey, Mrs. Altmann was the kind of woman
you could tell she used to be pretty.

290
The eyes did still sparkle.

291
Hey, guys, this stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.

292
And right now, you got so much more
important stuff going on in your lives.

293
Can't you just let this go?

294
She's right.

295
Yeah, I mean,
we are having a baby together.

296
Hold on.

297
- You got her pregnant?
- Yeah.

298
- Are you getting married?
- No.

299
So you knocked her up
but you're not gonna marry her.

300
Dude.

301
- Anybody?
- Okay.

302
It's exactly how I imagined it would be.

303
All right, where's that turkey?

304
- Joey, those are my maternity pants.
- No, these are my Thanksgiving pants.

305
Well, that's it. I'm done.

306
Whew.

307
Here come the meat sweats.

308
Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.

309
Yes, I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

310
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- No, just nobody press on my stomach.

311
You can keep those pants, by the way.

312
What...? What do you got there?
What is that, pie?

313
- Heh. Yeah, you want some?
- Just cut me a little sliver.

314
A little bigger.

315
Little bigger.

316
What, are you afraid you're gonna run out?
Cut me a real piece.

﻿1
Joey?

2
Oh, my God.

3
Okay.

4
So, uh...

5
...I guess we should
make it official, huh?

6
Uh, look, Rach, I...

7
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross.

8
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey, Joey.

9
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

10
And he brought flowers. Oh, thanks, Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

11
You're weird today.

12
Listen, I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about something.

13
Yeah. Actually, uh, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

14
- Uh, Joey, could you give us a minute?
- No.

15
- What?
- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."

16
- Hi. Hey, look who's here.
- Hey.

17
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

18
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

19
- Hey, where's, uh, Mom?
- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

20
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each.

21
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

22
Okay, wow.

23
Uh, Dad, Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.

24
- But I really want to talk to you.
- I know. I still need to talk to you.

25
But before you guys do that,
I need to talk to you.

26
And, Ross, I need to talk to you.

27
- Oh, and I need to talk to you.
- About what?

28
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.

29
Isn't she beautiful?

30
Look at her, my first grandchild.

31
What about Ben?

32
Well, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

33
Wow.

34
Have, um, you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

35
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

36
Yay, that's so exciting. Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

37
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, sure. Okay.

38
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

39
What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

40
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

41
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

42
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

43
- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

44
Dude, I just did something terrible.

45
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

46
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

47
- What? Why does she think that?
- Because it kind of looked like I did.

48
Again, what?

49
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand...

50
As we all are at some point
during the day.

51
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket...

52
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

53
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

54
- I guess.
- And you did it first?

55
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

56
I know. I know. It's awful.

57
Well, what did she say?

58
She said yes.

59
Does Ross know?

60
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

61
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.
- Ooh, I like that. Yeah.

62
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

63
But you have to do it now before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

64
All right, let's not get carried away.

65
I want a baby.

66
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

67
Come on. If we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.

68
- I think that closet's still available.
- I am so tired.

69
- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
- Deal.

70
Dad, seriously.

71
You know, you really should
see someone about that.

72
Noted.

73
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

74
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

75
Actually, uh...

76
- Hey.
- Hi.

77
- Are you all right?
- Um... Uh...

78
- I think I just got engaged.
- Oh, my God. He did it?

79
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

80
Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

81
I like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.

82
- And you really think this is a good idea?
- I just talked him into it.

83
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

84
- The puppet master gets tired, people.
- Okay.

85
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

86
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

87
Really? Even Ross?

88
Especially Ross.

89
Oh, uh, hey, Pheebs. Uh, you know what?
I'll, uh, come back later.

90
Wow, kind of a full house here. Heh.

91
I guess I'll just... I'll come back.

92
There he goes. Your fiancé.

93
I guess so.

94
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.

95
I can't say I'm surprised.

96
- Dad, what are you doing?
- There are people in there having sex.

97
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

98
- Wanna peek?
- No.

99
Come on.

100
You know what?
I don't like you without Mom.

101
Come on.

102
We're not peeking?

103
Well, I'm peeking.

104
Oh, my God.

105
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

106
Wow.

107
- Hey, uh, is it okay to come in?
- Of course.

108
Oh, Joey, this ring, I...
It's beautiful. I love it.

109
Yeah. Uh, look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.

110
- Hey.
- Hi.

111
- Are you ready to try nursing again?
- Yeah. Hi, Emma.

112
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

113
It's all right, honey.
It takes babies a while to get it.

114
- But don't worry, it'll happen.
- Okay.

115
Yowza.

116
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

117
Dear Lord.

118
- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
- Uh, yeah, look, I think that...

119
Oh, look. She's pulling away again.

120
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

121
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?

122
You know, I don't really know her.

123
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?

124
- Okay.
- Are you kidding me?

125
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

126
I don't know. Maybe she's crazy.

127
- Oh, hey, wait up.
- Hi.

128
Congratulations.

129
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew yet.

130
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit. Heh.

131
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.

132
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.

133
- Heh. What?
- Oh, it's a secret?

134
Oh, goody. Yes. Ooh, we haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.

135
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

136
Are you lying?

137
Is this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

138
I am a doctor.

139
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.

140
All right. Well, me too.

141
- Shh.
- Well, should we wake her up?

142
No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

143
- She's so exhausted.
- And so engaged. Dum-dum-dum.

144
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged.

145
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

146
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

147
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

148
- I didn't give her that ring.
- You didn't?

149
- No.
- So whose ring is it?

150
It's mine.

151
- Is it an engagement ring?
- Yes.

152
- But you didn't give it to her?
- No.

153
- But you were going to propose?
- No.

154
Huh. I might be losing interest in this.

155
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

156
...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

157
But all I wanted to do was see...

158
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

159
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

160
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.

161
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

162
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

163
...throw it on
and just start telling people?

164
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

165
Well, I didn't. I didn't propose.

166
Unless...

167
Did I?

168
I haven't slept in 40 hours and...

169
It does sound
like something I would do.

170
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

171
Ugh. It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

172
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees.

173
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

174
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

175
Hi, Dad.

176
- I can still call you that, right?
- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

177
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

178
- It wasn't fun?
- Why, why, why would you?

179
Look, I just don't want you to think...

180
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

181
Well, I don't think that.

182
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

183
It was a simpler time.

184
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

185
- What?
- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

186
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

187
Well, get back in there.
I'll guard the door.

188
Ha, ha. That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

189
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

190
Daddy.

191
You gotta get at it, princess.

192
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

193
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it.

194
That's how I got my bad hip.

195
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

196
This one time I had my knee
up on the sink, and your mother, she was...

197
Daddy, I don't think we need to hear about
the specific positions you and Mom had.

198
You're right.
This is about your positions.

199
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...

200
...for conceiving a child.

201
- Although it might feel good.
- I don't feel good right now.

202
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

203
You up to the task, sailor?

204
Seriously, sir, my brains,
all over the wall. Heh.

205
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

206
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

207
Joey asked me to marry him.

208
- What?
- Joey proposed to me.

209
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby.
- Well, I said yes.

210
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby.

211
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

212
It is bigger than mine.

213
I know. Days of our Lives,
thank you very much.

214
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

215
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

216
And he loves me so much.

217
Well, do you love him?

218
Sure.

219
- Sure?
- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

220
Honey, the question is...

221
...do you really want to marry Joey?

222
No.

223
No, I don't.

224
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

225
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

226
No. She had the ring on...

227
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

228
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on.
And what did it look like?

229
I didn't look at it.

230
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

231
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

232
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

233
I don't want to hurt her.

234
Okay, look, just do it gently.

235
You're right.

236
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

237
- I can do that.
- Okay.

238
I am a gentle person.

239
Oh, by the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

240
Hey.

241
Listen, I, um...

242
I heard about the engagement.

243
Surprised?

244
And confused.

245
Rach, sweetie, I, um...

246
I didn't propose to you.

247
I know.

248
I don't think you do.

249
You didn't propose to me.

250
Joey did.

251
Poor baby, you're so tired.

252
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

253
Joey didn't propose to you.

254
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

255
Uh...

256
You didn't propose to me.

257
Chandler didn't propose to me.

258
But Joey did.

259
Joey proposed to you?

260
- I can come back.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

261
- Joey, did you propose to her?
- No.

262
- Yes, you did.
- Actually, technically, I didn't.

263
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
- Wait.

264
- You gave her the ring?
- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

265
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

266
- You did, and don't you say you didn't.
- Ah.

267
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

268
- Whoa, you were down on one knee?
- Yeah, that looks bad.

269
But I didn't... I didn't propose.

270
- Then what did happen?
- Yeah, what did happen?

271
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up...

272
...and you thought I was proposing.

273
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

274
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

275
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

276
- Ugh! Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Well, I tried...

277
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

278
Whoa, hey.

279
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You saw her breast?

280
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

281
Joey, then what the hell were you doing
with an engagement ring?

282
It wasn't my ring. It's Ross' ring.

283
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

284
What?

285
- You were gonna propose to me?
- Uh...

286
No.

287
Well, this is awkward.

288
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

289
- But that... I mean, that was all, Rach.
- Dude, step up. I proposed.

290
No, you didn't.

291
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

292
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.

293
- Why don't we give this another try?
- Okay.

294
I can't believe you told her
I was gonna propose.

295
- I can't believe you're not gonna propose.
- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

296
Oh, yeah, dude, I totally understand.

297
Usually after I have a baby with a woman,
I like to slow things down.

298
- Oh, my God.
- What?

299
She's doing it.
She's breast-feeding. Look.

300
Uh-huh. Oh, it's beautiful.

301
I'll come back for her later.

302
- Okay.
- Thank you.

303
- Oh, wow, this feels weird.
- What, good weird?

304
Wonderful weird.

305
You know what, you guys?
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go too.

306
And, uh, I'm sorry about everything.

307
- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

308
It's just that...

309
Man, that kid is going to town.

310
Oh. She's perfect.

311
We're so lucky.

312
We really are.

313
Look, I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are...

314
...but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, I'm...

315
- I've been feeling...
- I know, I know.

316
I've been feeling...

317
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

318
Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, um...

319
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?

320
Yeah. Maybe.

321
Well, good. Okay. Uh, heh...

322
I kind of think, you know, if we... if...

323
You're wearing the ring.

324
What...? What's that?

325
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

326
I'm sorry, what?

327
When you thought Joey proposed...

328
...did you say yes?

329
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

330
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

331
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

332
Thank you.

﻿1
He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle

2
And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

3
But I heard him exclaim
Ere he drove out of sight

4
"Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night."

5
- Wow. That was great.
- Mm-hm.

6
You really wrote that?

7
Uh-huh.

8
- Say goodbye, elves. I'm off to Tulsa.
- Aw.

9
I can't believe you're not gonna be here
for Christmas.

10
You're really not coming back?

11
Yeah, we have this paperwork that
needs to be filed by the end of the year.

12
- If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
- It's so unfair.

13
- You don't even like your job.
- So? Who does?

14
- I like my job.
- I love my job.

15
- I can't wait to go back to work.
- I can't get enough dinosaurs.

16
I'm sorry I won't be here.

17
It's just hard enough not seeing you
during the week...

18
...but for Christmas...

19
If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

20
Thanks.

21
I'll see you New Year's Day.

22
You're not gonna be here
New Year's Eve?

23
- Did I not mention that?
- No.

24
And to all a good night.

25
All right, everybody.
I know that it is Christmas Eve...

26
...and you'd rather be with your families,
but there is no call for writing:

27
"Screw you, Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.

28
By the way,
you can all call me Chandler.

29
- Hey.
- Hey. Where you been?

30
I was, uh, checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.

31
It was really beautiful. They have
all these decorations and this huge tree.

32
And I just thought,
to hell with them, we have to work.

33
So I stole their ham.

34
You hear that?
You may not be with your families...

35
...but at least it's gonna smell like ham
in here.

36
My kid's in a play right now.

37
You know what?
I know what will cheer you guys up.

38
I had a talk with the boys in New York.

39
I told them about all the hard work
you've been doing...

40
...and that a little Christmas bonus
may be in order.

41
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

42
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

43
All right, look, you want me to say it?
This sucks.

44
Being here sucks. This work sucks.

45
Now it feels like Christmas.

46
I'm sorry.

47
Hey, at least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.

48
I have to back to an empty hotel room
and lay down...

49
...on a very questionable bedspread.

50
Then tomorrow morning, you get to have
Christmas morning in your own houses.

51
Which, by the way,
none of you have invited me to.

52
- You can come to my house.
- Ha, ha. No, thanks.

53
- It was a nice pep talk.
- Oh, thanks.

54
I'm actually thinking about becoming
a motivational speaker.

55
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?

56
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.

57
So here's a very special
holiday song...

58
...that I wrote for some
very important people to me.

59
Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap

60
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

61
Said all you need
Is to write them a song

62
They haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

63
No don't sing along

64
Monica, Monica
Have a happy Hanukkah

65
Saw Santa Claus
He said hello to Ross

66
And please tell Joey
Christmas will be snowy

67
And Rachel and Chandler

68
Happy holidays, everybody.

69
Okay, Pheebs, look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.

70
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

71
Yeah.
Chandler, why don't you take a walk?

72
This doesn't concern you.

73
We are looking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.

74
- What? That's terrible.
- No, no. We do it every year.

75
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

76
No. Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily...

77
...minx.

78
Don't worry.
We're gonna search here for an hour...

79
...and then we're gonna go to Joey's
and search. Okay?

80
No, not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.

81
- No, we have to.
- No, you don't have to.

82
And you can't, because I live here too.

83
- Well, then you should look with us.
- Why?

84
Chandler, aren't you worried about
what to get Monica for Christmas?

85
No, I have a great idea
for a present for her.

86
Oh, pfft. That's it? A great idea again?

87
Chandler, that's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present...

88
...two medium presents
and a bunch of little presents...

89
...and you got her one great present?
That's just gonna make her feel bad.

90
Why would you do that to her, Chandler?
Why? Why?

91
- If I helped, we could find them faster.
- That's right.

92
- Ooh, ooh, we have a live one.
- It's a Macy's bag.

93
Yeah.

94
- Oh.
- Ooh. Who's it for?

95
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

96
P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."

97
Rach, these are for you.

98
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

99
No, but with this new car smell,
you'll think you do.

100
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

101
Ah. Toilet seat covers.

102
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

103
You guys.

104
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

105
- You got me a cola drink?
- And... a lemon-lime.

106
Wow. Well, this... This is too much.

107
I feel like I should get you
another sweater.

108
And last, but not least...

109
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

110
Well, hey, Ben.

111
What if the Holiday Armadillo
told you all about the Festival of Lights?

112
Cool.

113
Come on, Ben.

114
Years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees.

115
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

116
- Santa.
- Hey.

117
What are you doing here, Santa?

118
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

119
What are you doing here...

120
...weird turtle-man?

121
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,
your part-Jewish friend.

122
You sent me here to give Ben
some presents.

123
Remember?

124
What?

125
Okay, Ben, why don't you open
some more presents?

126
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

127
There's a sentence I never thought
I'd say.

128
What are you doing?

129
You called everyone and said
you had trouble finding a Santa costume...

130
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

131
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

132
- Why?
- Because...

133
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah.

134
And you're wrecking it.

135
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

136
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

137
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

138
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

139
Santa? Really?

140
- Yeah, is that okay?
- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

141
- No.
- Then it's okay.

142
You know what, everybody?

143
Go home.
You should be with your families.

144
It's bad enough that we're working
New Year's Eve.

145
Did I not tell anyone
about New Year's Eve?

146
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?
Merry Christmas. Go.

147
- Merry Christmas.
- Peace on earth.

148
- Bye.
- Good. Godspeed, good people.

149
- You're not gonna go?
- Nah. I couldn't leave you alone.

150
Oh. Thanks.

151
Besides, I can't leave until that
Christmas party downstairs clears out.

152
There are some pissed-off insurance people
looking for that ham.

153
Ah.

154
- Chandler Bing.
- Hi, honey. We're all here.

155
We just want to wish you
a Merry Christmas.

156
Merry Christmas.

157
Aw, merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

158
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?

159
Uh, well, no, it's just, uh, me and Wendy.

160
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

161
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

162
Mm-hm. About the time you told me
about New Year's Eve.

163
- Where's everybody else?
- I sent them home.

164
Oh, you are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?

165
- Uh... Uh...
- Answer faster. Answer faster.

166
- I don't know.
- Answer better. Answer better.

167
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a, uh, colleague.

168
- What does she do there?
- Oh, she's regional vice president.

169
- She's just below me.
- She did what?

170
Below me.

171
Oh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss Oklahoma?

172
What?

173
Well, she didn't win.

174
All right, well, maybe I should let you...

175
...and the second-prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.

176
Well, second prettiest that year.

177
Of all the girls in Oklahoma,
she's probably...

178
Chandler, stop talking.

179
Honey, there's really
nothing to worry about.

180
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

181
Okay.

182
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

183
- Merry Christmas, you guys.
- Merry Christmas.

184
- The wife says hi.
- Ah. Fun conversation?

185
Ah, well, she's just got
this weird idea that, uh...

186
...just because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.

187
Huh? Really?

188
Hmm. Would that be so terrible?

189
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about...

190
...but you're getting ham
on my only tie.

191
- Whoa, back off, missy.
- Ha, ha. Missy?

192
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.

193
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

194
- You are to me.
- No. No. No.

195
- Look, I'm married.
- So? I'm married.

196
I'm happily married.

197
Oh. What's that like?

198
- Right. So I'm sorry, but...
- Seriously? Happily married?

199
So that phone call before,
that was happy?

200
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.

201
She's entitled to be a little paranoid.

202
Or, in this case, right on the money.

203
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.

204
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.

205
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham stealing and adultery aside.

206
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.

207
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

208
Okay, let me ask you something.

209
If what you and your wife have
is so great...

210
...then why are you spending
Christmas with me?

211
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

212
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

213
You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.

214
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
You and I just made out.

215
- You and I are making out?
- Well, not anymore.

216
- But we don't do that.
- I know. I just thought it would be fun.

217
- How drunk are you?
- Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this.

218
Not so drunk that you should feel guilty
about taking advantage.

219
That's a perfect amount.

220
- You know what's weird?
- What?

221
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

222
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

223
- You wanna get under the covers?
- Uh-huh.

224
Okay.

225
Wow, you are really fast.

226
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

227
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

228
- You want to do it at the same time?
- Count of three?

229
- One.
- Two.

230
Three.

231
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.

232
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

233
So are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?

234
Well, uh, you and I
are just goofing around.

235
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?

236
I don't know if you've ever looked up
the term "goofing around" in the dictionary.

237
Well, I have.

238
And the technical definition
is two friends...

239
...who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex...

240
...and just want to spend
more time together.

241
But if you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me...

242
...then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.

243
I am so bad at this.

244
I think you're better
than you think you are.

245
- Really? Okay. So if...?
- Know when to stop.

246
You know, I sensed that I should stop.

247
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

248
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

249
I can't get married without
something old, something new...

250
...something borrowed, something blue.
- Okay, okay.

251
Here's something blue and new.

252
You are so efficient. I love you.

253
- Let's go.
- No, no, wait.

254
We need something old.

255
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

256
That'll work.

257
I don't think so.

258
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.

259
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

260
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

261
Aw.

262
Okay, one thing at a time.

263
Listen, um...

264
...I've been thinking.

265
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.

266
I mean, you work...
You work really hard for that.

267
- Well...
- Well, you work for that.

268
Look, I've thought about it too.
And...

269
...I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

270
- You do?
- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

271
Yeah, look, when I proposed...

272
...I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.

273
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then...

274
Then that's what we're gonna do.

275
You are so sweet.

276
But wait. What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

277
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.

278
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.

279
- You've thought about that?
- Yeah.

280
- How many kids were we gonna have?
- Uh, four. A boy, twin girls...

281
...and another boy.

282
- What else did you think about?
- Well, heh...

283
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.

284
Like a small place outside the city where
our kids could ride their bikes and stuff.

285
You know, we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar...

286
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

287
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

288
You know what?

289
I don't...
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

290
- Sure you do.
- No.

291
I want everything that you've just said.

292
I want a marriage.

293
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

294
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

295
- Ah! Oh, I love it.
- Really? You're not gonna return it?

296
Well, not this second.

297
Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing.

298
Oh.

299
- Oh, wow, it's so beautiful.
- Wow, it really is.

300
Ah.

301
Wendy's a fat-girl name.

302
Aren't we done with that?

303
Okay, fine. Fine. Let's talk about snow.

304
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa...

305
...where my husband's having sex
on a copying machine?

306
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

307
- Hey.
- Aw.

308
Hey. Look at that.
It's a Christmas miracle.

309
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to be with you.

310
I missed you so much.

311
- Hey, hey, uh, who'd you miss the most?
- Monica.

312
Gotcha.

313
- I never wanna leave you again.
- But I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

314
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.

315
- What?
- What? You...? You really quit your job?

316
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.

317
And why should I be the only one
who doesn't get to do...

318
...what he really wants to do?

319
- Well, what do you really wanna do?
- I have not thought this through.

320
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I should've talked to you first.

321
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great.

322
Thanks.

323
Chandler, your being here is the best
Christmas present I could ever imagine.

324
Aw.

325
- Now give me my real gift.
- Yeah.

326
- Thank you.
- Here, pass those around.

327
Oh, hey.

328
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

329
How did you know?

330
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.

331
I thought it was time we started
thinking about other people.

332
And besides, this gift still says
I love you guys.

333
- Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."
- I don't have a job.

334
Actuary? No.

335
Bookkeeper? Hmm, no.

336
Topless dancer?

337
Hey, you know what I just realized?
You are the sole wage earner.

338
You are the head of the household.
I don't do anything. I'm a kept man.

339
You are.

340
Honey, here's 20 bucks.

341
Go buy yourself something pretty
while I'm at work tomorrow.

﻿1
Hey.

2
Good morning, tiger.

3
I'm making you a big breakfast, so you
can keep up your strength for tonight.

4
You're gonna get me
good and pregnant.

5
I've got nowhere to go this morning.
I'm unemployed.

6
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

7
Well, I just lost my erection.

8
No, I mean, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

9
You're supposed to find
your passion in life.

10
You can be whatever you want
to be now. It's exciting.

11
Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.

12
Hey, wait a second.
I can help you with this.

13
You just need to be organized. We can
make a list of your qualifications...

14
...and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files...

15
Hey, this is where your hyper-organized
pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.

16
I know!

17
My erection is back!

18
Thank you.

19
Ooh, Joey, could I have a sip
of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?

20
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21
Thank you.

22
Uh, Pheebs, have you ever been bitten
by a hungry Italian?

23
I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a little short on cash.

24
Oh, if you want,
I could loan you some money.

25
Oh, no, no, no. I learned never to
borrow money from friends.

26
No. That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.

27
Ooh, hey, how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?

28
- You could do that?
- Yeah, yeah.

29
The pay's pretty good, and you
could do it for as long as you need.

30
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
- Okay, now...

31
I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.

32
- Oh, really?
- No, it is awesome.

33
Hey, guys.

34
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
Oh, wow.

36
Hey, why are you all dressed up?

37
We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren
today to introduce her to everyone.

38
- Doesn't she look cute?
- She sure does.

39
Why does she have a pink bow
taped to her head?

40
If one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"...

41
...I'm gonna whip them
with a car antenna.

42
I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office, huh?

43
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter than,
uh, peasant blouses and A-line skirts.

44
Can I get a blue bow?

45
Okay. I have looked through
a bunch of career guides...

46
...photocopied and highlighted
key passages...

47
...and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.

48
How long was I in there?

49
Okay, let's start with the A's.
Advertising.

50
Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.

51
Well, don't you wanna
look through the rest?

52
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.

53
I'm sorry you had to waste all this time.

54
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?

55
Ooh, now I'll get to use my shredder!

56
I mean, I could write slogans.
I mean, how hard could it be, right?

57
"Cheese.

58
It's milk that you chew."

59
"Crackers. Because your cheese
needs a buddy."

60
"A grape. Because who can get
a watermelon in your mouth?"

61
Oh, I got one.

62
"Socks. Because your family's feet
deserve the best."

63
Honey, leave it to the pros.

64
I actually know someone
in advertising.

65
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.

66
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.

67
"The phone. Bringing you closer
to people who have phones."

68
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."

69
That went well. Almost everybody
knew that she was a girl.

70
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.

71
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.

72
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

73
I'm the hell person
whose office this is.

74
Good one, Rach.

75
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.

76
Excuse me?

77
Oh, your baby's so cute.

78
But why would you put
a pink bow on a boy?

79
Hey, Joey. Look at me.

80
I'm a nurse.

81
- Yes, you are.
- Ha, ha.

82
I think it might be time
for my sponge bath.

83
Sorry, I'm just so used
to hitting on the extras.

84
- So are you excited about your scene?
- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.

85
Oh, relax. Don't be. They'll probably
just make you stand in the background.

86
- Good.
- You. Here, come here. Here.

87
Take this tray, stand on this yellow
mark. You're gonna move on "action."

88
Walk over to the operating table, stop on
the blue mark and put the tray down.

89
Don't walk too fast.

90
But don't dawdle.

91
Okay. Now, what?

92
And, action!

93
- Cut! Cut.
- I'm sorry.

94
- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
- Yeah, well, don't be.

95
Okay, that helps.

96
And, action!

97
Cut!

98
Don't worry about it.
It usually takes me three takes too.

99
Ha-ha-ha. All right, eight.

100
And...

101
...action!

102
So do you have any other
questions about advertising?

103
No. No. But let me show you
what I can do.

104
"Bagels and doughnuts.

105
Round food for every mood."

106
Monica warned me you might do that.

107
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.

108
- Really? That's great.
- It's an unpaid internship.

109
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."

110
Come on, now. Monica has a good job.

111
It's not like you have
a family to support.

112
Actually, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.

113
We're supposed to have sex tonight.

114
Actually, she's probably at home,
naked right now.

115
I tend to keep talking
till somebody stops me.

116
- I can picture her on the bed.
- Stop!

117
Okay.

118
Wait. What do you mean,
you're taking over my job?

119
Well, while you were on your
baby vacation, I was doing your job.

120
A vacation? My idea
of a vacation does not involve...

121
...something sucking on my nipples
until they are raw.

122
Clearly, you've never been
to Sandals Paradise Island.

123
All right. Don't get too comfortable
there, because I'm back in two weeks.

124
I want everything back the way it was.

125
I can't say I care too much for the way
you've rearranged my office.

126
I can't say I care too much
for that smell you've brought in.

127
Excuse me?

128
Uh, Rach, uh,
we have a code brown situation.

129
Honey, could you please
take care of it for me?

130
All right, but you're gonna
have to do one sometime.

131
Let me just get this straight.

132
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?

133
Well, there was talk of shutting down
Ralph Lauren altogether.

134
Okay. Right.
You're very cheeky for a temp.

135
I'm not a temp. I was transferred here
from another department.

136
Oh, and what department was that?
The, uh, jerk department?

137
They didn't tell me
about your quick wit.

138
Well, did they mention that
I'm rubber and you're glue?

139
- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Zelner.

140
Ah, Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.

141
When you left us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.

142
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin. Ha-ha-ha.

143
Well, that's great.

144
So now, uh, Super Gavin,
when I come back...

145
...uh, where do you plan
on flying off to?

146
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.

147
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.

148
Incidentally,
when, uh, are you coming back?

149
Uh, today.

150
- You said two weeks.
- No, I said today.

151
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.

152
- Hey.
- Hey.

153
So, what'd he say?

154
Uh...

155
He can be a little rough
around the edges...

156
...so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."

157
Okay? So he said, "If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together...

158
...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass."

159
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.

160
That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.

161
- You're Nurse With Tray.
- Joey...

162
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.

163
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...

164
...because if she doesn't, people die.

165
Who dies?

166
Man With Eye Patch!

167
Now, you get in there,
and you do your job.

168
- Yes, doctor.
- Okay.

169
Okay, let's try this one more time.

170
Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.

171
And, action.

172
Yes, I did it! I nailed it!

173
Whoo!

174
What's next?

175
The rest of the scene.

176
Okay, from the top, people.

177
Listen, sudden change of plans.
Um, my maternity leave just ended.

178
They said if I didn't
come back today, they'd fire me.

179
What? No, that's illegal.

180
I'll have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't...

181
All right, calm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.

182
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.

183
But what about Emma?
I mean, we don't have a nanny.

184
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a plan tonight.

185
Can you please just take care
of her for today?

186
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.

187
Come on.
I don't know what else to do.

188
- Fine. Fine.
- Okay.

189
We'll have fun, won't we?
Yes, we will. Yes, we...

190
- Ross.
- Huh?

191
You're pretty.

192
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.

193
It's gonna be a while
before I make a living at it.

194
Maybe now's not the right time
to be starting a family.

195
So you have to tell Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?

196
Yeah.

197
Goodbye.

198
Okay, it's baby time. Pants off, Bing.

199
Didn't see you there, Geller.

200
Yeah, Ross is here, so...

201
Uh, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah.

202
Uh, and I was really hoping
that maybe I could hang out.

203
- Mm.
- What do you, uh, feel like doing?

204
Well, uh, we're gonna have sex.

205
I don't feel like having sex.

206
Uh, maybe, uh... I don't know.

207
Maybe we can
watch a movie or something.

208
Uh, let me put it this way:

209
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.

210
Pants off, Bing.

211
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fill me in on what you've been up to?

212
Well, I've changed your screen saver
from that picture of *NSYNC.

213
Hey, they were popular when I left.

214
I'm working on this
big presentation for tomorrow.

215
I should be involved in that,
so get me up to speed.

216
That'll take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.

217
Oh, no. I see what you're
doing here, all right?

218
This is my job, buddy. I've had it for
five years, and I know how it works.

219
- So why don't you just catch me up?
- Fine.

220
Oh, God. You've totally messed
with the back support on my chair.

221
- How do you fix this?
- You've been here five years.

222
- You figure it out.
- Fine, I will.

223
All right, fill me in.

224
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
Do you have a blue tie that would go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.

226
Oh, yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.

227
Of course, by that time,
ties will be obsolete...

228
...and we'll all be wearing
silver jumpsuits.

229
- Hey, good morning, lover.
- Hey.

230
I gotta say, after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.

231
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.

232
Sorry.

233
But I kind of have this feeling that
we may have made a baby last night.

234
Oh, God, I have to tell you something.

235
You're not pregnant.

236
What are you talking about?

237
Well, that thing that I have to do
to make a baby?

238
I faked it.

239
What? You faked it?

240
You know what?

241
I don't need a tie.

242
I mean, it's...
It's better open collar, you know?

243
It's, uh, ahem, it's more casual.

244
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.

245
Yesterday I was a nurse,
and today I'm a waitress at a café?

246
Oh, sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.

247
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorable performance as the nurse.

248
And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.

249
Um, um...

250
Well, maybe you are a nurse...

251
...but you moonlight as a waitress.

252
Oh.

253
Uh-huh.

254
Because I'm a single mother
supporting my two children.

255
- Nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

256
Okay. Wait a minute.

257
Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the
same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?

258
No. No, see, uh,
you and Drake are having a fight.

259
About what?

260
He slept with you
and then never called you.

261
And I just wanted a new daddy
for Davey and Becky.

262
Okay.

263
Okay. Okay, from the top.

264
And, action.

265
So I'm surprised you agreed
to have lunch with me.

266
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.

267
Cut! Cut!

268
What...? What are you doing?

269
I'm very angry at him because he slept
with me and never called me back.

270
- Me too.
- Me too!

271
Oh, calm down.
She means on the show.

272
We need some new extras
around here.

273
Wow. You're here already.

274
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.

275
Actually, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.

276
So ask me anything.

277
- How do you fix the chair?
- Ugh, except that!

278
Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready
for our presentation this afternoon.

279
- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.
- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.

280
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.

281
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.

282
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping. Heh.

283
Well, there you go, you win. You win.

284
You get to do the presentation.
You'll knock them dead.

285
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...

286
...and Super Gavin will just fly
right alongside of him.

287
- You can do the presentation.
- No, I can't. I have a baby.

288
I'll watch her.

289
Why would you do that?

290
Because you worked really hard, and
it's your job. And you're a little crazy.

291
That's really nice.

292
I should tell you that crying women
make me very uncomfortable.

293
Well, you're not gonna like
what's coming.

294
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

295
God.

296
Thank you. Thank you.

297
Um.

298
Okay.

299
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.

300
Okay.

301
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.

302
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.

303
- Okay, but this is her last chance.
- Thank you.

304
How about I do something for you?

305
Tomorrow, uh, I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.

306
Hey, uh, listen, Pheebs.
I was just talking to the director...

307
...and he was thinking maybe
this time you don't hit Drake.

308
You just wait on the tables.

309
I can't do that. I'm an actor.
I have a process.

310
You're a masseuse.
You have a table with a hole in it.

311
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.

312
What?

313
I'm so good in the scene
that I'm stealing focus from you.

314
Well, rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.

315
- Come join me up here.
- Ha-ha-ha.

316
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would
call security. She won't go easy.

317
You faked it?
You couldn't have faked it.

318
Yes, you can. You just make
the faces and the noises.

319
Guys can fake it?

320
Ugh, unbelievable.
The one thing that's ours.

321
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?

322
Well, that's actually why.

323
Look, I'm starting
a whole new career now.

324
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.

325
I'm just saying maybe
we could wait a little while.

326
Like...? Like a month?

327
- Or a year?
- Really? You wanna wait a year?

328
It could be less than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.

329
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

330
It'll probably be more than a year.

331
Wow. I...

332
- I really wanna have a baby.
- Well, yeah, me too.

333
Look, I'll just get my old job back.

334
No, I want you to have
a job that you love...

335
...not statistical analysis
and data reconfiguration.

336
I quit, and you learn what I do?

337
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.

338
Now you're unemployed,
and in a little while...

339
...you'll find a new job
that'll keep you really busy.

340
There's always gonna be
a reason not to do this...

341
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.

342
I guess.

343
I mean, it's always gonna be scary
when we have a baby.

344
It's gonna be really scary.

345
I mean, God, when we have a baby...

346
...there's gonna be so much
that we're not able to control.

347
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.

348
I won't have time to clean it.

349
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...

350
...and messes up all the ribbons?

351
What if there's no room
for a ribbon drawer...

352
...because the baby's stuff
takes up all the space?

353
Where will all the ribbons go?

354
Should we go make a baby
before you change your mind?

355
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

356
Oh, and I promise I will not
fake it this time.

357
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.

358
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.

359
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.

360
I don't care if you are my brother.

361
I'm not your brother.

362
What about my children, Drake? Huh?

363
No! No! No!

364
No! No!

365
God!

﻿1
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
- Where's Mon?
- She's at home...

3
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

4
- And you're not helping?
- I tried...

5
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"
in a helium voice, not helping.

6
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

7
Happy birth...

8
Shh. Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

9
Uh, good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

10
- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
- Hi.

11
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.

12
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

13
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.

14
- No, you stay. I'll do it.
- Okay. Thank you.

15
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Yeah, you too.

16
- Wow, Molly's just great.
- Yeah.

17
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

18
- What? You really think she's hot?
- Are you kidding?

19
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

20
Joey?

21
How do you think she's doing?

22
Am I the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

23
- Ah, I mean, she's not unattractive, but...
- Right.

24
...but hot? Ah...

25
Thank you. Ha, ha.

26
Now that Rachel's gone?

27
So hot,
I cried myself to sleep last night.

28
Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?

29
- Lima.
- No.

30
It starts with a V and ends with an X.

31
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

32
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

33
- Oh, God!
- What?

34
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything...

35
...but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.

36
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

37
Well, he's your pet rat?

38
Well, not so much a pet as,
you know, an occasional visitor...

39
...who I put food out for.
You know, kind of like Santa.

40
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

41
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're extremely unsanitary.

42
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

43
- What are those?
- I don't know...

44
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

45
- You have to get rid of it.
- Okay, fine.

46
If it means that much to you,
I'll get rid of Bob.

47
Thank you.

48
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

49
- Hello.
- Hello.

50
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again...

51
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

52
I really owe you an apology.

53
- For what?
- When we first met, you know...

54
...I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

55
Is this your first apology?

56
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

57
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

58
- Morning.
- Hello.

59
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

60
I am just really, really happy...

61
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

62
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.

63
- What?
- I was giving you an apology...

64
...and you were totally checking her out.

65
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.

66
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

67
Wow, you are really...
You're really a creep.

68
What do you even care
if I was looking at her?

69
Are you jealous?

70
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

71
"Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass."

72
Stop looking at my ass.

73
I mean, I just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

74
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

75
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

76
That is totally different for two reasons.

77
One, I didn't know that you knew that.

78
And two, I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

79
We had a... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

80
Huh. What was Tag's last name?

81
It was...

82
Oh, my God.

83
He didn't have a last name.

84
It was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

85
...you know, Moses.

86
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

87
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

88
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

89
- Tag's last name was Morgan! Ha!
- It was Jones.

90
What are you, his boyfriend?

91
- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
- You mean when you were a baby?

92
Sure.

93
Would you stop staring at her?

94
I wasn't staring.

95
I was leering.

96
What's the big deal with her?

97
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

98
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

99
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

100
Me, I like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

101
Makes me feel like I earned it.

102
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

103
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

104
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

105
- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
- Okay, I'll be home right after work.

106
- Okay.
- Okay, bye, Emma-wemma-demma.

107
I lovey-wovey-dove you.

108
- Bye.
- Bye.

109
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

110
It's not so good.

111
I think it's sweet.

112
Bye, Emma-wemma!

113
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

114
Why not?

115
Because it took months
to find a good nanny.

116
And I wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

117
So you think I'm just
gonna sleep with her...

118
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

119
Yeah, that sounds about right.

120
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there, okay?

121
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

122
Oh, man. What'd you have to go
and say that for?

123
Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

124
- What are you, a child?
- Yes.

125
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

126
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

127
Fine.

128
Take me home.

129
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Pheeb.

130
- What are you doing?
- Setting rattraps.

131
- To kill Bob?
- No. No, to test his neck strength.

132
But no, I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him...

133
...and, you know,
set him free in the countryside...

134
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

135
...and a wisecracking owl.

136
- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.
- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

137
Bob? Bob?

138
Robert?

139
Wait, I think I hear him.

140
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

141
We'll have to think of a new name.

142
Oh, I don't know,
I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

143
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...

144
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

145
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

146
Susie?

147
What's up?

148
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

149
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.

150
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

151
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

152
- You don't trust him?
- Well, no.

153
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

154
...and asked for her daughter,
uh, the "hot nanny."

155
Is this really your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

156
Because I could get a job any day now.

157
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

158
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

159
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

160
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

161
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

162
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

163
Well, I mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

164
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

165
- Picturing that tree?
- I am, yes.

166
Where you going, Joe?

167
For a walk.

168
Oh, you mind if I join you?

169
Actually, uh, I'd rather be alone. You know,
I really need to organize my thoughts.

170
Your thoughts?

171
Plural?

172
All right, fine. I only have one thought.

173
It's about the hot nanny. I gotta see her.

174
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
- Now you're telling me I can't see her?

175
You guys are killing me.
She's forbidden fruit. It's like, like...

176
Like she's the princess
and I'm the stable boy.

177
Why are you doing this, huh?

178
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

179
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.

180
Huh. Interesting.
Now there are obstacles.

181
Hot nanny and me against the world.

182
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

183
- Great novels?
- Fine. Mediocre porn.

184
- Gavin Mitchell's office.
- Rachel Green's office.

185
Give me that phone.

186
Hello, this is Rachel Green.
How can I help you?

187
Uh-huh. Okay, then.
I'll pass you back to your son.

188
Hey, Mom. No, that's just my secretary.

189
Um, excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.

190
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.

191
- Yes?
- If you like looking at butts so much...

192
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

193
Thank God you finally said that.

194
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

195
- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?
- Oh, no. Please...

196
...I don't care about you
enough to bug me.

197
In fact, from now on,
I'm going to take the high road...

198
...and I'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

199
...starting right now.

200
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

201
- Ready for your birthday lunch?
- I am.

202
But first, Monica,
I would like to introduce you...

203
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

204
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

205
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

206
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

207
Oh, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

208
...most likely with his mother.

209
I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

210
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy.

211
- You were being so nice to him.
- I was faking it.

212
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

213
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

214
- Right there. That was so fake!
- Shh!

215
Oh, hi.

216
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

217
I mean, he is just the last person
I want to see.

218
You're welcome for the party.
I'm glad you're having a good time.

219
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course
he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.

220
- Does he?
- What?

221
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

222
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

223
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

224
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

225
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

226
- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

227
Bye, sweetheart.

228
Do you see what all the guys see in her?

229
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

230
No more vodka for me.

231
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
"Happy Birthday" to you now?

232
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh. All right.

233
Happy birth...

234
See you later.

235
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

236
Give me.

237
- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
- Careful! Careful!

238
These are my rat babies!

239
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

240
Oh, you brought rats
to my birthday party?

241
So this is what a stroke feels like.

242
Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

243
They're our responsibility now.

244
You know, they require constant care.

245
You should know that, Rachel,
you're a mother.

246
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?

247
No. Seven rats.

248
I think we should take them home.
We need to feed them.

249
Wait, you're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

250
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,
but I'm not like you. Okay?

251
Not everyone can afford help.

252
Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly?

253
I asked you to watch them.

254
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.

255
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

256
Right behind you, big guy.

257
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

258
...is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.

259
- So where'd you study?
- Oh, I didn't go to college.

260
- No, where'd you study acting?
- Molly, people don't study acting.

261
Molly, uh, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

262
- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.
- Thanks.

263
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

264
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

265
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

266
This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sleep with her...

267
...and then blow her off, huh?

268
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that I actually like her...

269
...and might want something real?

270
Look, the truth is I haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

271
Okay?
I didn't think I could ever love again.

272
- Come on.
- Joe.

273
Hi. Is Molly here?

274
Uh, yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

275
- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
- Hey.

276
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

277
Uh, well, Joey, I guess
we have no problem.

278
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.

279
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

280
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

281
...and I'll start changing the box.

282
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

283
When did we become
one of those couples...

284
...whose lives revolve around their rats?

285
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

286
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

287
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

288
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

289
Yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats.

290
No, they're more of a "love the one
you're with" kind of animal.

291
No. Really?

292
Oh, my... Get off your sister! Ew.

293
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

294
- The... We have seven rats.
- Uh-huh.

295
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

296
...and then each of those
have seven rats? That's like...

297
That's math I can't even do.

298
What are we gonna do?

299
Well, I know this is gonna
sound crazy...

300
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

301
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

302
All right, so we should just
give them away.

303
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

304
Those were Bob's favorites.

305
It's gonna be okay.

306
- You must think I'm crazy.
- No, I think you're sweet.

307
Good.

308
This is just so hard.

309
It's hard for me to let them go.

310
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

311
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
triplets and I had to give them up.

312
I haven't told you about that yet, have I?

313
- Hey.
- Hi.

314
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should I help you clean up?

315
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.

316
- Is everything all right?
- I just get bummed...

317
...when my birthday's over.

318
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

319
- Mm?
- That jerk, Gavin, from your office...

320
...didn't show up.
- Ah.

321
Yeah, I hate him.

322
We weren't talking about you.
We were...

323
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

324
- Fun party.
- Well, it was.

325
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at...

326
Nine-thirty? God.
Ugh, this party was lame.

327
Again, you're welcome.

328
- Look, I'll just give you this and go.
- Oh, you bought me a present. Why?

329
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

330
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

331
Okay, I, uh...

332
I got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

333
Aw. Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

334
- "From Gavin."
- I really mean it.

335
Oh. Oh.

336
Oh, it's beautiful.

337
- If you don't mind? Let me.
- No.

338
Well, what do you know, it fits.

339
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

340
Why do you give me such a hard time?

341
I'm not sure.

342
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

343
I do have feelings for you.

344
- You do?
- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.

345
See, why? Gavin, why?

346
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you...

347
And you do that.

348
First I was afraid, I was petrified

349
- Hey.
- Hi.

350
Listen, um, I think I left something here.

351
Oh. Uh, well, somebody left this.
Is this yours?

352
Oh. No, but I like it.

353
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.

354
Oh. Uh, well, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'll let you know.

355
Aah! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

356
Maybe that's him.

﻿1
- Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
Look, can we talk
about what happened here last night?

3
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.

4
You believe that whoever did something
last night did what they did or didn't do?

5
Okay, you really don't know
what I'm talking about?

6
- No.
- Okay. Last night, after the party...

7
...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.

8
Our balcony? Seriously?

9
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony...

10
...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there." And I said:

11
"Maybe if we put some lights
out there they will."

12
Right, that's what I came over to talk
about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...

13
...on your balcony,
even though there were no lights!

14
So are you gonna talk to her?

15
Why? Why should I? I mean,
if she wants to move on, that's fine.

16
You know when "that's fine" sounds
true? When someone yells it and spits.

17
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date people, fine. I don't care.

18
But at least she could have told me.

19
You know, I've been putting my life on
hold and concentrating on Emma.

20
But if she wants to go out there kissing
guys she barely knows, then so will I.

21
Very funny! Ross is gay! Ha, ha.

22
No, no.
Good, so you're moving on.

23
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?

24
I've got plenty of opportunities.

25
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

26
And then the other day on the subway,
a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.

27
Dude, don't rub my face
in your crazy single life.

28
And there's an anthropologist
atschooL"

29
...who totally came on to me during
the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

30
Why did I get married?

31
Hey, let me ask you guys something.

32
I'm having new headshots
taken tomorrow.

33
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.

34
Is that weird for a guy?

35
- Well, it depends.
- On?

36
On how far along he is
in the sex-change process.

37
No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine
for a guy to do something like that.

38
Especially an actor.

39
I mean, not that you need to.
Your eyebrows are...

40
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.

41
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

42
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?

43
- Wow, talk about high maintenance.
- You dye your hair.

44
- I'm a woman.
- Double standards!

45
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?

46
- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
- But everybody sings. It's so fun.

47
Last time, this adorable old man got up
there, forgot all the words, flipped out...

48
...and everyone booed him off the stage.
It was so funny.

49
Look, I'm not good at singing.

50
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?

51
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?

52
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

53
Wow, I must be growing up.

54
Okay, fine. Just please come and
support Mike. You don't have to sing.

55
So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit
there and pass judgment on others?

56
- While drinking.
- I'm there.

57
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I really need your help.

58
I think I did something
really stupid.

59
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something
so beautiful out of it.

60
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin last night.

61
- My God.
- You kissed him?

62
Yeah, it was after the party,
we were on the balcony...

63
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home
the whole time. How did I miss that?

64
Well, it was the end of the party. You
were probably ironing wrapping paper.

65
Oh, yeah.

66
So how did you end up kissing?

67
We were all alone
and he was being really nice...

68
- ...and he gave me this scarf.
- I thought you hated him.

69
Well, there is a thin line
between love and hate...

70
...and it turns out that line
is a scarf.

71
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?

72
I don't know. It's so complicated.
I work with this guy.

73
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.

74
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

75
Sounds like you need to think
about what you want and talk to Gavin.

76
- And you definitely should talk to Ross.
- Or...

77
...I could call in sick
and not deal with it at all.

78
Wow! Five months maternity leave,
you're back for four days...

79
...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.

80
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
- I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
- Name?

82
Chandler Bing.

83
Okay, very good.

84
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.

85
- Okay. Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

86
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

87
Uh-oh.

88
I touched the stuff.

89
I'll take care of it.

90
Thanks.

91
So do you...?
Do you get a lot of guys in here?

92
- Oh, absolutely.
- Oh, good.

93
- You looking to meet somebody?
- All right, let's just do this.

94
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

95
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?

96
- Now, this may sting just a little bit.
- I have an extremely high threshold...

97
Holy Mother of God!
Oh, my face! My face!

98
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

99
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

100
- But I'll be fine. You can go again.
- Okay.

101
Sorry.

102
Damn it, woman!

103
QW, ow! Oh!

104
Okay.

105
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

106
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?

107
Not well. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...

108
...but that person was neither female
nor wearing pants.

109
Maybe you're going about this
the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

110
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.

111
The personal ad writes itself.

112
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?

113
What are you doing?
You know I can only dish it out.

114
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.

115
Maybe she didn't move on.

116
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.

117
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.

118
- Did she go out with him?
- No. When he called...

119
...I threw the message away.

120
Ah, the highroad.

121
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.

122
Hey, check out those two blonds
over there. Hey, come with me.

123
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?

124
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

125
Like college, remember? First, you
break the ice with some kind of a joke...

126
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...

127
...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,
brooding sexy one.

128
I thought I got to make the jokes.

129
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Oh, come on.

130
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.

131
We were wondering...

132
...if you're up for it, we only need
six more people for a human pyramid.

133
Swoop. Swoop.

134
Uh... So, um...

135
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.

136
Another flood in Europe, huh?

137
Um, here's a question:

138
Would you rather drown
or be burned alive?

139
- I'm sorry, we're just leaving.
- Okay.

140
We still got it.

141
- Who is it?
- Gavin. I brought you some soup.

142
- Why?
- Uh, I heard your were sick.

143
Oh, right! Hold on,
let me just clean up in here a little bit.

144
Hello, Gavin.

145
I missed you at work.
How you feeling?

146
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

147
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totally paranoid moment...

148
...where I thought you
called in sick to avoid me.

149
Oh, no, no, no.

150
So I had fun last night.

151
So did I.

152
Exactly how contagious
is this thing you have?

153
Is it a cold from standing on
the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?

154
- It's just a cold.
- Do you have a fever?

155
Let me see.

156
Um...

157
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

158
What's Ross doing to you
in that picture?

159
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

160
He thought it would be funny.

161
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

162
- Ross.
- Yeah.

163
What's the deal with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middle of anything.

164
Oh, you're not getting in the middle
of anything. Don't worry about Ross.

165
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!

166
- Hide! Hide!
- Yeah, but you said not to worry...

167
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!

168
- Hi.
- Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.

169
No. I'm here to take Emma
to your mother's, remember?

170
Right. Yes, yes.

171
- Don't panic.
- What?

172
There is a man behind your curtain.

173
- I have Mace in my purse.
- No, that's okay! No, no, no.

174
This is my business associate Gavin
being silly. Come out from behind there.

175
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

176
It was my idea to stand there.

177
- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.
- Okay.

178
So...

179
- ...why did I have to hide?
- I thought it was Ross.

180
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.

181
There isn't. There totally isn't.

182
You hear keys in the hall and you jump
like a bronco coming out of the chute.

183
I used to be a rodeo clown.

184
Um, all right, look, Gavin...

185
...I guess I felt guilty
that you were here...

186
...Which I shouldn't.

187
You know, Ross and I
are not in a relationship...

188
...but he is the father of my child.
And, you know...

189
...we do live together. And plus,
there's just so much history, you know?

190
It's just... I don't know.

191
- I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
- It's okay.

192
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

193
- Yes.
- You should talk to Ross about all this.

194
People keep saying that.

195
Oh, I'm sorry, Gavin.

196
Don't be.

197
It's just bad timing.

198
So seriously, rodeo clown?

199
One of the best, ma'am.
One of the best.

200
No time for losers

201
'Cause we are the champions

202
Of the world

203
Oh, she's my girlfriend.
That's not just how we do it here.

204
I'm gonna take a little break,
and when we come back...

205
...we've got Kenneth singing
"I Touch Myself."

206
I'm not here to judge.

207
- You have got to sing.
- No, I told you I can't.

208
But you would have so much fun.
And you have a really nice voice.

209
- When have you heard me sing?
- All the time, when you're cooking.

210
- What?
- Yeah, you're always singing:

211
"Yummy, yummy, yummy,
I've got love in my tummy."

212
Yeah, I do rock that one.

213
Isn't there just a little part of you
that wants to get up there?

214
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.

215
I don't even know what I would sing.

216
- Well, I've got a book around...
- "Delta Dawn."

217
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.

218
You already hit on me an hour ago.

219
Right. So that's a firm no?

220
I don't believe this.
I just keep striking out.

221
I don't get it either.

222
I mean, you're obviously desperate.

223
You're asking women
how they wanna be killed.

224
This is great.
Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...

225
...until she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die alone.

226
By drowning or...?

227
- Why would he break up with me?
- I don't know, sweetie.

228
All I ever wanted was to just love him
and have him love me back.

229
I mean, am I so unlovable?

230
- Wow.
- I know.

231
All right. That was Kenneth with his...

232
...much too literal rendition
of "I Touch Myself."

233
Coming up next, we've got Monica
singing "Delta Dawn."

234
Wait. I can't sing in
front of all these people.

235
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.

236
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so
bright, you won't see anyone anyway.

237
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
to be singing "Delta Dawn."

238
Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?

239
Could it be a faded rose
From days gone by?

240
- Can you totally see through her shirt?
- Like an x-ray.

241
Bad day not to wear a bra.

242
Take me to that mansion in the sky

243
Hey.

244
I need your help.

245
Wow, it seems serious.

246
What seems to be the problem,
Ashley Judd?

247
I'm getting new headshots taken.
So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.

248
I'm sorry.
Moment to make fun of that, please.

249
I may be a sissy, but I'll still
pound you into the ground.

250
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only
let her do one eyebrow, and now...

251
...they don't match!

252
It's like a baby caterpillar
chasing its mama.

253
You gotta help me out, okay?
Look, I have a magic marker.

254
Fill in the skinny one
so I don't look stupid for my pictures.

255
Okay, first of all, this is green.

256
- What the hell am I supposed to do?!
- I will help you out...

257
...but you have to promise you won't
tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.

258
What? What?

259
Okay.

260
You know how most kids get their
allowance from mowing the lawn...

261
...or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine...

262
...by plucking the eyebrows of my father
and his "business partners."

263
Oh, my God.

264
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need
my help, Victor-Victoria.

265
No, no, no. I do. I do.
I need your help.

266
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take
any more plucking. It hurt so bad.

267
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aloe vera and my gentle...

268
...self-loathing touch.

269
Take me to that mansion in the sky

270
Aww...

271
I'm sorry, the song's over.

272
- Did you see me up there?
- Every little bit of you.

273
I can't believe I sang
in front of people and they liked me.

274
Did you hear that guy shouting,
"Look at those tips"?

275
I mean, did I really help
you get a lot of tips?

276
Sure.

277
- Mon, not that you didn't sound good...
- Good?

278
Didn't you hear them? I was great!

279
Thank you so much for making me
do this. That is the best gift ever.

280
Also a good gift: underwear.

281
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

282
Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, let alone do anything else.

283
But what's great is, you don't
mind talking about it.

284
It is so amazing that I met you on the
same day that Eric broke up with me...

285
...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.

286
Uh-huh.

287
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.

288
Phew.

289
Good choice, Ross.

290
Oh, hey. Hi. There you are.

291
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Hello. Well, here I am.

292
My mom is not bringing
the baby back until 9:00.

293
So I was hoping you and I
could have a chance to kind of...

294
- Somebody here?
- Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.

295
- Who?
- Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.

296
- You've been seeing someone?
- Yeah, didn't I mention that?

297
I mean, we haven't been
going out too long...

298
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.

299
I mean, in fact just before you came in
she called me her boyfriend.

300
I thought it was a little too soon,
but also, it felt kind of nice.

301
What are you taking amoxicillin for?

302
How great is this?
You're already comfortable enough...

303
...to look through my stuff.

304
I'm sorry, Michelle,
this is my roommate, Rachel.

305
And I'm also Emma's mother.

306
- Who's Emma?
- I told you about my daughter.

307
This is your daughter?

308
I could be your new mommy.

309
And done.

310
Oh, my God.

311
I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, are you still looking for a job?

312
Because you could tweeze circles
around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

313
- Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
- Yeah.

314
Hey!

315
They totally match. They look great.

316
They look great. How you doing?

317
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was...

318
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...

319
...but it turned out to be
a little piece of chocolate.

320
- Chandler, thank you so much.
- No problem.

321
Listen, that was a pretty
girlie hour we just spent.

322
We should do something manly
to make up for it.

323
Yeah.

324
- Curl my eyelashes.
- Yeah!

325
For my next song, I think I'll sing
something a little more upbeat, all right?

326
Oh, how about the Pointer Sisters'
"I'm So Excited"?

327
And make it bouncy.

328
Well, you can probably take care of that
on your end.

329
I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand
when you see Joey.

330
Honey, you're just in time.
I'm about to sing another song.

331
- Really? In front of all these people?
- And they love me.

332
- Oh, my God.
- She gives the people what they want.

333
All right, watch.

334
Tonight, tonight we're gonna
Make it happen

335
Tonight we'll put all other things aside

336
Get in this time
And show me some affection

337
Are those my wife's nipples?

338
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.

339
I've got to stop this.

340
Wrap myself around you...

341
Yeah!

342
Oh, who cares? They still love me.

343
You, touching yourself! Out!

344
Wow! She does that a lot.

345
Ross, you didn't tell me
you were a doctor.

346
Wait a minute. You haven't even
told her you are a doctor yet?

347
How long have you known her,
like an hour?

348
Actually, about an hour and a half.

349
I told you it wasn't long, but there's
an amazing connection between us.

350
You feel that too? Oh!

351
- I thought that that was just me.
- Are you kidding?

352
- Do you wanna go away this weekend?
- We'll see.

353
Ross, what's going on here?

354
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?

355
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on balconies?

356
- How do you know about that?
- Through the magic of sight.

357
- I was here, putting our child to sleep...
- Emma.

358
When I looked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...

359
...you've known for what, a week?

360
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?

361
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...

362
- ...because of the doody parasites.
- Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.

363
- Well, call me.
- Okay.

364
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.

365
You know what?
If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.

366
Bye-bye.

367
Score.

368
Did you not like her? Because I was
hoping we could come...

369
...to your kissing parties
on the balcony.

370
I can't believe you are making a big deal
about this. It was one kiss!

371
- One guy. One time!
- Oh, really?

372
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

373
Oh, yeah.

374
- What about the guy from the bar?
- Who?

375
The guy you gave your number to.

376
- How do you know about that?
- Because he called here looking for you.

377
So don't tell me kissing this guy
from work is a one-time thing.

378
Because you've been out there
in bars and on balconies...

379
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

380
- Why didn't I get that message?
- What?

381
From the guy in the bar?
Why didn't I get that message?

382
Because I folded it up
and put it in my pants pocket.

383
Do you...? Do you not look there?

384
Ross.

385
I never gave it to you.

386
Why?

387
- I don't know.
- Oh, God, you know what? I don't...

388
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...

389
...what messages
I should or should not get?!

390
Who am I? I'm the guy
who's taking care of our baby...

391
- ...while you're at bars meeting guys!
- I cannot believe you.

392
I actually came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation about us.

393
But I can't do that with someone
who hides my messages...

394
...and brings crazy women
back to my apartment!

395
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!

396
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

397
...you are the one who moved on
and didn't tell anyone.

398
Oh, God, Ross,
this is just so messed up.

399
What is wrong with us? When people
hear about our situation, they ask:

400
"You live together, but you're not
a couple, yet you have a baby?

401
Isn't that weird?" And I say,
"No. It's not, because it works for us."

402
But you know what?
This doesn't work.

403
- In fact, this is the opposite of working.
- Clearly.

404
And you know...

405
...we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense...

406
...and maybe this
just doesn't make sense anymore.

407
Yeah, maybe not.

408
So, what do you wanna do?

409
- Hey.
- Hi.

410
Can Emma and I live here for a while?

411
God. Uh...

412
- Of course.
- Thank you.

413
Your eyebrows look weird.

414
Jeremiah was a bullfrog

415
Was a good friend of mine

416
Never understood a single word he said

417
But I helped him drink his wine

418
So you'll just touch yourself
for anything, then?

﻿1
- Morning, roomie.
- Hey!

2
You remembered
to put clothes on this morning.

3
- Fifth day's the charm.
- Oh.

4
It's so great to be back here. You're
making it so easy on me and Emma.

5
It's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.

6
And when does she stop
crying all night?

7
Hey! You're not naked. Heh.

8
So, hey, Rach, when will we expect
to see you tonight?

9
I'll probably be back around 6.
But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.

10
But she did fall back to sleep, so...

11
She's probably exhausted from all that
adorable screaming she did last night.

12
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it
too hard on you.

14
No, hey, it's been great.

15
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16
I want you to know that
with Rachel staying here...

17
...all my feelings from before
are totally over.

18
And even if they weren't...

19
...when you walk in
on a woman using a breast pump...

20
- Yeah, that'll do it.
- Wow.

21
So how are you?

22
- I'm okay.
- Really?

23
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachel
living together would have worked out?

24
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.

25
- Well, actually it...
- It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

26
Anyway, I think Rachel and I
need to get on with our lives.

27
Maybe start seeing other people.

28
Wow. Really?

29
Sure, why not? In fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me?

30
- Sure. I know lots of girls.
- Yeah? Any names come to mind?

31
Ooh. Names?

32
- Hey.
- Hey.

33
- I was just gonna eat. Want something?
- What you got?

34
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
strained carrots...

35
...ooh, strained plums.
We haven't tried that yet.

36
Goody!

37
Thanks. Ha, ha.

38
So how is it living with Rachel again?

39
- I mean, apart from the great food?
- Ha, ha.

40
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...

41
It's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.

42
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
with somebody.

43
Rachel asked me
if I knew anyone for her too.

44
- Why are they doing this?
- I don't know.

45
They're so perfect for each other.
It's crazy.

46
You know what's crazy? These jars.

47
What is there, like, two bites in here?

48
I just wish they'd realize
they should be together.

49
When they moved in together, I figured
that's where things were headed.

50
They should be a family. They should
marry and have more children.

51
Yes. And they should name
one of their kids Joey.

52
I may not have kids. Someone's
gotta carry on the family name.

53
You know what? Maybe once they
start dating and see what's out there...

54
...they'll realize how good
they are for each other.

55
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

56
- I had this date last night. Yuck!
- Mm.

57
But we should probably keep it down,
she's still in the bedroom.

58
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
just gonna set them up with people?

59
I know, that just pushes them
further and further apart.

60
I know what we can do. We could set
Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

61
...so they'll realize
how good they are together.

62
- Ooh, that's a great plan.
- Yeah.

63
You know what the best part of it is?
I get to do my plan laugh:

64
Okay. Shh, shh. Not so loud.
We don't wanna wake up, uh...

65
Hi. You guys aren't
doing anything tonight, are you?

66
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?

67
I mean, I will have you know
that we are very hip, happening people.

68
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to reading the obituaries.

69
I was just asking because I need
someone to watch Emma tonight.

70
Sure we'll do it.
What are you up to?

71
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.

72
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

73
- Why? What's the big deal?
- I figured because you and Ross are...

74
What? Slept together a year
and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

75
I think it's great you're going on a date.
It sounds healthy.

76
I mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.

77
You want a job? Turn off Oprah
and send out a résumé.

78
- I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
- That's perfect.

79
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.

80
A couple things. Now that she eats
solid food, she poops around the clock.

81
And watch out for your hair
because she likes to grab it.

82
She's also in this phase where if you
leave the room, she screams, but, oh...

83
...thanks, you guys. Have fun.

84
Suddenly I wish I was reading
my own name.

85
- Ooh, Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
- Hey.

86
- I just set Rachel up with the worst guy.
- All right. Who is he?

87
It's this guy I used to massage.
By "massage"...

88
...I mean hold down so he wouldn't
turn over and flash me.

89
Okay, okay.

90
- Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
- Oh, yeah.

91
She's this really boring woman.
She's a teacher.

92
- A teacher?
- She's into history and foreign movies.

93
Oh, oh. And she loves puzzles. Huh?

94
Come on, who loves puzzles?

95
Well, Ross does.

96
You're ruining the plan!

97
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.

98
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Yeah.

99
- She even reads for pleasure!
- Ugh.

100
- How do you know a woman like that?
- I'm not allowed to know smart women?

101
- Joey?
- I met her at the library. I went in to pee.

102
- So now what do we do?
- Well, okay.

103
I'll call her and tell her the date's
canceled and find him somebody else.

104
What if we don't find him somebody
else? We'll just tell her the date's off...

105
...but we don't tell Ross. He goes
to the restaurant and gets stood up.

106
Ooh!

107
Ooh, I hear that's bad.

108
Ooh, so this is great. Rachel's
gonna have a terrible date...

109
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll
realize how good they have it together.

110
Ah, yes, the plan.

111
Ho-ho-ho.

112
It's not Santa's plan.

113
No, it's:

114
- Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
- No, I think we killed it.

115
Emma? Emma, look at me.

116
Well, I think I'll go downstairs
for a while.

117
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay. I didn't go.

118
Don't cry, it's just a bit.

119
I'm your Uncle Chandler.
Funny is all I have!

120
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be
ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

121
So don't touch yourself
for the next 48 hours.

122
I don't do that.

123
I'll try to stop.

124
- Wait, did you say until the 6th?
- Yeah.

125
Today is the 6th.

126
No, it's not. Look.

127
Yes, it's also 2003.

128
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

129
I may be done ovulating!

130
I may have also served some very
questionable meat at the restaurant.

131
- Go take the test, see if we're okay.
- Okay.

132
Tough crib.

133
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.

134
I might have checked to see
if I was ovulating a couple times.

135
Chandler.

136
I am not working! There's not much
to do around here!

137
Excuse me. Um... Heh.

138
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?

139
Um, someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

140
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.

141
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.

142
Um, can I get you another glass of wine?

143
I don't know if I should.
I don't wanna be drunk when I...

144
...go home alone tonight.

145
- Got stood up, huh?
- Eh, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.

146
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?

147
No!

148
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

149
Oh, good, because as of 4:00
this afternoon, I am not.

150
So let's do this.

151
- I don't think I can.
- Oh, come on.

152
I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.

153
- Because of Emma.
- Oh, my God, Emma.

154
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.

155
Oh, you're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.

156
Sorry.

157
Unless...

158
...maybe we do it here.

159
I mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?

160
Well, she's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...

161
...canoodling in it.

162
- "Canoodling"?
- Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw"...

163
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

164
I don't know,
I guess having sex in front of a baby...

165
...isn't so...
- Horrifying? Scarring?

166
Something people go to jail for?

167
- I guess you're right.
- You guess?

168
At that bed-and-breakfast,
we didn't have sex...

169
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.

170
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?

171
Wow, everything looks so good.

172
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.

173
I just have to say this.

174
- You're really beautiful.
- Oh. Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

175
I'm kind of funny-looking.

176
- What?
- Look, I mean, come on...

177
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.

178
I bet that guy over there
is probably saying:

179
"Ooh, why's she out with him?
He must be rich."

180
Well, I'm not.

181
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.

182
I'm not funny, either.

183
So if you were thinking,
"Well, he's not that good-looking...

184
...but maybe we'll have some laughs,"
that ain't gonna happen.

185
Well, come on, Steve, let's not rule out
nervous laughter. Ha-ha-ha.

186
Hey, now, wait a minute,
Phoebe told me...

187
...that you owned
your own restaurant. That's impressive.

188
I lost it to drugs.

189
I silk-screen T-shirts now.

190
Really? What's that like?

191
It's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.

192
That's right. I have no money,
I'm not funny...

193
...I live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.

194
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.

195
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

196
There must be something
that you like about yourself.

197
I do like my hair.

198
Really?

199
- Hello?
- Phoebe, it's me!

200
I'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

201
Hey, Rach.

202
This is the worst date ever! How could
you set me up with this creep?

203
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.

204
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

205
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.

206
- He's not stoned.
- Did he go out for a cigarette?

207
- Yeah. Four times.
- My dear, sweet Rach.

208
Oh.

209
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...

210
...and Ross is just stood up somewhere
at a restaurant all alone.

211
Great. Pretty soon
they'll be back together.

212
By the time anyone's figured out what
we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

213
Oh, wait, that's the end
of a different plan.

214
Oh, she's asleep. Chandler?

215
- What are you doing?
- Emma was doing it.

216
She's asleep.

217
Ooh!

218
- She's asleep. That means we can...
- Yes. But we have to be fast.

219
Oh, okay, I'll try.

220
- And you can't make any noise.
- Okay, I'll try.

221
Hello?

222
Emma?

223
Hey! Hi!

224
How are you? How are you?

225
Where are your babysitters, huh?

226
Why is the bedroom door closed?

227
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.

228
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.

229
Eh, if it was meant to be,
it's meant to be.

230
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

231
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.

232
In fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.

233
Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.

234
Although I was hoping
to have sex tonight. Heh.

235
Ooh.

236
Just the crab cakes.

237
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.

238
- Just get out of here, okay?
- I'm sorry, what's going on?

239
Uh, okay, um, the waiters have
a little pool going.

240
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.

241
What?

242
You're making money off my misery?

243
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

244
This is unbelievable. I have never
been so insulted in my life.

245
Now, if you'll wrap up my free
crab cakes, I'll be on my way.

246
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.

247
I think we may have done it this time.

248
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.

249
You may wanna get
some more of those too.

250
Where's Emma?

251
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?

252
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.

253
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel
came home early and picked up Emma.

254
You go look across the hall,
I'll call her cell.

255
- Okay.
- You better hope we're pregnant...

256
...because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

257
I can't believe I'm crying
in front of you.

258
You must think I'm so pathetic.

259
No, no, no, I admire a man
who can cry.

260
- Really?
- Don't touch my coat!

261
Oh. Sorry, that's my phone.

262
- Hello?
- Hey, Rach, how's it going?

263
Oh, my God,
this is the worst date ever.

264
Oh, come on.

265
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did
you really think that this was going well?

266
- What's up?
- Hey, did you stop by here?

267
- No.
- Oh, my God! Then...

268
Oh, thank God! Emma, there you are!

269
What? What do you mean,
"there you are"? Where was she?

270
Uh, we were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when I'm dramatic. Heh.

271
- Why the hell did you take her?
- Because you two were having sex!

272
- No, we weren't.
- Don't you lie to me.

273
I can tell by Chandler's hair. You are
so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

274
All right. All right, we were.

275
We were trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.

276
It is unacceptable that you'd
have sex with Emma in the next room.

277
- I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
- No, please don't. She will kill us.

278
Hey, I gotta. Unless...

279
Unless what?

280
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.

281
- What? Why?
- Hey, I may never have kids...

282
...and somebody's gotta
carry on my family name.

283
Your family name is Tribbiani.

284
Oh, ha, ha. You almost had me.

285
- Well, um...
- Look...

286
...I think I know the answer
to this question, but...

287
...would you like to make love to me?

288
Really, really not.

289
Ah, it's just as well.

290
It doesn't work anyway.

291
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.

292
- Hey, what's wrong?
- I just had a rough night.

293
Oh. Crab cake?

294
Ugh.

295
- Well, what happened?
- Uh...

296
Well, I... It's kind of weird
to talk to you about this, but...

297
Monica told me you had a blind date.

298
Yeah.

299
- I did too.
- Oh.

300
Uh, but is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?

301
Oh.

302
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,
saw you and left?

303
Why does everyone keep saying that?

304
If it makes you feel any better,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.

305
- That bad?
- Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

306
...and he thought it would be
appropriate to give me...

307
...this.

308
"Female Body Inspector"?

309
- What size is that?
- Ugh.

310
Now wait a minute.

311
- So they'll name their first child Joey?
- Uh-huh.

312
How do I get them to name
the next one after me?

313
It's easy. You just
walk in on them having sex.

314
Oh, so they owe me,
like, three Phoebes.

315
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

316
The plan is working!

317
Don't do the plan laugh.

318
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.

319
Oh.

320
Huh. You know, it is weird...

321
...that Phoebe would set me up
on a date that was awful...

322
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.

323
Wait a minute.

324
You don't think it was intentional?

325
I mean, that's just stupid.

326
We're geniuses. Huh?

327
- Look at them! They're really bonding.
- They're falling in love all over again.

328
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

329
Oh, they figured it out.
They're coming. Run!

330
- Where?
- Mexico!

331
Can you believe they're still not here?

332
I know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.

333
What are the chances?

334
I know, I'm so bummed.

335
Could we have
our free crab cakes now?

336
- What?
- We've been stood up.

337
And we want our free crab cakes.

338
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.

339
Although we do have a pool going
to see how long it takes that guy to cry.

340
I have such fat hands!

﻿1
Guys! Guys! I've got great news.
Guess what.

2
- Uh, Monica's pregnant!
- Really?

3
Let's get past the moment.

4
- What's your news?
- Thank you.

5
I got a job in advertising.

6
- Oh, honey, that's incredible!
- Wow.

7
Gosh, what's the pay like?

8
Oh, come on, people.

9
If I don't know who makes the most...

10
...how do I know who
I like the most? Hi, Joey.

11
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

12
We have interns at Days of our Lives.

13
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.

14
So, uh, what do you think
they'll have you do there?

15
It's a training program,
but they hire the people they like.

16
- That's great!
- There's gonna be some grunt work...

17
...which will stink. A grown man
getting people coffee is humiliating.

18
Humiliating and noble.

19
Thank you.

20
You know, if I didn't already
have a job...

21
...I would've been good in advertising.

22
Ross, you did not come up with
"got milk?"

23
Yes, I did! I did!

24
I should've written it down.

25
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him
good luck on his first day.

27
And I smelled bacon. Ha, ha.

28
- He just left.
- Who did?

29
Joey, you're never gonna
believe it! She called!

30
- She did'?
- You got it!

31
- I did?
- What is she talking about?

32
I don't know, but it sounds great!

33
No, your agent called.
You got that audition!

34
- With Leonard Hayes?
- Yes!

35
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a play on Broadway.

36
And in a real theater. Not that little one
underneath the deli like last time.

37
- Is it a good play'?
- It must be.

38
I read it and didn't
understand a single word!

39
- Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
- Yeah, and directing.

40
Oh, he was so good
in that movie of Macbeth.

41
- You saw that?
- No, but I saw the previews.

42
- They played it right before Jackass.
- Ah.

43
Oh, yeah, yeah. He has.

44
- He's done some amazing work.
- Oh, yeah.

45
Oh, I loved him
in those phone commercials.

46
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone. Ha-ha-ha.

47
Maybe the monkey
will be at the audition.

48
Don't make me more nervous
than I already am!

49
- Good morning.
- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

50
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,
just like you guys.

51
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.

52
Seriously, you're an intern?

53
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

54
Dude.

55
I know I'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.

56
The comedian. USO.

57
Uh, it's U.S.A., sir.

58
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

59
And as you probably already know,
this is Leonard Hayes.

60
Wow.

61
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.

62
Well, I've been blessed with
a lot of great roles.

63
Tell me about it, huh?
"Unlimited nights and weekends!"

64
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.

65
I didn't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!

66
I almost lost a cousin
because of bad wireless service.

67
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
you were great in those commercials.

68
- Really?
- Yeah.

69
Well, I do bring a certain
credibility to the role.

70
- It's true.
- Are you kidding?

71
When they shoot
you out of that cannon...

72
"Hang up that phone!"

73
- One take.
- Wow.

74
Did that in one. I know.

75
- So shall we read?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

76
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

77
Mm-hm.

78
What the hell are you still doing here?

79
Oh. Uh.

80
- I think you know.
- Bastard!

81
I am what you made me.
You know what? I could go right now.

82
- Go! Go!
- I can't.

83
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

84
...but I can't.

85
I'm so sorry. You're not supposed
to say "long pause."

86
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your
character's name. You know?

87
I thought you were, like, an Indian
or something, you know, with the...

88
- Sorry.
- Long Pause.

89
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

90
Sure you don't want me to do it again?

91
- I could do it with an accent.
- No.

92
You know, Southern.

93
"I could go right now, mon!"

94
Huh?

95
My God in heaven.

96
Joey, hang on for a second. Leonard,
can we talk to you for a moment?

97
Yes?

98
You've gotta be kidding.
See, he can't act.

99
I don't care if you think he's hot.

100
If you wanna sleep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a play.

101
No, listen, if you insist on this...

102
...I will call my agent so fast...

103
...on a cell phone connection so clear,
he's gonna think I'm next door!

104
Uh, hi. Uh, thank you so much
for whispering for my benefit.

105
If you tell me what I did wrong, I would
love to work on it and try it again for you.

106
And also, how you doing?

107
Would you please just give me another
chance? I really wanna get better. Please?

108
Really?

109
Well, if you wanna come back today...

110
- ...here are my notes. Ready?
- Yeah.

111
Um, you're in your head.
You're thinking way too much.

112
I really doubt that.

113
No, no, no. It's that you're not connected
with anything in your body.

114
- No urgency. The scene is a struggle.
- Uh-huh.

115
- It's a race.
- Uh-huh.

116
Also, what you did was horizontal.

117
- Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
- Uh-huh.

118
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.

119
Couldn't I just sleep with
the producer?

120
Hey, do you wanna go
to dinner tonight?

121
Oh, I can't. I've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

122
Yeah, I know we've only gone out,
like, twice, but I don't know...

123
- ...I have a good feeling about her.
- Oh, I hear divorce bells.

124
Give me your wallets,
and there won't be a problem.

125
- What?
- I have a gun.

126
Okay, just relax, Phoebe.
Just stay calm.

127
Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!

128
- All right, lady, now give me your purse.
- No.

129
What do you mean, "no"? I knew
you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

130
- Lowell, is that you?
- Phoebe?

131
- Oh, my God!
- Unbelievable! Oh, my God! Oh!

132
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,
Lowell, from the streets! Ha, ha.

133
- Lowell, Ross.
- Ross, nice to meet you.

134
Yeah, a real pleasure.

135
- Oh, it's been so long! Oh, so long.
- Ha-ha-ha.

136
- I can't believe you're still doing this.
- Ah, I know. But I quit smoking.

137
Good for you.

138
You look like you're doing well.

139
I guess your mugging days
are behind you.

140
Oh.

141
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?

142
Excuse me, Ross,
old friends catching up.

143
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

144
- How'd the audition go?
- They wanna see me again, but, uh...

145
...boy, Leonard Hayes did not like me.

146
- What happened?
- Oh, he said I wasn't urgent enough.

147
Everything I did was horizontal,
and I should be more vertical.

148
- Oh, and he said that I should think less.
- Well, so far so good.

149
Honey, I'm old!

150
What's wrong?

151
I am so much older than these other
interns. I can't compete with them.

152
So you're a little older.

153
Look at the positive.
You have all this life experience.

154
Yes, but I don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.

155
Wow! It's like they're on fire!

156
Ooh.

157
- What are they?
- Prototype sneakers.

158
I need ideas on how to sell them.
Which I can't do...

159
...because no self-respecting adult
would ever wear these.

160
I'll give you $500 for them.

161
- What am I supposed to do?
- Come on, sneakers are easy.

162
- You wear them all the time.
- They're not called sneakers anymore.

163
They're called "kicks" or "skids."
I think I heard somebody say "slorps."

164
They've got wheels that pop out from
the bottom so you can roll around...

165
...because apparently
walking is too much exercise.

166
"Kids! Kids! Roll your way
to childhood obesity!"

167
Would you help me try to sell these?

168
Okay. Have you considered
using a girl with huge knockers?

169
That's not what they're looking for.

170
Hey, that would work on me.

171
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butten/vorth's?

172
- Hey.
- Hey.

173
- Hey.
- You'll never guess what just happened.

174
- Phoebe and I got mugged!
- Are you okay?

175
Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger.

176
How do you know a mugger?

177
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.

178
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.

179
Seriously?

180
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

181
...when I was living on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff...

182
- That is awful.
- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

183
I didn't eat gold
and have a flying pony.

184
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

185
- Your mother killed herself.
- She was a drug dealer.

186
It was a good thing Phoebe knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.

187
Okay.

188
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

189
- Why?
- Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.

190
- You were?
- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

191
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

192
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of trouble Spider-Man got into.

193
Ahem, Wonder Woman. Ahem.

194
Anyway, I was heading
towards this bakery...

195
...to pick up a couple of dozen
linzer tortes for someone...

196
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

197
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God.

198
I know. And the worst part was
they took my backpack...

199
...which had all the original artwork I had
done for my own comic book, Science Boy.

200
Oh, yeah! What was
his superpower again?

201
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.

202
I better get to class.

203
Are there any more of your friends
I should look out for on my way?

204
No. Actually, you might wanna
stay away from Jane Street.

205
That's where Stabby Joe works.

206
- Okay, I think we have a problem here.
- What?

207
Well, um, back in my mugging days,
I, um, worked St. Mark's Comics.

208
- Yeah?
- Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice...

209
...and, um, preteen comic-book nerds
were my meat.

210
So?

211
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

212
"Geology rocks!"

213
- Oh, my God!
- I know! I mugged Ross!

214
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

215
But can I just run to the bathroom?

216
- No. Leonard doesn't wait.
- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

217
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.

218
- I really need...
- We must go now, quickly.

219
- Yeah. Yes, sir. Ahh.
- Ready?

220
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know!

221
- Oh, you sick bastard!
- I am what you made me! Know what?

222
- What?
- I could go right now.

223
- Then go. Go!
- Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

224
Cut. That was good!

225
- Very good. You did everything I asked.
- I did?

226
Yes. Plus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quality...

227
...you bring to the character
I couldn't have imagined.

228
Wow, hey, here's what we're gonna do:

229
Come back tomorrow
for the final callbacks.

230
Do all of this, what you got going now.
But you know what?

231
More. More. Can you do that?

232
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I really gotta go!

233
Look at that! Still in character.
I like him.

234
I plant seeds. I can't explain it.
I don't know.

235
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Hey. Putting on the sneakers...

236
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

237
- Oh, anything yet?
- Yes, how's this?

238
"They're so uncomfortable, it's like
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."

239
- Hey.
- Hey.

240
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing. Ha, ha.

241
No, that seems about right.

242
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.

243
I got a callback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

244
Mm-hm.
- ...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

245
- Joey, that was formula.
- We gotta get more of that.

246
These aren't half bad. You should
suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

247
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

248
All right. I feel younger already.

249
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

250
- Hey, you!
- Hey.

251
Hey. How was class?

252
No one ever asks me that.
What's wrong?

253
- Nothing. I really wanna know.
- Oh, uh.

254
Well, there was actually a rather
lively discussion about the Pleistocene...

255
All right, nothing is worth this.

256
Um, I have a confession to make. Um...

257
Okay, you know that, um, girl that
mugged you when you were a kid?

258
What are you talking about?
It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.

259
You don't have to lie anymore.
I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

260
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

261
No, it wasn't. You don't think I would have
defended myself against a 14-year-old...?

262
- "Give me your money, punk!"
- Oh, my God, it was you!

263
I can't believe it. You mugged me?

264
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.

265
But, you know, if you think about it,
it's kind of neat.

266
I mean, well, it's just that I've
always felt kind of like an outsider.

267
You know, the rest of you have
these connections that go way back...

268
...and, you know, now you and I
have a great one.

269
It's not the best!

270
I know. Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

271
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiliating thing ever.

272
- Really? Even more humiliating than...
- Let's not do this!

273
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...

274
...and start making out
with each other. Huh? Huh? Huh?

275
That's interesting.

276
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.

277
- Who's next? Chandler.
- Okay.

278
You start on the image of
a guy putting on the shoes.

279
- He's about my age.
- Pfft! Your age?

280
Uh-huh.

281
So he's rolling down the street
and he starts to lose control.

282
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.

283
Just then, a kid comes flying by
wearing the shoes.

284
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:

285
"Not suitable for adults."

286
- Well, Chandler, that's great.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

287
Or, man who's two years
younger than me.

288
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.

289
- How did you come up with that?
- I don't know! I don't know!

290
I was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to flow.

291
- That is great. Good work.
- Thank you.

292
We'll see all of you tomorrow.

293
The cold weather hurts my hip.

294
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at
me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?

295
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

296
I just really wanted to apologize again.

297
And also show you something
I think you'll find very exciting.

298
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"

299
Look, Ross. In this box...

300
...are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell...

301
...or smoke.

302
Anyway, I was looking through it,
and I found...

303
...Science Boy.

304
Oh, my God!

305
- I never thought I'd see this again.
- Yeah.

306
What...?

307
It's all here!

308
- Yeah.
- Ha, ha.

309
What made you save it
all these years?

310
I guess I just thought
it was really good.

311
And maybe it would be
worth something one day.

312
You really thought Science Boy
was worth saving?

313
Yeah. But you should know I also have
a jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.

314
Still, this is amazing!

315
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

316
You're welcome. And thank you for
Science Boy. I learned a lot from him.

317
You're welcome.

318
- I need an answer!
- I can't tell you something I don't know.

319
- You know!
- I don't know!

320
- I need an answer now!
- You want an answer? The answer is...

321
Aw...

322
She never loved me.
She only loved you.

323
You knew this all along
and you never told me?

324
I can never forgive you, or myself. I have
nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

325
Absolutely amazing.

326
- The part is yours.
- Thanks! Now I really got to get going.

327
Wait, wait, wait! Congratulations.
You did it.

328
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.

329
Wow! That's a big cable bill.

330
Ha. You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.

331
On a Saturday afternoon?

332
I was in the house!

333
Hey, uh, Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that...

334
She was the huge guy
that mugged you? Yeah.

335
I see. You didn't happen to tell...

336
- Everybody we know? Yeah.
- Great. Thanks.

﻿1
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

2
I know. God, I haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

3
...since I was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

4
- What happened to all of our money?
- Well, I'm not sure exactly what they did...

5
...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

6
Well,
I guess with you doing the internship...

7
...we're just spending more
than we're bringing in.

8
Yeah, maybe I should quit
and get a job that pays.

9
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

10
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

11
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was, you know, finding gold.

12
You know what? I think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

13
Okay? So we pay our bills late
this month.

14
Maybe next month,
we cut back on a few things.

15
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

16
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

17
All right. Worst-case scenario is,
we borrow some money from my parents.

18
No, we're not borrowing money.

19
- Why not?
- Because we don't do that. We are Bings.

20
If there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

21
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

22
But the other thing was,
never borrow money.

23
Wow, I had no idea
you had this much pride.

24
That's right, I do. I am your man.

25
And I'm gonna get us
through this situation...

26
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

27
- I'm gonna go.
- Why?

28
I haven't been home in a couple days
and I need to get more clothes.

29
You don't have to go.
I have something that'll fit you.

30
I put that tube top on as a joke.

31
- I want you to stay.
- I want to stay too.

32
But I've got as much use
out of these boxers as I can.

33
- Why don't you turn them inside...
- Done it.

34
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right. I'll miss you.

35
Me too.

36
You know what? I just realized
something. I don't want to go home.

37
- Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
- No, no, what I mean is...

38
- ...I hate going back to my apartment now.
- Mm-hm.

39
Partly because I live above
a known crack den...

40
...but, you know, mostly because
when I'm there, I really miss you.

41
So...

42
...do you want to move in together?

43
Wow, Mike Hannigan...

44
...you sure know how to
make a girl say "Hell, yeah."

45
- So we're doing it?
- Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

46
Wow.
We're really gonna move in together?

47
Yeah.

48
I've always wanted to live with a guy.

49
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

50
No, we are not having sex anymore.

51
It's gonna be fun.

52
- Hey, JOEY-
- Hey.

53
Listen, I need to know
that what I'm about to ask you...

54
...will never get back to Chandler.

55
I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't thought about it myself.

56
But Chandler is my best friend.
It would be wrong.

57
Good, but wrong.

58
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

59
But that's not what I'm here to talk
to you about. I need to borrow money.

60
Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know...

61
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

62
- But Chandler lent you money.
- And he would tell you it was a mistake.

63
Come on, I just... I need it
for some rent and some other bills.

64
Oh, well... Well, how much?

65
- Two thousand dollars?
- Two thousand dollars?

66
What do you think I am,
a soap-opera star?

67
- Yeah.
- That's right, I am.

68
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

69
- What's in the bag?
- You know how Emma started crawling?

70
I realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

71
...so I went to the store and I got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

72
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

73
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

74
"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."

75
Or, "Whoops,
Joey electrocuted himself again."

76
Anyway, um, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

77
- No, I was just gonna do it myself.
- Ha, ha.

78
- You're gonna do it'?
- Yeah. Why?

79
- You don't think a woman can do this?
- Women can. You can't.

80
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

81
- You're a pig. And you can't do this.
- What?

82
What? Come on, I found
the hardware store all by myself.

83
The hardware store's
right down the street.

84
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

85
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

86
- Phoebe and I are moving in together.
- Congratulations.

87
I know, it's so exciting. You know,
I've never lived with a guy before.

88
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

89
Unless they're playing
"This ls What My Sister Would Look Like."

90
Yeah, she's not so cute.

91
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Well, you put down the toilet seat.

92
Yes, dear.

93
- Is that a bit you guys do?
- Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

94
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

95
Yes, dear.

96
I can't believe you're moving in together.
That's gre... I'm happy for you guys.

97
- I hear wedding bells.
- Monica, slow down, okay?

98
I'm just excited to be living with him.

99
You know, I mean, I don't know...

100
...can I see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

101
You know, I could picture myself
walking down the aisle...

102
...in a wedding dress that highlights
my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.

103
But do I want that house in Connecticut,
you know, near the good schools...

104
...where Mike and I could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

105
Oh, my God, I do.

106
Phoebe, I had no idea
you were so conventional.

107
I know. I guess I am.

108
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
I want to be a soccer mom.

109
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, you bet, roomie.

110
Don't you mean "groomie"?

111
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

112
These guys.
We haven't even moved in yet...

113
...and they have us picking out
china patterns.

114
China patterns!

115
This is easy. "Can't do this..."

116
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

117
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

118
Listen, um, I need to ask you a favor,
and we can't tell Monica anything about it.

119
- I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
- That will remain the official party line.

120
Look, Monica and I are having
a little financial trouble.

121
- Yeah, I know.
- What? What do you mean, you "know"?

122
Uh...

123
I just figured it out, you know?

124
I mean, you're not working
and, uh, the economy is bad.

125
Oh, right.

126
That is the fastest I have ever thought.

127
Anyway, uh...

128
...I need to borrow some money.

129
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

130
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

131
Uh, well, I know how much
you used to make...

132
...and I know how much your rent is.

133
Oh, okay.

134
I am on fire.

135
Listen, this is really nice.

136
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

137
Did Monica borrow money from you?

138
- Uh, kind of.
- I can't believe her.

139
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

140
No, no, no. It wasn't because
of your money problems.

141
It was for something for her.

142
What?

143
Something personal.

144
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

145
Excuse me.

146
Boob job.

147
I don't want her to get a boob job.
That's crazy.

148
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

149
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

150
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you
about Monica's little "groomie" joke.

151
Well, I think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word "roomie."

152
No...

153
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

154
No, the thing I want to say is...

155
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

156
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

157
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.
- Okay.

158
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

159
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

160
- What do you mean?
- Look, Phoebe, I...

161
I love you very much.
But I never want to get married again.

162
Oh.

163
- Wow.
- It's just, my first marriage was...

164
...you know, such a disaster that
I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

165
- Mm-hm. Was it really that bad?
- At one point, near the end...

166
- ...she deliberately defecated on my...
- Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

167
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

168
...a blond who always uses the toilet?

169
Except for once in the ocean.

170
Look, it's not about who I would marry.

171
I was certain the first time I got married
it would last forever. I was wrong.

172
- But, it just...
- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

173
I just never want to get married again.

174
- Ah.
- I'm sorry.

175
Are you okay with that? If not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

176
No. Oh, I definitely don't
want to get married.

177
No, I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

178
Because, you know, if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

179
...there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.

180
- Trust me. I will never...
- Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

181
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

182
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
I can barely use chopsticks.

183
- You're all set.
- Oh, thank you so much.

184
Wait. You forgot your, um...

185
Your game.

186
Thank you.

187
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

188
Don't look at me. I never get his jokes.

189
- Thank you?
- No, no. Don't thank me.

190
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing that I would change about you?

191
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

192
...two single things.

193
Okay, you're being weird.
Do you want sex...

194
...or did you do something bad?

195
No. No. No. I just love
the way you look. I am warm...

196
...for your form.

197
Okay, um, you know the old classics like,
you know, "You look nice"?

198
They're still okay.

199
But "you look nice" could mean
that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."

200
I want to compliment your body.

201
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

202
And more specifically, I wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

203
- Okay.
- I mean...

204
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

205
Don't answer that.

206
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

207
I know. Why do you think he was
so worried about me getting bigger?

208
I don't know.
I mean, what brought that on'?

209
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You know what?
We're trying to get pregnant...

210
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

211
- You think that's what it is?
- You heard him.

212
"No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger."

213
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

214
- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
- Yeah. If you don't, I will.

215
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

216
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

217
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

218
God, it's just such a magical time.

219
- Hi.
- Hey.

220
Listen, I wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

221
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

222
I mean, I can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home...

223
No, I really want to know
how you feel about it.

224
- Why?
- Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

225
- Never?
- Never.

226
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

227
I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

228
You know, that I won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

229
Yeah, marriage stinks.

230
I mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

231
...get them married.

232
- That's not how you really feel, is it?
- No, I'm sorry.

233
Look, I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't help it.

234
I love marriage.

235
Seriously, you? Divorce-0?

236
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer
"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.

237
Look, look, I know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

238
...but, you know, I loved being
that committed to another person.

239
And Carol and I had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

240
And once afterward.

241
Anyway, I'm sorry.

242
Ugh. It's okay. That's how you feel.

243
But, come on, I mean,
living together will be great.

244
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

245
- I do love Mike.
- Yeah, see?

246
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

247
...and you know what? You should be.
It's a big deal.

248
Yeah, I guess you're right.

249
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

250
The Divorcer to the rescue.

251
- It's not cooler.
- Yeah, I just heard it.

252
Oh.

253
Rash?

254
Rachel?

255
So I can't do anything I like?

256
Hey, Rach.

257
Ah, perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

258
- Honey?
- Yeah?

259
About that.

260
- Um, I'm going to change.
- Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

261
I'm gonna get bigger.

262
Honey, I...

263
I love your breasts the way they are.

264
Ugh. Fascist.

265
Well, my breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

266
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

267
Your ass?

268
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

269
- They do that?
- It's kind of a package deal.

270
God, why? Why would you
want to do that to yourself?

271
I thought it was something
that we both wanted.

272
If it means that much to you, I may be
able to get on board with the big boobs...

273
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

274
Oh, my God, Chandler.

275
If you can't handle this,
what are you gonna be like in the hospital...

276
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

277
What?

278
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

279
Because she is.

280
- Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
- Mm-hm. For your boob job.

281
- Joe...
- It's over.

282
Okay, so I'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

283
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

284
- Better.
- Yeah?

285
Very cool.

286
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

287
- ...and I hope I was a little helpful.
- Oh, yeah, you were helpful.

288
- Yeah. No, thank you.
- Good. Good.

289
Because the more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

290
...I don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

291
What do you mean?

292
I know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

293
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

294
...but is that really you? I mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

295
They are awfully boxy.

296
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. I mean, it's so normal.

297
Uh-huh. Yeah.

298
Hey, can I help?

299
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

300
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

301
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

302
Hey, where do you guys want this?

303
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

304
I mean, not for me, because I'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

305
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

306
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

307
Right.

308
Except that I do want to get married.

309
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

310
What? You want to get married?

311
Someday.

312
And hernia.

313
I haven't had a normal life. And I never
felt like I was missing out on anything.

314
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

315
If you wanted to get married,
why didn't you say something before?

316
Because I didn't know
how much I wanted it.

317
And I love you,
and I wanted to live with you.

318
I wanna live with you too.
I mean, let's do that.

319
But I don't think I can.

320
It was okay to move in when
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

321
But I can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

322
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

323
Are you gonna change yours?

324
No.

325
Me neither.

326
Um, I think I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

327
But I don't want this to end.

328
No, I don't want it to end either.

329
I can't believe this is gonna end.

330
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

331
Yeah. Okay.

332
Okay, so, uh...

333
Good bye.

334
- Take it easy, Mike.
- Bye, Mike. See you later, Mike.

335
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

336
We're all sorry.

337
Look on the bright side.

338
I mean, at least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

339
That was here already, huh?

340
I love you.

341
I did it! I did it! Ha, ha!

342
All right.

343
I'd better take all I can carry.

344
Who knows when I'll be able
to get in here again, huh?

﻿1
- You ready to go?
- Let me just finish this.

2
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

3
Yeah, I can't do that. Heh.

4
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen this?

5
It's our new alumni website for college.

6
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.

7
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.

8
It's actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.

9
Remember Andrea Rich?

10
- Tall girl, wouldn't sleep with you?
- Uh-huh.

11
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

12
Bet she'd sleep with you now.

13
No, I already e-mailed her.

14
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.

15
- Oh.
- "Doctor of paleontology, two kids."

16
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?

17
I think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.

18
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later,
okay? Let me just grab my coat.

19
Okay.

20
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?

21
Maybe we finish this for him.

22
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

23
She is now my girlfriend.

24
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.

25
- And send.
- No, no... You can't do that to him.

26
- All right, let's go.
- Dude!

27
Uh, I think you made it clear you can't be
trusted with the ball inside the house.

28
And send.

29
Hey. How was basketball?

30
It was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.

31
Oh, no. Who did that?

32
Chandler. Yeah.

33
H93'-

34
- Rash?
- Yeah?

35
What's Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

36
She was just crawling around
and she found him...

37
...so I just let her sleep with him.

38
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Of course. Yeah.

39
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.

40
I know that.

41
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you love him.

42
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.

43
I like him a normal amount.

44
All right. Well, Emma loves him.

45
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?
He's a wonderful person.

46
- Hi.
- Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

47
- You feeling better?
- Breaking up sucks.

48
- Oh, I really miss Mike.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

49
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...

50
...but I can't think of anything
that rhymes with:

51
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your help getting through this.

52
You're saying you're
not gonna need my help?

53
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...

54
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

55
Oh, good, because I've already thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth.

56
Okay. I mean,
I know I did the right thing.

57
Mike never wants to get married...

58
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship
that has no future.

59
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...

60
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

61
Okay, you got it.

62
Unless...
Am I being too crazy about this?

63
All right, so, you know,
there's no future.

64
But that doesn't mean
we still can't have fun.

65
- You know what? Forget what I said.
- Really?

66
- All right, if that's what you want.
- That was a test, and you just failed.

67
Damn it! Rookie mistake.

68
I have sex with dinosaurs?

69
I believe I read that somewhere.

70
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible. Okay?

71
Depending on the species, I'd have
to have a 6-foot-long... It's not funny!

72
I respectfully disagree.

73
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.

74
- Who cares? Nobody reads those.
- You better hope not...

75
...because I just read what
you put on your page.

76
- I don't have a page.
- Oh, I respectfully disagree!

77
Look at you. All sweet
and innocent, sleeping like an angel.

78
With Emma's chubby little hands
wrapped around you.

79
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

80
Step away from the crib!
I have a weapon!

81
It's okay! It's okay, Rach!
It's me! Put down the scrunchie.

82
- What are you doing?
- Well, I heard Emma stirring...

83
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.

84
Oh. Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

85
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

86
This isn't over.

87
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...

88
...that you are
"as gay as the day is long"?

89
Because I told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.

90
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

91
Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

92
Hello?

93
No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife.

94
Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too.

95
Well, I guess I should've known. Yeah.

96
He just kept making me watch
Moulin Rouge.

97
Hang up-Hang UP-

98
And that was a great movie.

99
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

100
Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.

101
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you'll see, my friend!

102
I'm dead?

103
And so young.

104
Posting that I died?
That really isn't funny.

105
Well, how you died was funny.

106
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

107
It kills over one Americans every year.

108
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think I'm dead.

109
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls.

110
You're messing
with people's feelings here.

111
You wanna talk about people's feelings?

112
You should have heard how hurt
Professor Stern was...

113
...when I told him I wouldn't be able
to go with him to Key West!

114
You've really crossed a line here.
But that's okay.

115
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

116
...and a stack of gay porn.

117
That's right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

118
God, I wish Mike were here.

119
Okay, if Mike were here,
what would the two of you be doing?

120
What are you, animals?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

121
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There's no harm in that.

122
Phoebe, that's how it starts.

123
"I don't need to eat the cake,
I'll just smell the icing.

124
Why not just a little sliver?"
Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."

125
You know, the next thing you know,
you're 210 pounds...

126
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide.

127
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

128
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.

129
And if you see him, you're gonna
wanna get back together.

130
And I know that's not what you want.

131
All right, so give me your phone.

132
- Here.
- Thank you.

133
- And now your cell.
- Okay.

134
There you go.

135
- This is your cell phone?
- Yes.

136
This is your current cell phone?

137
Yes.
It reminds me of a simpler time.

138
Phoebe? Where's your purse?

139
“Hey! No!
- No!

140
- Give it to me!
- You can't have it.

141
- Give it to me!
- No.

142
- I'll go in there.
- Oh, yeah.

143
- Come here!
- No!

144
- Give it to me!
- You're crazy! God.

145
Aha!

146
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!

147
Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

148
Joey, Emma's right here.

149
You promised not to bring girls home
in the middle of the day anymore.

150
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...

151
- ...a brand-new Huggsy!
- Oh.

152
Oh, that's so great.
Now Emma has two Huggsies.

153
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

154
The new Huggsy. Huh?

155
The other Huggsy, I don't know,
I guess I'll just take him back.

156
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

157
Oh, I loved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I would braid her tail...

158
Make the transfer!

159
Should I be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

160
Don't worry about it.
I swallowed that years ago. Hey.

161
Oh, what? I don't think
she likes the new Huggsy.

162
- But he's the same.
- I think she wants the old one back.

163
- Yeah, but he's the same.
- Joey, come on.

164
But he's the same.

165
You're not the same.

166
Aha!

167
You know, it's a lot
less surprising to do that...

168
...after I've buzzed you into the building.

169
So, Phoebe, why are there
men's shoes by the door?

170
- Those are my shoes.
- Oh.

171
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

172
Look, Monica, I really appreciate
you checking in on me.

173
- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
- You are?

174
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be alone right now.

175
- Who's that?
- I ordered Chinese food.

176
What are the chances?

177
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!

178
- What are you doing here?
- Phoebe called me.

179
- Phoebe!
- I'm sorry. I broke down.

180
I wanted to see him.

181
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?

182
There's a speakerphone
on the base unit.

183
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

184
- Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she...
- This doesn't concern you.

185
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

186
Look, guys, you can't do this.

187
It's gonna make getting
over each other harder.

188
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?

189
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I'll join you.

190
I'm your friend and Mike's friend.

191
Well...

192
Sit down.

193
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Make room for your friend.

194
- So how have you been?
- I've been pretty good.

195
- You look really beautiful.
- Thanks. You look good too.

196
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.

197
So how's the piano playing going?

198
Actually, I've been playing a lot
of love songs lately.

199
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

200
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

201
And then a pigeon ate it.

202
Hey. Ross.

203
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

204
Don't tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.

205
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Check this out.

206
So that's what I'd look like
if I worked out.

207
And was being serviced by a policeman.

208
You're not gonna actually
send these out, are you?

209
Actually, I don't need to, because your
little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.

210
Okay? There were no responses.

211
Nobody posted anything on the website,
nobody called my parents...

212
...so the joke, my friend, is on you.

213
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.

214
Oh, my God.

215
- Nobody cares that I'm dead?
- Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

216
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...

217
...just for coming out of the closet.

218
I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!

219
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.

220
I can't believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And I carried that guy.

221
All right.
Look, let's think about this, okay?

222
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?

223
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?

224
This isn't about people
not caring that you're dead.

225
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.

226
- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
- Right.

227
Come on. I'm sure if you had a funeral
or memorial service...

228
...tons of people would come.

229
Exactly!

230
Ross, what are you doing?

231
You're having a memorial service
for yourself?

232
No, that would be stupid.
You're having it for me.

233
- Ross, don't press send. Don't press...
- No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

234
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.

235
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

236
Uh, original or crappy?

237
- Original.
- No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

238
Then what's that big lump
under your covers'?

239
- It's Monica, okay?
- That's not Monica!

240
All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!

241
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.

242
She's being unreasonable.

243
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!

244
Oh, don't cover its ears!

245
It's because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.

246
- It does?
- Yeah.

247
And she's comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

248
- Really? She loves me?
- Oh, yeah.

249
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

250
Emma will totally understand.
I won't, but whatever.

251
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if...

252
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then...

253
Well, she can have him.

254
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey
would step up.

255
- Look, Emma. Look who's back.
- No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

256
Are you...? You're gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?

257
How do you think I got him
in the first place?

258
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

259
I don't want anything going
on while I'm gone.

260
Here's a few things you can discuss:

261
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

262
I've missed you so much.

263
I'm not gonna ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but...

264
- Just to be with you one more night.
- I want that too.

265
- But is that gonna make it too hard?
- It can't be any harder than this.

266
I mean, if I had known the last time
I saw you would be the last time, I...

267
I would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

268
Everything about you.

269
If I had known the last time I kissed
you would be the last time...

270
...I never would have stopped.

271
Kiss him, you fool!

272
- What?
- Didn't you hear that speech?

273
If you don't kiss him, then I will.

274
I missed you so much.

275
- I knew you'd be here!
- Aw, crap.

276
- Who is this?
- It's my friend Manny.

277
I asked him to keep me away from you.

278
- Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
- Well, you're not doing a very good job.

279
- Excuse me?
- What's with the kissing?

280
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.

281
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.

282
- You didn't hear the speech.
- I've heard the speech.

283
If he knew it was gonna
be the last time...

284
Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!

285
- You're weak!
- You're weird!

286
- Your pants are undone.
- Oh!

287
Where'd they go?

288
- Damn it.
- Well, we blew it.

289
I blame myself.

290
And I blame you too.

291
It's been an hour, and not one
of my classmates has shown up?

292
I tell you, when I actually die, some
people are gonna get seriously haunted.

293
There you go. Someone came.

294
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

295
This is so exciting. My first mourner!

296
Hi. Glad you could come.

297
- Please come in.
- Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

298
- I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
- Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

299
Thanks. Uh, I'm so sorry
about Ross, it's...

300
No, at least he died doing what he loved.

301
Watching blimps.

302
- Who is it?
- You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

303
I don't remember him.

304
But then again, I touched so many lives.

305
So did you know Ross well?

306
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.

307
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

308
- Yes, he is. Me.
- What? You mean...? Oh.

309
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close'?

310
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.

311
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

312
- Hey, listen. Call me.
- Okay.

313
- I'm dead and no one cares?
- I look like a man?

314
Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.

315
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.

316
You gave them one day's notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

317
And Monica, it's probably
the way you stand!

318
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.

319
I mean, I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?

320
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.

321
I mean, it's 15 years later
and we're still best friends.

322
Doesn't that count for something?

323
Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.

324
I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.

325
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's
memorial service.

326
- Kori? Kori Weston?
- Yeah.

327
- You look amazing.
- And you are?

328
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

329
You are married, though.

330
Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

331
I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

332
I didn't know Ross and you
were so close.

333
Oh, we weren't. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.

334
And he talked so passionately
about science.

335
- I always remembered him.
- I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

336
And if heaven has a door...

337
...I'm sure he's pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

338
I thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.

339
I guess I really missed my chance.

340
No, you didn't!

341
I'm still alive!

342
Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

343
It's a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.

344
The fact that you're here
means more to me...

345
...than if this room were filled
with people.

346
You sick freak! Who does that?

347
I can't believe I had a crush on you.

348
Did you hear that?

349
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

350
No, Mom, I am not dead.

351
I know it's not something to kid about.

352
It was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?

353
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.

354
Monica?

﻿1
Monica?
Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?

2
- Okay.
- All right!

3
But, uh, ahem, what is it not?

4
A place to entertain my lady friends.

5
- And what else is it not?
- A place to eat spaghetti.

6
- Very good.
- Thanks.

7
- What do you need it for anyway?
- The, uh, lottery is up to 300 million...

8
- ...and they don't sell tickets here.
- So you're driving up to Connecticut?

9
Yeah, Connecticut.
Not West Virginia.

10
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.

11
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,
we could really use $300 million.

12
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."

13
- Will you get me tickets too?
- Yeah, me too.

14
- Sure.
- Ooh! I have an idea.

15
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,
we'll pool our money together...

16
- ...and then if we win, we'll split it.
- That's a great idea!

17
No, thanks.

18
- You don't want to win the lottery?
- Uh, sure I do.

19
I also want to be king
of my own country...

20
...and find out what happened
to Amelia Earhart.

21
- Still on Amelia Earhart?
- The woman just vanished!

22
Seriously, you don't want in on this?

23
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the lottery?

24
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by lightning 42 times.

25
But there's six of us, so we'd
only have to get struck 7 times.

26
I like those odds!

27
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.

28
I mean, that's such a bunch
of boo-hockey.

29
I'll ask.

30
"Boo-hockey"?

31
Oh, we think Emma's about
to start talking...

32
...so we're trying to be careful about
what words we use in front of her.

33
So get ready to hear a lot
of, uh, boo-hockey...

34
...gosh darn it
and brother pucker.

35
How do you know
she's gonna start talking?

36
When I talk to her, I almost feel
like she understands what I'm saying.

37
Kind of like Joey.

38
What's that now?

39
God, look at all these tickets.
It's so exciting.

40
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.

41
Pie-eating contest?

42
You assume because I was heavy that's
the only way I could win something?

43
No, I saw a picture
of you covered in blueberries.

44
- That was a good day.
- Yeah.

45
- They're towing your car!
- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.

46
They're towing a car.

47
And I am seeing spots.

48
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!

49
- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
- Joey, relax.

50
My mother picked her up two hours ago.
You were there.

51
- I was?
- Yes, and you talked to her.

52
- I did?
- She dropped off a casserole.

53
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.

54
Did you come by to watch
us win the big bucks?

55
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...

56
...and see a night rainbow
with gremlins dancing on top of it.

57
Don't touch the phone!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

58
- You think he washed his hands?
- Hello?

59
- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
- What's going on?

60
Chandler's supposed to find out if he's
getting a job at his agency.

61
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.

62
- Ooh. Tough odds.
- Yeah.

63
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.

64
Yeah, look who's coming around!

65
Damn it. All right, call me
when you know more.

66
- Did you get it?
- One of the slots got filled.

67
- By you?
- Sense the tone.

68
- No, that kid Nate got it.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

69
- I mean, come on, pull up your pants!
- I know.

70
Well, there's two spots left, right?

71
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I want to get one.

72
I want my friend Charlie
to get one.

73
Except I don't care about Charlie.

74
Hey!

75
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic...

76
...and she said I was definitely
gonna win the lottery tonight!

77
I thought we could use
some extra luck...

78
...so I brought a wishbone home
from work.

79
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.

80
- All right, who wants to do it?
- Ooh, can I?

81
Vegetarians never get
to do the wishbone.

82
It's really not fair.
Just because we don't eat the meat...

83
...doesn't mean we don't like
to play with the carcasses.

84
All right. Rash'?

85
I don't want that turkey smell
all over my hands.

86
I'll do it! It'll get the casserole
stink off of mine.

87
- I hope I win.
- Well, it doesn't really matter.

88
You're both wishing
for the same thing.

89
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for, or else,
you know, it won't come true. Ha, ha.

90
Right. But we know
what you're wishing for.

91
- I can't really say.
- I understand.

92
But you're wishing
for what we think, aren't you?

93
I'm not really comfortable
with these questions!

94
- Please!
- Just do it!

95
Okay. One, two, three.

96
I won! Hey!

97
You know what? I'm sure your
wish is gonna come true.

98
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie will come out if we rub this lamp.

99
Qw!

100
That thing gets hot!

101
Ross, just keep making yourjokes.

102
How are you gonna feel
if we actually do win?

103
- Uh, you're not gonna win.
- I know the odds are against us...

104
...but somebody has to win, and it could
be us. And then how you gonna feel?

105
We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's
take our helicopters up to the Cape."

106
And you're gonna be all,
like, "Oh, I can't, guys.

107
I'll have to meet you up there.
I gotta gas up the Hyundai."

108
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.

109
I can see the headline now:
"Lottery Winners' Friend...

110
...Filled With Regret,
Eats Own Arm."

111
Why would I eat my own arm?

112
Well, you wouldn't, but we own the
paper. We can print whatever we want.

113
You know what? I'm gonna
throw in 50 bucks for you.

114
- Why?
- Because I know that you think...

115
...that the lottery is boo-hockey...

116
...but we're all here, and we're gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.

117
And you're my brother,
and I want you to be a part of this.

118
You don't have to do that.
I mean, I'll pay for myself.

119
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.

120
Come here.

121
Get a room.

122
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?

123
- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
- Ooh. Calm down.

124
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?

125
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?
I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."

126
Oh! Oh! I know! We should pool all
our money and buy the Knicks!

127
I don't really care about the Knicks.

128
You will when I pick you
as starting forward.

129
You would do that?
I never get picked!

130
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.

131
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.

132
You're right, it has been your dream
for over 15 seconds.

133
Uh, how long until they announce
the numbers, Mommy?

134
I'll take this one too. Uh, "Mommy"?

135
Oh, I've gotten into the habit
of calling Rachel "Mommy"...

136
...when we're around Emma.

137
Which I now realize we are not.

138
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough...

139
- ...it'll be her first word.
- Oh.

140
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me "Daddy" too.

141
Mm. I like that, Daddy.

142
I, uh... I was just talking about Rachel.

143
Ooh, is Daddy getting angry?

144
Is Daddy gonna spank me?

145
Well, that depends.

146
Have you been a bad...? No, I can't.

147
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.
Did anybody else hear?

148
What? Susan got it? How?

149
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!

150
All right, bye.

151
Dude, I'm sorry.
But hey, there's one spot left, right?

152
- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
- Hey, don't say that.

153
You've got just as good a chance
of getting that job.

154
He is the boss' son.

155
- Come on, lottery!
- Yeah!

156
- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
- Okay, here we go.

157
We need to sort through the tickets
quickly to see if we've won.

158
So does anybody have any ideas
how to organize this?

159
Okay, how about this:

160
We divide them
into six groups of 40.

161
The remaining 10 can be read
by whoever finishes first.

162
- I have another idea.
- I'm sorry, idea time is over.

163
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
- Yeah.

164
- What about the ones on the nightstand?
- There are no tickets there.

165
Yes, there are.
I just saw them a few minutes ago.

166
Heh. Uh, no, you didn't.
You must be mistaken.

167
- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
- Chandler, sense the tone.

168
Well, well, well.
Look what Mommy found.

169
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra
tickets for me and Chandler.

170
The psychic also said
that I would be betrayed.

171
I can't believe this.
I thought we were all in this together.

172
- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
- Three minutes ago!

173
I don't know why that's important.

174
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?

175
When you were reading the dirty
magazines without taking off the plastic.

176
I'll show you how.

177
Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one
of your special tickets wins?

178
How are you gonna feel when you win
and lose your friends?

179
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.

180
Someone gave me muffins last week.
I couldn't get rid of you for three days!

181
Chandler, would you just tell her
what she did was wrong?

182
She's right. You shouldn't have
bought tickets just for us.

183
Let me finish.

184
However, it doesn't look like
I'm gonna get this job...

185
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!

186
There's the man I married.

187
All right. Believe me,
if you win the lottery...

188
...it's the last you're gonna hear from us.

189
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.

190
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic
surgery so they look just like you!

191
You know what?
I want my share of the tickets.

192
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!

193
And Steffi Graf! Ha, ha.

194
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...

195
...I'm gonna put it all
into a very low-yield bond!

196
No. You guys, we gotta keep
all the tickets together.

197
No. No, we should divide them up...

198
...and I should get extra because
we used my car!

199
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!

200
- This whole thing was my idea!
- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!

201
Just give them to me,
and I'll split them up!

202
Aw!
- Ah!

203
ROSSI Hey, hey!
- Aah!

204
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!

205
- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
- Wait, no, no! Hey!

206
If we're not doing this together,
we're not doing it at all.

207
- Say goodbye to your tickets.
- No! No! No!

208
Do not come any closer!

209
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.

210
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?

211
- Fflends!
- Money!

212
Fflends.

213
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?

214
They're all in there.

215
- Even these five that I hid in my bra.
- Monica!

216
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.

217
There is no way I was
gonna dump this...

218
- Aah!

219
I think I broke your bowl.

220
Go! Go! Go!

221
What a beautiful night to be running
around the street, looking for tickets.

222
And the wind sure made it fun.

223
- Phoebe, we lost half of them.
- So what?

224
Monica, we have the winning ticket.

225
My psychic said I was
gonna win, remember?

226
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.

227
As a matter of fact, she said
that's how I'm going to die.

228
So excuse me
for being a little skittish.

229
There's two messages.
This could be from work.

230
- Oh, play them.
- Okay. Here we go.

231
Hello. This is the pigeon
from the balcony calling to apologize.

232
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
out of the pretty lady's hand.

233
It was all my fault.
Not hers. Bye. Coo.

234
Well, I bet that was very hard
for him to do.

235
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.

236
This is it. Shh, Shh!

237
Listen, um, it turns out I got the last spot.

238
I'm really sorry, man.
It was a lot of fun working with you

239
Give me a call if you want.

240
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.

241
Sorry, Chandler.

242
It is so unfair. It's like that time they
promoted Saundra over me at work.

243
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?

244
No, she was just much better
at her job than me.

245
You guys, the drawing's about to start.

246
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...

247
- ...before she goes down.
- Good idea.

248
Honey, you're being really strong
about this.

249
I know how badly you wanted that job.

250
Yeah, you know,
I really thought I deserved it.

251
But let's go win the lottery. I mean,
we still have a 130 chances to win, right?

252
Hundred and thirty-one.

253
Yeah, good night, sweetheart.
I love you.

254
And remember,
you're Daddy's little girl. Heh.

255
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.

256
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.

257
Rach, they're announcing the numbers!

258
My God, I can already feel
myself changing.

259
Here are your official Powerball
numbers. We have 53.

260
- I've got that.
- We have one too!

261
We are on the road, people!

262
Come on!

263
Mom, please, I know you love your new
lips, but I can barely understand you.

264
Would you please just let me
say good night to my daughter?

265
And here we go.
The Powerball is seven.

266
All right, check your numbers!
Make me rich.

267
You guys,
you're not gonna believe this.

268
I was just saying good night
to Emma, and she said her first words.

269
- What?
- Well, what did she say?

270
She said, "Gleba"!

271
Make me rich!

272
- Isn't that amazing?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.

273
Why aren't you more excited?

274
Rach, heh, "gleba" is not a word.

275
- Well, of course it is.
- Okay. What does it mean?

276
Well, I don't know all the words.

277
You know, I'm just glad I didn't
miss my daughter's first word.

278
- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
- Okay. Use it in a sentence.

279
Okay. Uh, Emma just said, "Gleba

280
- It's not a word.
- Ugh. Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.

281
Oh, okay, great.

282
While you're at it, she said another word
the other day. Why don't you look up:

283
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba
Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!

284
Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing
inner mass of a certain fungi."

285
Heh.

286
She's gonna be a scientist.

287
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?
- No.

288
I'm still looking through mine.

289
Just double-checking. No.

290
No. No.

291
No!

292
Hello? Hold on.

293
It's your boss.

294
Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you"
phone call.

295
I'm not used to getting these
from guys.

296
- Hey, Steve.
- Chandler, hi.

297
I'm sure you've heard
we filled the three positions.

298
We felt that with your
maturity and experience...

299
...you wouldn't be happy
being someone's assistant.

300
I'd love to be somebody's
assistant. Answering phones...

301
...getting coffee,
I live for that stuff.

302
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!

303
Chandler, you were the strongest
person in the program.

304
We're offering you the position
of junior copywriter.

305
Me? That guy
who just said, "butt cracks"?

306
Yes, that's right.

307
We're excited about the level
of sophistication...

308
...you'll be bringing to the job.

309
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

310
What?

311
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna
be a junior copywriter!

312
Congratulations!
Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.

313
Thanks. Does that mean
I get the good loving tonight?

314
You bet. No TV or anything.

315
- Hey, that is so great about the job.
- Thanks, man.

316
I'd like to think I had
something to do with it.

317
- Really? Why?
- Well, before with the wishbone.

318
I, uh, didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.

319
Oh, yeah?

320
Don't tell Monica.
She'll rip your heart out.

321
Oh, yeah.

322
Well, you know what?
There was a little part of me...

323
...that really thought we were gonna win.

324
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.

325
You guys? What was the Powerball
number again?

326
- Seven.
- We won.

327
- What?
- We won!

328
- Let me see! Let me see!
- Don't tear it!

329
Phoebe, you don't have any
of the first five numbers!

330
I know that, but look, we got
the Powerball number. We won $3!

331
Wow, you think we should get that over
20 years or go for the big payout?

332
I don't care. I've never won
anything before. I can't believe this!

333
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do
with your $3?

334
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.

335
Aw. You know what?
You can have mine.

336
- Me too.
- Me too.

337
Me too. Ha, ha.

338
Well, I guess if everybody else is.

339
Hey, guys. So I just called
the Powerball hot line.

340
- Can you believe it? Nobody won.
- Um, I beg to differ.

341
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...

342
...and he found a ticket on the street
right outside and won $10,000.

343
Coo. Again, don't blame the pretty lady.

344
It was not her fault.
It was me, the pigeon. Coo.

345
Seriously, stop staring at her.

﻿1
God, you're beautiful.

2
Why are we fighting this?

3
You know you want it to happen
as much as I do.

4
I want you. I need you.

5
Let me make love to you.

6
I don't wanna stand in the way
of, uh, true love or anything...

7
...but I think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

8
No, I'm, uh, rehearsing my lines.

9
They're giving me a romantic story
on Days of our Lives.

10
It's the first time my character's got one.
I'm nervous. I want it to be good.

11
Wow, I haven't seen you this worked-up
since you did that dog-food commercial...

12
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

13
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

14
Ooh, hey, you wanna, uh, come down
to the set and tell me if I'm doing okay?

15
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

16
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

17
- That was an honest mistake.
- Right.

18
"Oh, my God. Is this the men's room?
I feel so foolish.

19
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?"

20
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

21
- Hey!
- Hey.

22
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

23
- Sure!
- I'd love to.

24
Well, you can't.

25
- We're booked solid for the next month.
- Well, I can't give you a massage...

26
...because my license
has been revoked again.

27
- Phoebe, what happened?
- Well, it was an accident, you know.

28
It's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

29
Have I got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

30
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

31
What? No, I'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

32
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

33
- So can you get out of work?
- Honey, I can't.

34
- Things are crazy at the restaurant.
- You're really that busy?

35
Yeah. I'm sorry, I really am.

36
That's okay.
I'll just, uh, try and reschedule.

37
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
I made a reservation there...

38
...and I need to change it.

39
What do you mean it's nonrefundable?
Well, can I just come some other time?

40
Can't you make an exception?

41
Tell them I'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

42
Tell them that in two weeks, I will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

43
Look, this is ridiculous.
I'm not paying for that room, okay?

44
Well, thank you very much.

45
Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.

46
- Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
- I don't have travel insurance.

47
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

48
Why don't you take Ross?

49
Heh. Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

50
- No, not if the room has two beds.
- I guess.

51
It still seems a little...
"Moonlight boat ride"?

52
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

53
I don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

54
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

55
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, I'm...

56
Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

57
And also, so gay.

58
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

59
Well, at the Christmas party,
him and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

60
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

61
- Oh. Ahem.
- Okay. All right, wish me luck.

62
Okay. Not that you need it, but good...
God! Is that Chase Lassiter?

63
- He's straight, right?
- Rash, if you weren't here wondering...

64
...if these guys were gay,
I don't know if I could do this.

65
- I'm sorry, you're right. I'm sorry. Good luck.
- On a bell, please.

66
Quietly.

67
And action!

68
Drake, what are you doing here?

69
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

70
...and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

71
- Get out.
- You don't love him.

72
What do you know about love?

73
I know what I felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

74
- That kiss never happened.
- Well, what about this one?

75
Now, I told you to get out.

76
Fine, I'll go.

77
But let me ask you one question.

78
- You look real familiar. Have we...?
- Shh! He's asking her a question.

79
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

80
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

81
Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because I...

82
Because I can't stop loving you.

83
- Don't say that.
- Tell me to stop.

84
Just"

85
...tell me to stop.

86
- Cut!
- No!

87
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

88
- Everything was delicious.
- Thank you.

89
It was. The duck in particular
was superb.

90
Thank you.

91
You haven't said anything.

92
Actually, I do have one small complaint.

93
Oh, well, please, I welcome criticism.

94
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

95
What musician?

96
And there's a country called Argentina

97
It's a place I've never seen

98
But I'm told for 50 pesos
You can buy a human spleen

99
Human spleen

100
Olé!

101
What are you doing here?

102
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so I'm here to entertain.

103
- Great.
- Yeah, it really has been great too.

104
They must have seen me
play before...

105
...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

106
Yeah, "You Suck"...

107
...and, um, "Shut Up and Go Home."

108
- Listen, Phoebe.
- Yeah.

109
You know how much
I love listening to your music...

110
- ...but...
- But what?

111
Um, this is kind of a classy place.

112
Okay, say no more.

113
It wasn't just that she was fat
The woman smelled like garbage

114
Everyone!

115
It wasn't just that she was fat
The woman smelled like garbage

116
Classy, huh?

117
Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.

118
Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.
Where are you joining us from?

119
- New York.
- The Big Apple.

120
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

121
I ate all my gifts for everybody.

122
I'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

123
- That's impossible. Check again, please.
- Check again, please.

124
- I'm sorry, it's not here.
- It's not there.

125
Let me get this straight.
I called to try to cancel my reservation...

126
...was told it's not refundable.
We drove six hours all the way up here...

127
- ...and now we don't have a reservation?
- I don't know what to say.

128
She doesn't know what to say.

129
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

130
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

131
- That's insane.
- It's totally insane.

132
Let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

133
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

134
Does that room have a closet
I can lock him in?

135
- We'll take it.
- Great.

136
- They are totally ripping us off!
- Dude, don't worry about it.

137
I know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

138
We just load up on those.
Like those apples. Instead of taking one...

139
...um, I take six.

140
Great. At $100 an apple, we're there.

141
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

142
- Dude, you're shaking.
- It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

143
- Hi.
- Hey.

144
Joey, I got to tell you, I have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

145
- You were amazing.
- Oh.

146
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

147
And my costar's good.

148
But they're not as good as me!

149
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

150
I'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

151
Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.

152
- I can ask Monica.
- Screw her! That part is mine!

153
Right.

154
Okay, so, uh, just from the top
of the page right here.

155
Okay.

156
Hello, Drake.
I'm surprised to see you here.

157
- I can't believe you married him.
- Well, what choice did I have?

158
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

159
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

160
It's over. You have to accept that.

161
How can I, knowing I'll never
hold you in my arms again...

162
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

163
...knowing I'll never make love to you?

164
How can I accept
that I can never kiss you again...

165
...when it's all I can do not
to kiss you right now?

166
Kiss me.

167
What?

168
Kiss me.

169
- Uh, Rach, it doesn't say that.
- No, I'm saying it.

170
- But...
- Just don't talk.

171
Well, that's new.

172
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

173
Um, I've forgotten a couple of things.

174
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

175
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

176
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.

177
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

178
Um, is there anything else you have
that I haven't asked for already?

179
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

180
- What'd you get?
- USA Today.

181
Nice. Put it with the others.

182
And I also got two more apples.

183
We're four short of a bushel!

184
God, I feel so alive.
I love being in the country!

185
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

186
- ...from the restaurant.
- That's not cool.

187
Dude, none of this is cool.

188
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

189
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

190
For example: a hair dryer, no, no, no.

191
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes, yes.

192
Now, the salt shaker is off limits. Ah.

193
But the salt...

194
I wish I'd thought this through.

195
I think I get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

196
...but the bulbs...
Oh, you already got that.

197
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

198
- Okay, uh, how about this?
- No, no, no.

199
- You can't take the remote control.
- Yes, but the batteries.

200
Thank you. Thank you very much.

201
- Ooh! Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
- No!

202
At least tell me where you hid it.

203
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

204
Have you ever had any...

205
...weird, romantic dreams?

206
Hmm, let me think.

207
Oh. When I was younger, I used to dream
that I got married to Mayor McCheese.

208
And on our wedding night,
I ate his head.

209
Okay.

210
Well, this is like that...

211
...in no way.

212
I had a dream last night
that I wanted to kiss Joey.

213
Wow! You mean like
"kiss him" kiss him?

214
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it was pretty intense.

215
- What brought that on?
- I don't know.

216
Maybe it had to do with the fact
I saw him do a love scene.

217
- A love scene? With who?
- Olivia.

218
Olivia?
I thought she was marrying Connor?

219
Oh, right. Real life more important.

220
- You think my dream means anything?
- I don't know.

221
I mean, you saw him do a love scene.
Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.

222
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

223
Huh...

224
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

225
Of course it was.
Trust me, when it comes to psychology...

226
...I know what I'm talking about.

227
- I took two psych classes in college.
- You took the same class twice.

228
- It was hard!
- I know.

229
- Hey.
- Hi.

230
Here, Monica, look what I got to wear
when I play at your restaurant.

231
Ah. Ah. Wait.

232
Right? I think this might even class up
"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."

233
Um, Phoebe...

234
...maybe I wasn't clear before.

235
I really love listening
to your music here.

236
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

237
Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

238
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

239
It's sort of your songs.

240
I just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

241
Oh. Okay. Fine, I'll just...

242
I'll take the hat back.

243
There.

244
Hey, so you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the...

245
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

246
Okay, we're still on that.

247
- I didn't say they weren't good enough.
- Then what's wrong with them?

248
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

249
- Tiny portions?
- Yeah, well, um, "Excuse me.

250
I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but I can't see it. I can't see it."

251
- Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
- Well, it's not about quality.

252
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

253
Have you ever heard of a "key"?
It's what some people sing in.

254
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

255
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

256
So that's what we're doing.

257
When I'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

258
- ...I'm wearing earplugs.
- Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

259
You know what?
I take back what I said before.

260
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

261
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

262
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

263
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

264
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

265
- I didn't factor in the room tax.
- Dude, don't worry about it.

266
I found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

267
- Oh, my God.
- What?

268
There's something new in the bowl.

269
- Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
- No, but I want the pine cones.

270
- There's a forest right outside.
- It's not the same.

271
Okay, go quick.

272
Thank you for a delightful stay.

273
MY maple candy!

274
The food here at Javu
Will kill you

275
The food here at Javu
Will kill you

276
It's just you. I thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

277
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

278
- Okay, you have to stop playing now.
- Why?

279
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

280
- Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
- Get your garlic peelers off me.

281
Excuse me? Excuse me?

282
Hi, I'm Monica Geller.
I'm the head chef here.

283
Okay, I was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

284
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

285
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

286
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

287
Ha!

288
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

289
...but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

290
Who identified this restaurant's tone
as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?

291
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

292
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

293
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

294
Excuse us.

295
All right, here's a question.

296
Uh, who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

297
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

298
...and feels really bad about it now?

299
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

300
...that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

301
...which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

302
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

303
Hey, you wanna stick around
and I'll whip you up some dinner?

304
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr...

305
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

306
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

307
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

308
Oh, man. I thought I got it all.

309
How...?

310
How?

311
I was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

312
I couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

313
And I thought, "Well, you know,
how important can that be?" Right?

314
Turns out, very.

315
Wow, definitely just Drake.

316
- What?
- How's it going with Drake?

317
- I don't think it's going very well.
- What?

318
That scene I saw was so good.

319
Well, I'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

320
Is this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?

321
A little.

322
No, I really am worried. I have to make it
convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.

323
- So?
- So I've never played that.

324
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
I mean, you've been in love before.

325
Uh, well, just once...

326
...with you.

327
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

328
I'm just gonna blow past it.

329
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

330
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

331
What the hell are you talking about?

332
All right, look, just, um, try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

333
...and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

334
Oh.

335
Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.

336
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

337
- Uh-huh.
- And Olivia and her husband are there...

338
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

339
That makes me think about those times
I wanted to grab you and kiss you...

340
...but you didn't know, so I would
just pretend everything was cool...

341
...but really it was killing me.

342
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

343
Well...

344
Hey, you know what else I could use?

345
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

346
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

347
I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

348
You know?

349
And I remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

350
...when I would think to myself,
"My God, she is beautiful."

351
And it hurt so much because I knew
I could never tell you.

352
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

353
Thanks, dude. This is great!

354
I got you something from Vermont.

355
Besides tampons and salt?

356
Oh, my God.

357
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

358
That's weird, it's empty.

359
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out, or...?

360
Do you guys hear a buzzing?

﻿1
You said you'd marry Joey?

2
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.

3
I would have said yes to anybody.

4
Like that time
when you and I got married.

5
I'm not helping.

6
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?

7
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.

8
But I am prepared to let that go.

9
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...

10
...you were engaged to my best friend?

11
Well...

12
Really?

13
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.

14
- Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
- Mm-hm.

15
- Joey's my... No! Uh-uh!
- Ah.

16
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

17
Rachel said she'd marry you?

18
This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

19
I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.

20
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.

21
- See? Huh?
- Mm.

22
So sexy.

23
- Honey?
- Yeah?

24
- Honey, why don't you lie down?
- It's okay.

25
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.

26
Am I producing them?

27
- Why are you so tired?
- I couldn't sleep last night.

28
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.

29
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.

30
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.

31
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."

32
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.

33
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

34
- Hi.
- Hey.

35
- Welcome home.
- Hi.

36
Phoebe did the signs.

37
Oh, you guys, thanks for doing this.

38
- Look at all that stuff people sent.
- Oh.

39
Oh! Ha, ha.

40
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.

41
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.

42
What are people think...?
Oh, you guys, I love it.

43
Hey, so, uh, where's Ross?

44
Uh, he's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.

45
- Uh, is he still mad at us?
- Well, you more than me.

46
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby. Ha, ha.

47
That's not fair. I can't do that.

48
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.

49
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.

50
Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

51
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.

52
But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.

53
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.

54
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...

55
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

56
Walter.

57
She's just so cute.

58
Oh, I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.

59
Mm-hm.

60
Phoebe. Ha, ha.

61
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.

62
- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
- Oh, great. The pacifiers?

63
- Uh, it's in the, uh, cupboard.
- The, uh, burping cloths?

64
- Uh, linen closet.
- The diapers?

65
In the hospital.

66
Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.

67
No, I, uh, left the diapers
at the hospital.

68
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.

69
All right, thanks. Oh, could you stop
at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?

70
- Oh, sure. What kind?
- Um, let me think.

71
What do I want?

72
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...

73
...say, I don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.

74
- Blueberry.
- Blueberry it is.

75
Thank you.

76
- Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
- Unh.

77
God, how long do you think
that's gonna last?

78
I don't know. He got over the
"We were on a break" thing quickly.

79
You know what,
I can't worry about it right now.

80
- Because I've got the cutie little baby.
- Hmm.

81
Oh. I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean, I can't get enough of her.

82
Like, right now? I miss her.
I actually miss her.

83
You know, that's her?

84
Oh, God, look at her sleeping.
Oh, I love her so much.

85
- I think I'm gonna wake her up. Ha, ha.
- Oh, Rach, no.

86
You know, you're never
supposed to wake a sleeping baby.

87
Well, I can do whatever I want.
I made her.

88
Come on, little girl.
Oh, yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.

89
Well, I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.

90
I'm sorry. Oh, Mommy's so sorry.
Go back to sleep. Shh, shh, shh.

91
Go back to sleep.

92
- Oh, it breaks your heart, doesn't it?
- Oh, it really does.

93
How long do you think
we have to stay?

94
Okay, if everyone's on board,
it's settled.

95
Chandler?

96
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

97
McKENNA:
Are you on board?

98
Yes.

99
Well, then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.

100
You're gonna love Oklahoma.

101
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her...

102
Oh, try this one. "Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe."

103
- All right, here's something.
- What?

104
It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

105
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

106
Okay.

107
It worked!

108
Oh. No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.

109
Oh.

110
Oh. Mon, what am I gonna do?

111
It's been hours,
and it won't stop crying.

112
- She, Rach. Not it. She.
- Yeah. I'm not so sure.

113
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- Yeah, no kidding.

114
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!

115
Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple
of blueberry muffins to go?

116
- Diapers, huh?
- Yep.

117
So I guess Rachel had your baby?

118
- Yep. Can you believe it?
- Nope.

119
I can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.

120
Huh?

121
Oh. Oh. You, ha, ha,
mean, like, uh...

122
Huh?

123
Hey.

124
I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.

125
Uh, actually, uh, we don't.

126
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,
I didn't even do anything wrong.

127
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

128
- I said I didn't technically.
- Okay.

129
Let's put aside the fact
that you "accidentally"...

130
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

131
Can I just stop you there
for a second?

132
When people do this:

133
I don't really know what that means.

134
You were saying?

135
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

136
But why couldn't you tell me, huh?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

137
I know. I should've.
"I'm sorry."

138
Not using it right, Joe.

139
Oh. "I'm sorry."

140
- I'm gonna go.
- No, come on.

141
- Ross, we have to get past this.
- Give me the bag.

142
No, I don't know what else to do.
I said I'm sorry, now...

143
Now you should scream at me
or curse me or hit me.

144
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.

145
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.

146
- No, I don't.
- A little bit.

147
- No.
- Little bit.

148
- No.
- A little bit more.

149
- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
- No, hit me. Hit me.

150
- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.
- Hit me.

151
- No.
- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!

152
- You ducked!
- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!

153
- Oh, my God! This really hurts!
- I couldn't help it.

154
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.

155
What is the matter with you?

156
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?

157
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.

158
Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.

159
Oops!

160
- Try feeding her again.
- I already fed her.

161
I know. That's why I said, "Again!"

162
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?

163
That's just what she wants.

164
- Hi.
- Hey.

165
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

166
Just stay here. I'm gonna check her
diaper. Pheebs, you wanna come?

167
Oh, I'm kind of part of this.

168
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.

169
I knew I should've married Chandler.

170
- Okay, what's up?
- Okay. Um, ahem.

171
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?

172
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...

173
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.

174
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

175
You know how people say
that Tulsa...

176
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?

177
What? Who says that?

178
People who have never been
to Paris?

179
- Well, what's going on?
- We're moving to Tulsa.

180
Oh.

181
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

182
Ms. McKenna, she kind of,
uh, works above my boss...

183
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.

184
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.

185
- Tulsa, Oklahoma?
- The Sooner State.

186
Whatever that is.

187
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.

188
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin"'?
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?

189
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?

190
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?

191
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.

192
- I'll get out of it.
- Thank you.

193
- What is wrong with Emma?
- Oh, she misunderstood.

194
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

195
Ma'am, uh, do you have a minute?

196
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

197
- What?
- Uh, it's a funny story, actually.

198
Ha, ha. Ahem.

199
Um, I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.

200
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.

201
You fell asleep?

202
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.

203
Isn't that funny?

204
Irony. Not a fan? All right.

205
See, here's the thing.

206
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.

207
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.

208
Please don't make me go there.

209
- Chandler, I...
- No, no, no.

210
Look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?

211
Why would I
when your name is Elaine?

212
Sorry. Oh!

213
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.

214
That's a picture of your daughter,
isn't it?

215
Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

216
I'll call you from Tulsa.

217
Hey. So, uh, how is it?

218
- I broke my thumb.
- Your thumb?

219
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?

220
Make a fist.

221
Maybe later.

222
Ross, I feel terrible.

223
You know what, you can go.
I just have to, uh, fill out some forms.

224
You, uh, want me to help you with that?

225
Why, does it look like I'm having
trouble with my misshapen claw?

226
Name?

227
No, I know Ross.
But what's it short for?

228
You know, like Rossell.

229
Or, uh...

230
Or Rosstrophor.

231
Just Ross.

232
Oh.

233
It's pretty.

234
- Okay, date of birth?
- You know my birthday.

235
Sure.

236
May... tember?

237
- October 18.
- Occupation? Dinosaurs.

238
Actually, I'm a paleon...
Dinosaurs is fine.

239
The drawing is not.

240
All right. Uh, who do you want
as your emergency contact?

241
- Uh, Rachel, I guess.
- Okay. Relationship?

242
Ooh, boy, this could take a while.

243
Just, uh...

244
- Just put roommate.
- Come on.

245
You guys are more than that.

246
- You're gonna get together, right?
- Ahem.

247
I don't think that we are.

248
But you two are supposed
to be together.

249
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.

250
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.

251
She'd just had the baby. She was
all freaked out about doing it alone.

252
- She would have said yes to anybody.
- Yeah, that's what she said.

253
- So?
- So I don't want to be just anybody.

254
- Wow.
- You know what?

255
It's better this way anyway.

256
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.

257
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.

258
- Really?
- Yeah.

259
- And you're okay with that?
- Yes. That's what we always planned.

260
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.

261
That's why they call them plans.
Hello? Ha, ha.

262
I'm fine.

263
Hey, for what it's worth...

264
...with Rachel, I don't think
you'll ever be just "anybody."

265
Hey, there you go.

266
"Thanks."

267
Oh, my God.
How long has she been crying?

268
- About a week and a half.
- Oh.

269
Well, it looks like you guys got it
under control, so I'm just gonna go.

270
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?

271
All right.

272
- Try holding her a different way.
- Look, I'm doing the best I can.

273
- Anyone else is welcome to try.
- All right, I'll try. Fine.

274
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay, here you go.

275
- Okay.
- Oh, gosh.

276
Shh.

277
Nothing works with this child!

278
Oh, God, what am I gonna do, you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.

279
- I'm the worst mother ever.
- No, you're just new at this.

280
You'll get better. Think about
your first day at work.

281
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.

282
Yeah, I don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!

283
- Oh, God, just please take her.
- Okay, I'll take her. Come here.

284
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

285
- Okay.
- I have to go scream into a pillow.

286
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.

287
Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.

288
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

289
Have I gone deaf?

290
It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

291
You must be a fireball in bed!

292
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.

293
Oh.

294
I have actual magical powers.

295
I can hear traffic and birds.

296
I can hear the voices in my head
again.

297
I'm kidding.

298
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!

299
Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.

300
- You are the official baby-crier stopper.
- Yes, I am.

301
- Oh. You're never leaving the apartment.
- Say what?

302
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, I need you here.

303
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.

304
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
See you later. Ha, ha.

305
Rachel?
Let's give it six to eight months.

306
Oh.

307
Okay, so listen,
I'm gonna go lay down.

308
What?

309
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.

310
So...

311
Thank you.

312
- Hey.
- Shh.

313
- We just got her to go to sleep.
- Oh, so there can't be any yelling?

314
No.

315
We're moving to Tulsa.

316
- What?!
- Shh. Shh.

317
- Chandler...
- Shh.

318
Shh!

319
I can't... I can't hear.

320
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

321
- What happened to you?
- Uh, I had a little thing with Joey.

322
If you think this is bad,
you should see him. Ha, ha.

323
Oh. No, Ross, this is not good.

324
We have to talk about this Joey thing.
Please sit.

325
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.

326
Okay? I never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?

327
Okay.

328
You know what I really, really want?

329
What, Rach?

330
I wanna sleep.

331
I wanna eat.
I wanna take a shower.

332
I mean, before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.

333
- Right.
- I mean, because I got news for you.

334
Emma: Not easy.

335
- Well, that's what I'm here for.
- Mm-hm.

336
- You want me to get that?
- No, that's really okay.

337
- Monica?
- Got it, got it, got it, got it.

338
Uh, I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.

339
- It's a natural instinct.
- What are you talking about?

340
Okay, what would you do if I did this?

﻿1
Hey, you guys? What are
you doing tomorrow night?

2
Oh, well, let me see.
I believe I'm...

3
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.

4
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.

5
I could fall asleep at a play.

6
- What is it?
- It's a one-woman play called:

7
Why Don '2' You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.

8
Ooh.

9
- That sounds interesting.
- That does sound interesting.

10
To listen to a woman complain for
two hours. I don't think it gets bet...

11
I know! I know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.

12
What more do these broads want?

13
Well, you guys will have a great time.
I promise.

14
What? How come you don't have to go?

15
I wish I could, but I found out...

16
...that I have to be at work really
early the next day, so I can't go.

17
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.

18
Ooh. Let's see. Who do I hate?

19
Oh, sorry.

20
- Oops, sorry.
- Okay.

21
- Okay.
- Okay. Up you 90-

22
- Oh, gosh, okay!
- All right.

23
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

24
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...

25
...and not have it be a big deal?

26
No, I don't think that ever works.
Why?

27
- No reason.
- No, no. Rachel?

28
- Yeah.
- Who do you want to fool around with?

29
Nobody! Forget it.

30
Joey?

31
Maybe.

32
- You can't.
- Why?

33
Because.

34
Okay, seriously,
did not understand a word you just said.

35
- In the hall.
- Okay.

36
- You wanna fool around with Joey?
- Yeah.

37
Ever since I had that dream about him,
I can't get it out of my head.

38
I mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.

39
Who do you know that are friends
that just fool around?

40
Okay. Off the top of my head...
Don and Janet.

41
- Who are they?
- I know them from work.

42
- Both of them?
- No, just one of them.

43
Which one?

44
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?

45
No, Rachel, things could get
incredibly complicated.

46
You're right. I won't do anything
with Joey. I just thought it...

47
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
a pound of baking soda and a red onion?

48
What the hell are you cooking?

49
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
You guys won't believe
what I have to do for work today.

51
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.

52
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...

53
...and I have to meet them here
and show them around campus.

54
What's bad about that?

55
I just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...

56
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.

57
Ross?

58
What? These aren't suede.

59
Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.

60
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?

61
No.

62
Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.

63
- Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.
- Oh.

64
Oh, that's... That's...
That's nice.

65
It's good to meet you.

66
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.

67
No, it's no big deal.

68
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.

69
Is he gonna introduce us?

70
I think we're just blurry shapes
to him now.

71
By the way,
I really enjoyed your paper...

72
...on the connection between geographic
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.

73
I wrote that in one night.

74
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.

75
Well, we should probably get going.

76
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

77
Isn't another professor
supposed to come with us?

78
I don't think so.

79
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?

80
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:

81
If you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.

82
An option that many of my students use.

83
- Shall we?
- We shouldn't wait for him?

84
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'll find us, okay?

85
- Professor Geller?
- Oh, damn it!

86
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

87
Listen, I forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.

88
- Hey!
- Hey!

89
What's happening?

90
It's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.

91
I'd love to, but I gotta get up
so early the next day.

92
- You know me, work comes first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

93
Hi, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.

94
Stupid Jan Rogers!

95
You are having a party tonight?

96
I'm kind of having a thing
for the Days of our Lives people.

97
You weren't gonna tell us?

98
How did you think
you'd get away with that?

99
I do it every year.

100
You do that every year?!

101
I didn't have to tell you that!

102
God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!

103
That's why you got us tickets
to that play, to get rid of us!

104
Yeah.

105
Last year is that why you sent us
to that Medieval Times restaurant?

106
Yeah.

107
The year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?

108
I can't believe you guys went
for that one.

109
Why wouldn't you invite us
to your parties?

110
You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.

111
Well, then, so just invite me.

112
Please, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.

113
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. I will behave. I promise.

114
- I will behave. Please, please, please.
- Okay, fine. You can come.

115
But don't tell anybody else.
It's up on the roof at 8.

116
A soap-opera roof party?!

117
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Uh, my God! Oh, my God!

118
And it's out of my system.

119
And then my wife and I went
on a cruise to the Galépagos.

120
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.

121
There were clams and mussels
and oysters...

122
...and cracked crab...

123
...and snow crab...

124
...and king crab.

125
It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.

126
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?

127
- And that's not all I'm allergic to.
- Oh, it's not over.

128
I'm also allergic to peanuts
and cashews...

129
...and almonds and filberts...

130
So basically all nuts!

131
Interestingly, no.

132
You're kind of playing it fast and loose
with the word "interesting."

133
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.

134
Oh, my God!

135
I've lost the will to live.

136
- Let's ditch him.
- What?

137
While he's still in the bathroom.
I am begging you.

138
Okay. Okay, fine,
but I just have one question for you.

139
When we exit, should we walk or run...

140
...or prance or stroll...?

141
Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,
but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!

142
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.

143
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.

144
- Hi.
- Charlie will be joining my department.

145
- You're a paleontologist too?
- Yeah.

146
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...

147
...of Renyard's new theory of species
variegation in segmented arthropods?

148
I think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.

149
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.

150
Renyard's theory of species variegation?

151
I saw the article on your coffee table.
I memorized the title to freak you out.

152
So did you two have fun?

153
Oh, my God. She's great.

154
We have so much in common, and she's
just cool, you know? And funny.

155
And I don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!

156
Hi!

157
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeling really well...

159
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the play.

160
Really? What's wrong?

161
I don't know.
I think it's kind of serious.

162
You know, I was watching this thing
on TV this morning...

163
...about Newcastle disease,
and I think I might have it.

164
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...

165
...that only affects chickens
and other poultry.

166
Okay, who's this?

167
I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.
She's a colleague.

168
Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...

169
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.

170
- Rachel, can I see you for a second?
- Sure.

171
You're not sick.

172
What? Yes, I am!

173
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?

174
When you're sick, you do whatever
you can to make yourself feel better.

175
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.

176
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.

177
Okay, then what is this?

178
Okay.

179
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof.

180
And he sent you guys to the play
to get rid of you.

181
What?!

182
What? What's going on?

183
Joey is having a secret
Days of our Lives party up on the roof!

184
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to tell you.

185
- You came to say you were sick.
- All right, professor or detective?

186
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?

187
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.

188
That's why he sent us to that medieval
restaurant and to that button factory.

189
And that horrible museum tour?

190
No, I arranged that.

191
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.

192
We know about your party, Joey.

193
- What party?
- The game's over. Take off your robe.

194
Okay, I mean...

195
No!

196
Close it up! Close it up!

197
Nice to meet you.

198
Hey, you made it! All right!

199
Glad you could make it.
Thanks for coming.

200
- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
- Hi.

201
I love you!

202
Hey. That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?

203
Just get yourself a drink
or something.

204
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.

205
Hey.

206
My God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?

207
I can barely control myself.

208
You might want to remember
that you're married.

209
Where is Chandler anyway?

210
Oh, my God! Chandler!

211
Where the hell is everybody?

212
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

213
Chapter 1: My First Period.

214
Hey, Joey said no autographs.

215
But if she's getting one,
I want one too!

216
"To Monica." And none of this
"best wishes" crap. I want "love."

217
Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.

218
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...

219
...I never would've gotten married!

220
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

221
- Call me.
- We will!

222
- Look at you with all the guys!
- Yeah.

223
I guess you've forgotten Joey.

224
Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten
aboutJoey.

225
And clearly, you've forgotten
about Chandler.

226
Please. Chandler's
the love of my life.

227
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!

228
So it's probably gonna be hard
for you to leave Boston, huh?

229
Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.
I just broke up with someone.

230
Oh, so sad.

231
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.

232
Especially after working with a Nobel
Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.

233
Actually, Albie is the guy
I broke up with.

234
- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
- Yeah.

235
And you called him "Albie"?

236
I mean, that's like calling
Albert Einstein...

237
Albie.

238
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.

239
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...

240
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!

241
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...

242
...he had a lot of issues.

243
Oh, like what?

244
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.
It's just that this must be...

245
...what regular people experience
when they watch Access Hollywood.

246
Okay, you want the dirt?

247
Albie was seriously insecure.

248
He was really intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.

249
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?

250
A guy who won two.

251
Two? What...?

252
Don't tell me you dated
Benjamin Hobart?

253
Yeah, for three years.

254
Oh, my God.

255
Have you ever dated someone
who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?

256
No.

257
But there was
my first boyfriend, Billy.

258
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?

259
No, but he did just win
a MacArthur "genius grant."

260
What a loser.

261
Some more wine?

262
Hey, Ross. How's it going
with Charlie?

263
Oh, great. After I finish my wine...

264
...I'm gonna blow
my average-sized brains out.

265
What's the matter?

266
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.

267
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earlier today...

268
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.

269
I always loved that.

270
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!

271
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.

272
They're so out of my league.

273
Oh, my God!

274
- Worse?
- Oh, much, much worse.

275
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
as one of the earliest amphibians.

276
"Can we walk?"

277
- Oh, you like that?
- No.

278
What?

279
Come on! I think that's funny!

280
Woolly mammoth.

281
L'I'S good!

282
I bet you're thinking that now would be
a great time for an intermission, huh?

283
Oh, yes. God, yes.

284
Well, you're not gonna get one!

285
Because in life, there are
no intermissions, people!

286
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!

287
How could he leave me?!

288
I don't know. You seem lovely.

289
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.

290
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what show are you on?

291
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paleontology.

292
- That's science.
- Oh.

293
Hey, well, listen,
I play a scientist on Days.

294
Yeah, my character just won
a Nobel Prize.

295
Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you two are together?

296
Oh. Well, no, but...

297
I mean, she only goes out
with really, really smart guys.

298
Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.

299
I'd lead with that.

300
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.

301
Monica!

302
Don't worry, Joe.
I won't come next year!

303
What the...?

304
What do you got there?

305
Just some boys gave me
their phone numbers.

306
- Oh, really? Let me see.
- Oh.

307
Damn, that's a lot of guys.

308
Are you a little slutty?

309
I think I am.

310
Let me see if I approve
of any of these clowns.

311
- This guy wears a rug.
- Well...

312
This guy's Canadian.

313
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?

314
It'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and I don't feel any different.

315
Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.

316
- Why? What's wrong with these guys?
- Well, nothing major.

317
It's just that, you know,
they're not really good enough for you...

318
...and you deserve the best.

319
Joey, you're so sweet.

320
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already
know who you're going home with.

321
Who?

322
Me.

323
What?

324
Really?

325
Yeah, because we live together.
It's a joke! It's a joke.

326
Right! That's funny! I get it!

327
- Got you!
- You're funny, Joey.

328
Oh, my God.

329
So how did you enjoy the play?

330
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.

331
You should be.

332
You missed the most powerful
three hours in the history of the theater.

333
- You really liked it?
- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.

334
But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,
I've been trained not to listen!

335
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...

336
...I was uplifted.

337
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

338
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.

339
Tell me...
Tell me about your first period.

340
No!

341
Did somebody sign your bra?

342
So I got it when I was 13.
Very difficult.

343
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?

344
Are you really just gonna let
a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?

345
What is that?
Come on, a piece of paper?

346
It's actually a million-dollar prize.

347
Go, Charlie!

348
But my point is...

349
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.

350
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.

351
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whole career in front of me.

352
I mean...

353
I could still win a Nobel Prize.

354
Although the last two papers
I've written were widely discredited.

355
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.

356
And sexy.

357
Okay, well, give her a chance
to see all that.

358
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

359
- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
- Good for you.

360
Your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.

361
Stop going through my stuff!

362
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
I just wanted to let you know
I've changed my mind.

364
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.

365
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.

366
Please! What about you and Chandler?

367
That's different.
I was drunk and stupid.

368
Well, hello?

369
What about all the guys that you got
the phone numbers from?

370
- Why don't you just kiss one of them.
- I could...

371
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.

372
All right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.

373
I'm gonna do it.

374
- And I can't stop you?
- No.

375
Hey, Rach, have you seen
Charlie anywhere?

376
I'm smarter than him!

377
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, Chandler.

378
This was a really important experience
for me. I wanted to share it with you.

379
You're so wonderful.

380
Why Don '2' You Like Me?

381
Chapter 1: My First Period.

382
I can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.

﻿1
It's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?

2
- I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
- I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.

3
But surprise!

4
I missed most of the party.

5
Charlie's a girl, right?

6
Yeah, she's this new professor
in my department that I did not kiss.

7
I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!

8
- Why do you care so much?
- Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?

9
Because Ross is the father of my child.

10
You know, and I want him
to hook up with lots of women.

11
All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey
and Charlie have anything in common.

12
I don't know. They seemed to have
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.

13
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?

14
And if the kids got her intelligence...

15
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...

16
...those nerds would get laid!

17
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? I mean...

18
It's no big deal.
I just met her. I'm fine with it.

19
God, I forgot how hot she was.

20
- I'm gonna get some more coffee.
- Hi.

21
- Oh, you know, I'll come with you.
- Okay.

22
- So a professor, huh?
- Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.

23
Her mind is totally acrimonious.

24
Guess that's not how she used it.

25
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

26
I don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.

27
I'm...

28
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really
hope you don't think less of me.

29
Think less of you? No.
I don't think less of you.

30
I mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.

31
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...

32
...those people are stupid.
I hate those people.

33
Actually, I'm a little surprised
at myself.

34
I mean, Joey's so different
from the guys I usually date.

35
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.

36
- You know, very cerebral...
- Yeah, I know the type.

37
If we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.

38
No?
Am I getting close?

39
- Hey!
- Hi.

40
Hey, you guys.
Look what I just got.

41
Oh, wow! I love those!
Where did you get them?

42
I bought them off eBay. They used
to belong to the late Shania Twain.

43
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.

44
Oh, then I overpaid.

45
Hey, what's this?

46
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.

47
You can't show Phoebe this. She hates
those corporate massage chains.

48
What, now I can't get a massage?

49
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.

50
I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.

51
I can't go hunting.

52
- Do you want to go hunting?
- I would like to have the option.

53
- What's that? Hey, Rachel?
- Ah...

54
No, you can't go there!

55
You know how I feel about
these big massage places.

56
They're putting people like me
out of business.

57
She wants to go hunting too!

58
Phoebe, come on,
I don't want to waste it.

59
It would be like throwing
away 100 bucks.

60
Okay, this is not about
the money. Okay?

61
It's about corporate greed
destroying our hearts...

62
...and leaving us hollow shells.

63
I don't care about any of that.

64
Well, do you care about friendship?
I feel really strongly about this.

65
Please don't use this gift certificate.
I'm asking you as a friend.

66
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!

67
Fine. I won't use it.

68
- Promise?
- I promise.

69
- Thank you.
- Well, I am going hunting.

70
Hey, honey. I missed you today.

71
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Hey.

72
- What do you wanna do tonight?
- Oh, well, maybe we could, uh...

73
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?

74
Know your audience.

75
Besides, tomorrow we're doing
those fertility tests.

76
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.

77
Do we really need to take those tests?

78
We've been trying
to have a baby for a year.

79
I think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.

80
- Just a few routine tests.
- But I don't want to do it in a cup.

81
- What is the big deal?
- It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.

82
It's not okay to do it
in a doctor's office...

83
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?

84
I cannot believe Ross told you that.

85
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.

86
Look, I don't want to do
these tests either.

87
But I really do think
it's a good idea.

88
I'm sure a doctor's office
can't be worse...

89
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.

90
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!

91
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?

92
- Hey!
- Hi.

93
- Come on in. How are you?
- I'm good.

94
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Please.

95
I have been crazed all day.

96
I had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...

97
...and I'm writing the foreword
for a book.

98
I had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today I had to open a door and go:

99
So I am just so excited to be here.

100
- I can't wait to explore the city.
- If you need a tour guide...

101
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.

102
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?

103
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.

104
Okay.

105
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.

106
I know.

107
- But first, I have to see the Met.
- Okay, let me stop you right there.

108
The Mets suck, okay?

109
You wanna see the Yankees.

110
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.

111
Which one? They all suck.

112
The museum.

113
I don't think so.

114
- Hi there.
- Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.

115
How may I help you?

116
Hi. I have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.

117
- Okay.
- And here is my gift certificate.

118
- This has been torn up.
- And taped back together.

119
Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon
as your massage therapist is ready.

120
- Okay.
- Have a seat through the glass doors.

121
- Through the glass doors.
- Through the glass doors.

122
Alrighty then.

123
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.

124
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?

125
Oh, no. No, no.

126
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?

127
- Sorry. Everyone is booked.
- That woman can't know I work here.

128
She's a friend of mine
and I made this big stink...

129
...about how awful
these massage chains are.

130
- Then why do you work here?
- Because it's good money.

131
But that doesn't change the fact...

132
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking
corporate machine.

133
Well, I think this is a great place
to work.

134
Okay, are they listening?

135
- Ross. Hey.
- Hi.

136
I need to talk to you about Charlie.

137
Oh, do you? Do you really?

138
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a little problem.

139
Look, if you don't know what the word
"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.

140
Look, you know Charlie, right?

141
- She's cool, funny, her body is so...
- Get to the problem.

142
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls I've ever dated.

143
Combined.

144
You know? And I just...
I don't want her to think I'm stupid.

145
Are you wearing two belts?

146
Hey, what do you know?

147
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.

148
Well, she wants to go
to all these cultural places...

149
...and I don't know how to talk about
that stuff. You gotta help me out.

150
I don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.

151
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person I know.

152
And I really like this girl, okay?
I don't want to lose her.

153
- Fine.
- Thanks.

154
Okay. Let's see.

155
- Oh, you should take her to the Met.
- The Mets.

156
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

157
Oh, that's what she meant.

158
If they're gonna shorten it, they
should call it the "Muse," you know?

159
Short for "museum"
and avoid all the confusion.

160
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.

161
Okay. All right,
so I'll take her to the Met.

162
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.

163
You know what?
She loves architecture.

164
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.

165
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.

166
Jeez. Sounds like you
should be going on this date.

167
But I'm not.

168
- And you know what...?
- Okay, slow down.

169
You're going way too fast. Okay?

170
- Just go back to the Met.
- Okay.

171
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.

172
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?

173
That's the antiquities wing.

174
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.

175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

176
Okay. So I walk in the door
and make a right.

177
I have a weird feeling about
this place. How do I know...

178
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the Internet?

179
Because, honey, and I mean this
in the sweetest way possible...

180
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.

181
Mr. Bing? Here you are.

182
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.

183
Deposit my specimen?

184
I usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.

185
Thanks. Got it.

186
All right. Honey, my tests
are down the hall.

187
- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

188
Look, I know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.

189
No one here even knows you.

190
Oh, my God!

191
Oh, come on!

192
How great is this?

193
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.

194
Why are you here?

195
Sid and I are trying again
and we had trouble last time...

196
No, no, no. I mean, why?
Why is she here?

197
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup. Ha, ha, ha.

198
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.

199
What?

200
This was fun. But I've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.

201
I'd love to stay
but I've got a hot date.

202
Please go. Just let me know
if you need a hand. Ha, ha, ha.

203
I think it just fell off.

204
Hello, ja.

205
It's time for your massage, ja?

206
Put your face in the hole.

207
A Swedish massage
from a real Swedish person.

208
Okay, then I'm Swedish.

209
So, what's your name?

210
It's a normal Swedish name.

211
Ikea.

212
- Wow. What an interesting name.
- Yeah.

213
- You know, I...
- Time for your scalp massage.

214
Oh.

215
Wow. I really love your...

216
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's just, um...

217
It just feels so good...

218
...lkea.

219
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?

220
Um...

221
Stockholm.

222
Damn. I wish I knew
if that was right.

223
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.

224
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...

225
...as his elusive subject
was light itself.

226
Now, do you have any idea
what you just said?

227
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."

228
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...

229
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
I just...

230
- I wrote that out phonetically for you.
- Phonetically?

231
Yeah, that means...
We just don't have time for this.

232
I gotta say, I'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.

233
I'm an actor.
I can memorize anything.

234
Last week on Days, I had to say:

235
"Frontal temporal
zygomatic craniotomy."

236
- Wow. What does that mean?
- No idea.

237
But the guy I said it to
dies in the next scene...

238
...so I guess it means,
"You'll get eaten by a bear."

239
Okay.

240
- So let's move on to the Renaissance.
- Okay.

241
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...

242
...to highlight the anguish
of the central figure.

243
Touch it. It's really bumpy.

244
Nuh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no. No ad-libbing.
And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.

245
- Come on.
- No. No!

246
My specimen's in the room.

247
I just want to thank whoever knocked
on the door while I was in there.

248
Really helped speed the process along.

249
Janice, you're not gone?

250
Sid is still in his room.

251
I don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.

252
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?

253
- Yeah. The hard part's over.
- That's not the hard part, honey.

254
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?

255
I haven't even thought
about the results.

256
I just assumed everything
would be okay.

257
Well, you know what? It probably is.

258
But what if it's not okay?

259
I mean, what if there's a reason
we can't have a baby?

260
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.

261
I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.

262
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't
believe I didn't even think of that.

263
I guess I was so worried about
having to come here and do that.

264
You can do it
in a Taco Bell parking lot...

265
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?

266
It was a Wendy's!

267
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.

268
Wow, lkea.

269
What a rich culture.

270
You know what?
I have a friend who's a masseuse.

271
- Oh? Ja, ja?
- Ja. She's not very good, though.

272
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

273
- And why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

274
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...

275
...from playing crummy guitar.

276
Or maybe she has trouble
loosening your knots...

277
...because you're such
a high-maintenance tight-ass.

278
- Phoebe!
- You know it's me?

279
Well, for like a half an hour!

280
Man, you can lie about Sweden!

281
How can you come here?

282
- Why didn't you tell me you work here?
- I don't have to tell you everything!

283
You do if you're gonna make me feel
guilty for getting a free massage.

284
- Tip's not included.
- Oh!

285
Why did you lie to me
about working here?

286
Because I was ashamed, okay?
I sold out for the cash.

287
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.

288
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now I'm this corporate stooge...

289
...and punching a clock...

290
...and paying taxes!

291
Phoebe, honey,
if you hate it so much...

292
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.

293
Be true to what you believe in.

294
Honey, you have principles,
and I so admire that.

295
I don't have any.

296
You know what? You're right.
I am gonna quit.

297
- It's time I took my life back.
- Good for you, Pheebs.

298
Okay.

299
If you guys have microphones in
there too, I didn't mean any of that.

300
I love you.

301
Aha! Got you! Die! Die! Die!

302
- Respectfully, Professor R. Geller. Hey.
- Hi.

303
- Hey, how was the Met?
- Oh!

304
- The museum was amazing.
- Yeah?

305
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?

306
Not so much, no.

307
He had clearly memorized
all this stuff to say...

308
...and some of it didn't
even make any sense.

309
- What do you mean?
- Well, for one...

310
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.

311
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
into the Met, did you go to the right?

312
- No. No, we went to the left.
- Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.

313
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.

314
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

315
What?

316
Actually, Joey's your friend...

317
...and you don't know me that well.
It'd be weird.

318
Well, I mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.

319
Well...

320
I'm thinking that maybe Joey
isn't the right guy for me right now.

321
You know, maybe I should
be with someone...

322
...I have more in common with.
You know what I mean?

323
Yeah.

324
Yeah, but you know what?

325
I think you should give Joey a chance.

326
I mean, he's a great guy.

327
And sure, he doesn't know
that much about art...

328
...but you can always talk about
that with someone else.

329
- I guess that's true.
- If you think about it...

330
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.

331
You know, that's the kind of guy
Joey is.

332
He is very sweet.

333
Plus, he is hot!

334
That was gonna be my next argument.

335
- Hey.
- Hey.

336
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

337
Wow.

338
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah.

339
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.

340
Glad I could help, man.

341
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
it would be, but I made it work.

342
It is not okay that I'm aroused
by this now.

343
Hello?

344
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.

345
No. Well, she's not here...

346
...but I can tell her.

347
Should I be sitting down for this?

348
Oh.

349
Uh-huh.

350
Well, so, what does that mean?

351
Okay. Okay, thank you.

352
Thanks.

353
Hey, sweetie.

354
Dr. Connelly just called.

355
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.

356
You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."

357
If it was good, you'd have said,
"Dr. Connelly just called!"

358
So, what is it? Is it?

359
Is there a problem? Is there
a problem with me, or with you?

360
Actually, it's both of us.

361
What?

362
Apparently, my sperm
have low motility...

363
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.

364
Oh.

365
Well, what does that mean?

366
It means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...

367
...and you have a uterus that is
prepared to kill the ones that do.

368
- It means...
- Wait, Chandler.

369
It means that we can keep trying...

370
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.

371
Oh, my God.

372
I'm sorry.

373
I'm sorry too.

374
Well...

375
...we're gonna figure this out.

376
I know.

377
- Good morning, Phoebe.
- Good morning, receptionist.

378
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1.

379
"Rachel Green."
Son of a bitch! She came back?

380
Are you ready for your Scottish massage?

381
Put your face in the hole, lassie!

﻿1
Oh, that feels so good.

2
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

3
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm sorry.

4
- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.
- From Cosmo?

5
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh:

6
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

7
So I have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

8
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

9
So you need someone who knows
fashion to, uh, tell you what looks good.

10
Not me. Not me. Not me.

11
- Oh, hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

12
- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
- Oh, well...

13
- I'm sure you have better things to do.
- You kidding?

14
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

15
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

16
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

17
If you have the time,
I'd really appreciate the help.

18
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

19
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes. Ha-ha-ha.

20
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

21
Okay, great. All right, bye.

22
Pain in the ass!

23
- That's off, right?
- What's the matter, Pheebs?

24
Ugh, Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

25
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you."

26
So now I have to go so he'll think
that I'm totally okay with seeing him.

27
- You're not. You're hung up on him.
- Exactly.

28
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

29
I didn't even think about that.

30
Ugh. Sexual politics!

31
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

32
- Come and I'll help you find something.
- That'd be great.

33
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

34
- That's not what we're gonna do.
- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

35
Wow.
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.

36
I still can't believe this.
My uterus is an inhospitable environment?

37
I've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

38
I can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

39
While I was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

40
- Hi there.
- Hi.

41
I'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

42
...but I wanted to talk to you
about your options.

43
Okay.

44
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

45
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

46
Oh, damn it!

47
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

48
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

49
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

50
Okay.

51
If you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

52
Is that a hint?

53
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

54
Wow. Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

55
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

56
- Let's do it.
- All right, have a good time.

57
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

58
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

59
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

60
- Uh, Chris Bailey?
- Yeah, right.

61
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

62
Why are you laughing?

63
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

64
It's fun. Yeah.

65
- You're up for keynote speaker?
- Yeah.

66
- Who's deciding?
- Professor Sherman.

67
- I'm meeting with him today.
- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

68
I think I know how to dazzle him.

69
Oh, you're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

70
Pfft. No.

71
- Hey, guys.
- I want to ask you something.

72
I may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

73
If I do, I'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

74
I think I can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

75
- It's in Barbados.
- But you come first.

76
I'm there.

77
- We'll see you guys.
- Bye.

78
- See you.
- Hey.

79
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
- Not as much fun as last time.

80
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

81
So, uh, what did the doctor say?

82
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

83
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

84
- So you're ruling out surrogacy?
- Yeah.

85
So I don't have to learn
what that means?

86
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

87
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

88
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

89
How do you feel about all this?

90
I wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

91
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

92
What?

93
What? No!
I'm not gonna give them Ben!

94
The data we're receiving
from MRI scans and DNA testing...

95
...of these fossils are staggering.

96
Mm-hm.

97
I mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

98
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...

99
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

100
...you know, right in the trash.

101
So, what I'm saying is...

102
Is that...

103
Is that, uh, repercussions could be huge.

104
I mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

105
...in evolutionary biology,
uh genetics, uh, geology.

106
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

107
Well, that's not what you want.

108
- Incentive for Men?
- I'll take some of that.

109
- That's for men.
- I know.

110
When I go to the party later...

111
...Mike will know I'm over him
because I'll smell like another guy.

112
Yeah.

113
Okay.

114
Oh, good, I'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

115
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.

116
I really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

117
Um, on Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.

118
Um, I think what you want is over here.

119
See, I told you I needed someone.

120
By the way, as a thank you,
I would really love to take you out.

121
- Really?
- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

122
- You want to come?
- Oh, I can't.

123
Because I've seen them.

124
You've seen all the movies?

125
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

126
Of the movies.

127
You know, motion pictures.

128
The talkies.

129
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

130
- Sure.
- Okay.

131
Maybe we could do something else.

132
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.

133
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

134
She's okay. I don't know, I just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

135
- Why?
- I don't know.

136
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

137
...and tall, you know...

138
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

139
Who else?

140
Anybody.

141
You.

142
Me.

143
You know, Monica's mom.

144
- You like Joey?
- Shh! Phoebe!

145
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him. Just...

146
- Oh, my God.
- It's just physical.

147
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together...

148
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

149
Wow. Isn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like...?

150
I get it!

151
All right, as long as it's under control.

152
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

153
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

154
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.

155
- So can we keep this between us?
- Sure.

156
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

157
- Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
- Mm.

158
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

159
I brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

160
Oh, of course. It's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

161
- You too.
- You guys haven't actually met before.

162
But, boy, you're both polite.

163
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

164
- I got it.
- Thanks.

165
- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

166
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

167
Excuse me?

168
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

169
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

170
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

171
"Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm."

172
I invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

173
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

174
- Chandler!
- I'm telling you, he's great.

175
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
I think he'd be the way to go.

176
I'm not going to be a part of this.

177
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

178
Okay.

179
- Zack?
- Thanks.

180
Do you have a coaster?
I don't want to make a ring.

181
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

182
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
It'd be so bad if she heard.

183
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

184
- See if you can hear me.
- Okay, great.

185
Oh, thank God,
I can't hear a word that you're saying.

186
- I didn't say anything yet.
- Well, get back in there and talk.

187
I'm Rachel.

188
It's so annoying when I put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

189
What?

190
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

191
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

192
- We have a problem.
- Oh, what are we gonna do?

193
Just be honest with her.

194
Oh, my God!

195
It is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

196
All right, enough out of you!

197
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

198
No, she, uh, went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

199
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

200
- How's it going?
- It could be better.

201
He, um... He fell asleep.

202
What? But I already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

203
- Barbados.
- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

204
You have to get that job.

205
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.

206
In fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

207
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to "spank him harder."

208
- Well, just wake him up.
- I can't.

209
If he realizes that I'm the one who
put him to sleep, I won't get the job.

210
Ooh, that's a tough one.

211
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

212
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. I...

213
No, wait a minute.

214
It was me who fell asleep.

215
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

216
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
- I'm gonna go wash up first.

217
Thanks.

218
What do you think? I want his genes for
my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

219
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

220
- You don't like him.
- I think he's fine.

221
But we don't know
anything real about him.

222
- I wish we could get more information.
- All right, just follow my lead.

223
- You guys have a great place here.
- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

224
Hey, speaking of crazy...

225
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

226
Uh, no. Although, I did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

227
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

228
Okay.

229
So, um, tell me, how'd you guys meet?

230
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

231
I've got a better question for you:

232
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

233
No.

234
Uh, heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

235
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

236
We're just making conversation.

237
Yeah, well, okay.
I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

238
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

239
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and I'm flattered...

240
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

241
Can we just talk about something else?

242
- Sure.
- All right.

243
This ravioli's delicious.

244
I notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

245
Did you have braces as a child?

246
- No, I didn't.
- Yes!

247
We're teeth people, Zack.

248
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

249
- Good plan.
- Okay.

250
- What? Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

251
I don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

252
I still have to find something
incredible to wear...

253
...so I can beat Mike
at "Who's More Over Who"!

254
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

255
- Where have you been?
- Trying on clothes.

256
Oh, really? In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

257
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

258
Rachel, I heard you
two guys whispering.

259
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

260
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.

261
Phoebe likes Joey.

262
Yeah.

263
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

264
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

265
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

266
It's, like, she's nympho.

267
- Wow!
- Yeah.

268
You know, by the way, I heard you
tell her not to do anything.

269
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

270
I try.

271
Oh!

272
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

273
Thank you!

274
You're welcome.

275
Wow! You look...

276
...stop-eating hot!

277
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

278
Okay, are you sure? Because I am
really dreading going to this party.

279
Then don't go.

280
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't show
up, he'll think it's because of him...

281
...and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

282
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

283
Afterward, you come to my place
and I'll get you good and drunk.

284
You got it. Okay.

285
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

286
Because I just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

287
David?

288
Phoebe! Hi.

289
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

290
Wow! You look unbelievable.

291
Oh, yeah, well...

292
What are you doing here?

293
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Uh, permanently.

294
Well, what happened?

295
Remember how I was trying
to achieve...

296
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

297
Yeah.

298
Well, after eight years of research,
I discovered...

299
...that it can't be done.

300
Well...

301
...great that you're back. How are you?

302
- Good. Good. Life is good.
- Good.

303
- Well, I'm seeing someone.
- Oh.

304
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

305
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and, um...

306
It's actually because of you
that we're together.

307
I mean, I saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

308
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

309
- Mike and I broke up.
- You're kidding me.

310
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.

311
- Really?
- I don't know why, I'm sorry.

312
I guess I just didn't want
to lose face.

313
I understand.

314
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...

315
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

316
- That's so not like us.
- Yeah, I know.

317
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

318
...but, um, do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

319
Well...

320
No.

321
- Well, do you want to get a drink?
- I'd love to.

322
- Great.
- Okay.

323
Uh, do you smell beets?

324
Oh, all right, stay upwind of me.

325
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?

326
No, that's David.

327
There's a third guy?

328
Tip of the iceberg.

329
I'm gonna take off now.

330
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

331
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

332
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.

333
Are you always tired?

334
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

335
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

336
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

337
Bye.

338
I think we found our sperm.

339
He does seem pretty perfect.

340
Yeah? You think so?
Should I ask him?

341
No.

342
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

343
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

344
No, that's not it.

345
It's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

346
...I just realized I don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

347
- He's not you.
- Yeah, he's better!

348
No, he's not.

349
If I can't get pregnant with you,
then I don't want to get pregnant by him...

350
...or anyone else.

351
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

352
Thank God, because I
don't wanna do this either.

353
I was just doing it because I thought
that was what you wanted.

354
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

355
That is so sweet.

356
I love you.

357
So you know this leaves us with...

358
Adoption.

359
How do you feel about that?

360
I think I feel okay about it.

361
Actually, I think I feel
really good about it.

362
Me too.

363
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and I wanna raise it with you.

364
And I wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

365
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

366
Yeah.

367
- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
- We are gonna be great parents.

368
And it could be soon.

369
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

370
...our baby could be being conceived.

371
Wait. If we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

372
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

373
Hey, Zack.

374
Hey, Chandler.

375
I wanted to apologize for last night.

376
I got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

377
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

378
No, you did.

379
My wife and I have
some boundary issues.

380
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

381
We're working on it.

382
- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
- Thank you.

383
You wouldn't know if she's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?

﻿1
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
Oh, that's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
We're going to a conference
in Barbados. Right?

4
- Uh-huh.
- Can you say, "Barbados"?

5
Barbados.

6
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so
much to me that you guys are coming...

7
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

8
Ooh, and I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

9
...but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

10
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

11
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

12
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

13
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.

14
David'll probably want to hear
a few lectures.

15
- Right, because he's a scientist.
- No, no.

16
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

17
...he'll die.

18
Okay, we'd better go. Yeah?

19
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- All right, let's do it.

20
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

21
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

22
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

23
- Wow, this place is beautiful!
- Look at all these paleontologists!

24
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

25
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here!

26
I think I've been recognized.

27
- This happens all the time.
- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

28
That never happens.

29
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

30
- Wow. This is very flattering...
- I would love your autograph.

31
Well, sure. Um...

32
- "Dear?"
- Sarah.

33
"Sarah. I dig you."

34
- "Dr. Ross Geller."
- Oh, thank you so much.

35
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

36
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.
- Are you a paleontologist?

37
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

38
You probably recognize me from a
little show called The Days of Our Lives.

39
Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives.
There's no "the."

40
Okay, Ross, boy, you... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

41
- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
- You don't own a TV?

42
What's all your furniture pointed at?

43
David, can you help me?

44
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

45
Oh, certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

46
...and Newton's third law of motion.
- See?

47
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

48
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

49
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

50
...or should Mike and I meet you?

51
Mike? Who's Mike?

52
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
- That's right!

53
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

54
- That's a blast from the past, huh?
- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

55
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

56
...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

57
- She does?
- Let's get you out of here.

58
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

59
I'm so sorry. I just...
I keep thinking about Mike.

60
I'm crazy about David,
and we're having so much fun together.

61
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...
That's gonna go away, right?

62
- Well, I guess. In time.
- Yeah.

63
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

64
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

65
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

66
I wouldn't read too much into it.

67
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

68
...that's not a good thing, right?
- Let me stop you there.

69
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

70
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

71
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

72
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

73
- Well, you know Phoebe...
- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

74
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

75
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
- Oh, because his penis was too big.

76
I'm sorry.
That's the kind of thing I do.

77
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

78
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

79
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

80
What?

81
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

82
- No, I didn't mean now.
- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

83
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

84
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but..."

85
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
- Well, you're welcome.

86
Glad I could help.

87
- How do you think I should propose?
- I'm pretending to read here.

88
I'm sorry.

89
Yeah. How you doing?

90
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

91
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

92
Ha, ha, I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

93
You really should have been
more clear about that.

94
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

95
Oh, uh, uh, Britney Spears!

96
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

97
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
- Oh, my God!

98
- I know!
- Did you talk to him?

99
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

100
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

101
- You ready to go?
- You're gonna go now?

102
- I thought we could hang out.
- I can't. I have seminars all day.

103
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

104
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? It'll be romantic.

105
Will you wear a thong?

106
I will if you will.

107
You got yourself a very weird deal.

108
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

109
- So you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

110
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

111
Joe, have you looked outside?

112
No. Why?

113
- Oh, man.
- There's an indoor pool.

114
- You could swim there.
- Yeah.

115
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

116
That "Mike" was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

117
...with Phoebe and David.
- I do. Want a hint, huh?

118
I do.

119
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

120
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

121
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
- What? Why?

122
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

123
...and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

124
Chandler, we have talked about this.

125
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

126
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

127
I did! A penis one!

128
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

129
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

130
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

131
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

132
...and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

133
Man, that's some bad advice.

134
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

135
- What's going on?
- Everything is upside-down here.

136
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

137
I don't want to alarm anybody...

138
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

139
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

140
...it gets a little extra body, okay?

141
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

142
I'll show you guys where to check in.

143
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

144
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

145
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

146
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

147
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

148
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

149
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

150
- Not Joey.
- Not Joey. No.

151
- I was just lusting after Chandler.
- Yeah, right.

152
So I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

153
Tonight?

154
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

155
Oh, there it is.

156
Yes, well, being a failed scientist...

157
...doesn't pay quite as well
as you might think.

158
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

159
And the clarity is quite poor.

160
Nice.

161
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay.

162
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

163
See what happens
when you give people advice?

164
- Well, I hope you told him not to.
- That would be advice!

165
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

166
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

167
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you leaving the Supremes?

168
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

169
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

170
Wow, really?

171
That's fantastic!

172
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

173
- What about Mike?
- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

174
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

175
...and force him down the aisle, okay?

176
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

177
You know? It's every girl's dream.

178
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

179
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike... David!

180
David! I love David.

181
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

182
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

183
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century."

184
It's great.

185
You'll be the hit
of the conference.

186
It'll be even better tomorrow...

187
...because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

188
...checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

189
- Hey, guys.
- The chocolates aren't here.

190
Damn it!

191
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

192
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

193
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

194
What? May I?

195
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

196
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

197
- The wet season is June to December.
- It's not the time, Charlie.

198
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

199
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

200
Secret teapot.

201
Your computer. I don't know what...
Everything's gone.

202
- What do you mean?
- Must be a virus.

203
I think it erased your hard drive.

204
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

205
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

206
- Why? Why would you open it?
- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

207
- What did it say?
- "Nude..."

208
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

209
- I'm so sorry.
- What am I gonna do?

210
- My speech is gone!
- It's not gone.

211
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

212
No, I don't!

213
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

214
- It's really gone?
- Yep.

215
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

216
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

217
- I just feel awful.
- Yeah, you should.

218
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova?
She's never even won a major tournament.

219
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

220
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

221
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

222
Get out.

223
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

224
- What do you do?
- I usually go...

225
...play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

226
I can't believe this is happening.

227
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

228
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

229
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

230
I don't think your monologue from
Star Wars is gonna help me right now.

231
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

232
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.
- What, you really think we can do that?

233
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

234
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

235
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

236
All right. Okay, let's do it.

237
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

238
And then I move on
to what is clearly the defining moment...

239
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

240
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

241
Ooh, ooh. Any chance any of this
happened in a galaxy far, far away?

242
- Hello?
- Okay, Mike?

243
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

244
So get over your
I-never-wanna-get-married thing...

245
...and step up!

246
Who is this?

247
This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.

248
Listen. Phoebe is back with David.

249
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

250
...but I know she really wants to be
with you.

251
He's gonna propose?

252
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

253
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

254
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

255
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

256
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

257
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

258
What do you do in the humidity?

259
Damn it!

260
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Aw, I hope you're happy too, honey.

261
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

262
- That's what happens when you meddle.
- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

263
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

264
- There's no chance that will work?
- No, I called.

265
- It's not gonna happen.
- Meddler! Meddler!

266
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

267
...then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

268
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

269
...the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

270
This vacation sucks!

271
- I'm so bored.
- Mm.

272
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

273
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

274
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

275
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

276
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

277
You feel like going to a convention?

278
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.
- I know we're not...

279
...but Frank Madaio and Eva...

280
- Kate Miller.
- Kate Miller it is.

281
- Okay.
- Oh, good...

282
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

283
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

284
Thank you.

285
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

286
...into the 21 st century.

287
Well, yeah. That's it?

288
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. We did it.

289
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

290
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

291
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

292
That's a pretty necklace.

293
Thank you.

294
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

295
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

296
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

297
Oh, my God, I love you.

298
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

299
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

300
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

301
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

302
You've been married more than once?

303
No.

304
Mm.

305
So why'd you break up?

306
Oh, it was...

307
It's complicated, you know?
She was, uh...

308
...gay.

309
Oh, my God.

310
This is so cool!

311
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

312
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

313
Hey! High-five!

314
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

315
My fiancé was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

316
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

317
She didn't get any fitter.

318
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
- I know.

319
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

320
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

321
- I know.
- And then...

322
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

323
...so you float the idea of a threesome.

324
I didn't do that.

325
Me neither.

326
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

327
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

328
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

329
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

330
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

331
...with the really nice breasts.

332
But what about back home?

333
Anything going on there?
Anybody you like?

334
No.

335
- There is. You're blushing.
- No, I'm not blushing...

336
...and I'm sunburned.

337
From, you know, the rain.

338
You like someone. Tell me who.

339
- Tell me who it is. Come on.
- No. Joey.

340
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

341
- Who do you like?
- Joey, come on!

342
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

343
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

344
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

345
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Do you?

346
- Yeah.
- Hey.

347
- Hey.
- I just left you a message.

348
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

349
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

350
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

351
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

352
- I had a great time.
- Yeah.

353
This isn't over,
because I really want to know...

354
Later. Later.

355
- So shall we?
- Yeah.

356
- Okay.
- Good night.

357
Good night.

358
- Okay, good night.
- Good night, Ross.

359
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

360
She's clearly in love with Mike.

361
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

362
Um... Phoebe, um,
I have, uh, something I want to say.

363
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

364
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

365
"Uh, Phoebe, um, I would be honored
if, uh, uh..." Spit it out, David!

366
Uh, Phoebe, um...

367
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

368
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

369
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

370
But, um, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

371
So to that end...

372
- Oh, my God, Mike.
- It's David, actually.

373
No, Mike's here.

374
Oh, hey, Mike.

375
Hi, David.

376
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

377
It's the humidity!

378
- Hi, Phoebe.
- What are you doing here?

379
I have a question I need to ask you.

380
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

381
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

382
Okay.

383
- Would you care for my seat as well?
- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

384
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

385
Phoebe, I love you.

386
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

387
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

388
...but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

389
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

390
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

391
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

392
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

393
If the rain stops.

394
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

395
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

396
- I have a ring.
- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

397
But, Phoebe...

398
...will you marry me?

399
No.

400
Ha-ha.

401
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

402
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

403
- That we had a future.
- We can have any future you want.

404
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

405
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

406
Just so I know,
if I had asked first?

407
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

408
Please, you don't have to explain.

409
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

410
...things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

411
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

412
It was a good trip.

413
- Is it okay if I hug you now?
- Oh, yes.

414
Because of our meddling! All right?

415
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

416
Oh, I know.

417
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

418
- The sun is out!
- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

419
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

420
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.
- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

421
- No!
- Damn it!

422
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

423
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

424
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

425
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

426
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

427
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

428
Giganotosaurus.

429
- Argentinosaurus."
- Not to mention Coldsaurus.

430
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

431
Their heads are already too big.

432
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

433
Really?

434
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

435
...that Homo ergaster is thought to be a
separate species from Homo erectus..."

436
- What?
- He said "erectus."

437
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he really said it.

438
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

439
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of Homo erectus..."

440
Erectus?

441
- Homo.
- Right.

442
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

443
Thank you.

444
- Really great.
- Thanks, guys.

445
I thought it was wonderful.

446
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

447
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and...

448
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

449
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

450
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

451
- Take it easy.
- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

452
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

453
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

454
Oh.

455
I'm back.

456
Okay. Well, excuse me?

457
Hey.

458
- Well?
- You were incredible.

459
You blew them away.

460
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

461
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

462
- I was not.
- No, it's okay.

463
It made me feel like a rock star.

464
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

465
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

466
Look, I took it too far.

467
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

468
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

469
...all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

470
Not you guys.

471
You've got it going on.

472
- What will we do today?
- They have a game room downstairs.

473
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

474
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

475
- Let's play.
- I don't think so.

476
- Why not?
- You know how competitive you get.

477
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

478
- I'm not always that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

479
What happened when we played
last time?

480
I punched you.

481
- And?
- Phoebe.

482
- And?
- I clunked your heads together.

483
- There you are.
- Hey. Listen.

484
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

485
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

486
...he chases you.

487
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

488
Oh.

489
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

490
I'd do it alone, but, uh...

491
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

492
You know, I feel so bad.

493
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night...

494
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

495
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

496
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

497
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

498
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?
- Yeah.

499
A little bit, yeah.

500
I think we need to talk.

501
Yeah, I think we do.

502
About what?

503
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
- All right.

504
- I'll play if we don't keep score.
- Well, then how do we know who wins?

505
- Nobody wins.
- So we're just four losers. Super.

506
- Well, I'm not playing with her.
- I'm out.

507
- I'll play you.
- Okay.

508
- You don't know what you're doing.
- She gets crazy.

509
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

510
I think I'll be all right.

511
- You want to volley a bit for serve?
- Sure, if you want to.

512
Ho!

513
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

514
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

515
- You ready to play?
- Hell, yeah.

516
- Did you know this about him?
- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

517
- Want to make it more interesting?
- How much you thinking?

518
- Ten bucks a game?
- Make it 50.

519
- I'll make it 100.
- One thousand...

520
Okay!

521
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

522
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

523
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

524
- Monica, you call it.
- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

525
- Tails.
- Oh, what are the chances?

526
- Hah! My point!
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

527
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

528
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

529
He was a lawyer.

530
All the East Coast
is having beautiful weather.

531
In New York, it's 72 and sunny.

532
Oh. Weather bitch.

533
It's open.

534
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

535
- What? Is everything okay?
- Charlie and I broke up.

536
No. Why?

537
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

538
That's crazy.

539
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

540
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

541
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

542
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

543
- Man, smart people are dull.
- Well, hey!

544
Okay, Rach.

545
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

546
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

547
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like... What the hell's my problem?

548
I just...

549
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

550
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

551
- I'm not talking about her.
- Well, then, who?

552
The waitress I went out with last month?

553
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no, no.

554
- Who are you talking about?
- No, I don't...

555
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so...

556
- Okay.
- Yeah.

557
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

558
- And I'll see you later.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

559
- You like me?
- Okay.

560
- Let's not make a big thing about this.
- It's a huge thing!

561
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

562
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

563
Musings, if you will.

564
- Well, for how long?
- Oh, only like a month.

565
- A month?!
- Well...

566
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

567
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

568
- Okay, dial it up a little.
- Oh, you're right. Okay.

569
- I just have a question.
- Shoot.

570
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not trying to do anything.

571
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

572
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

573
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

574
...George!

575
Who?

576
- Curious George!
- Oh!

577
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

578
- Of course. I remember.
- He had a paper route.

579
Yeah, he did.

580
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- No, I know. We're great!

581
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

582
Can't it just happen a little bit?

583
- No! It can't happen at all!
- Why not?

584
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

585
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

586
...and not once did I ever say no.

587
I couldn't do it to Ross.

588
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
- I know. I know...

589
...but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

590
I'm sorry.

591
I'm sorry too.

592
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

593
- Like you said, it's no big deal.
- It's not a big deal.

594
- No big deal.
- It's so not a big deal.

595
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.
- Okay, great.

596
Okay... Oh!

597
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...
I think that may have missed the table.

598
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

599
- Do you?
- Yeah.

600
- Do you?
- Yeah!

601
- You really find this attractive on him?
- Oh, yeah.

602
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

603
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

604
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

605
Knock that dog off her head.

606
- Oh, damn it!
- I sleep with him!

607
- Game point.
- Don't get too cocky.

608
Remember, I won the last one.

609
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

610
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

611
- No! No! No!
- And that's how it's done.

612
Okey-dokey.

613
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

614
Everybody goes home a winner.

615
- Best of three?
- What I'm thinking.

616
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

617
- Serve the ball, chump.
- "Serve the ball, chump."

618
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

619
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

620
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

621
...just nifty.

622
Well, I've kind of got a lot
on my plate right now.

623
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

624
- Jarvis?
- Oh, you're back.

625
- This is my wife, Nancy.
- Well, get out!

626
Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?

627
Yes, please.

628
So, what's going on?

629
Well, Joey and I broke up.

630
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Joey is a great guy...

631
...but we're just...
We're so different.

632
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

633
I knew that was him!

634
Anyway, I just...
I think it's for the best.

635
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I guess.

636
There was...

637
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

638
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

639
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

640
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

641
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

642
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?
- Or we could throw you both in now.

643
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

644
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

645
...and most importantly
you will have to catch us first.

646
Go! Go! Go!

647
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41.

648
- Okay, look, enough is enough.
- No.

649
- I just have two more points to beat him.
- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

650
I mean, please, look at you.

651
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

652
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

653
We missed our dinner reservation,
let's go upstairs...

654
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

655
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

656
You knew this about me
when you married me.

657
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

658
Well, this is my sickness!

659
- What about the obsessive cleaning?
- That's just good sense.

660
Ow!

661
- You okay?
- No, honey, I'm okay.

662
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

663
Oh, my God. I can't play.

664
- So you forfeit?
- Mike wins?

665
I can't believe it. I lost.

666
- No, you didn't.
- What?

667
- Because I'm gonna play for you.
- You can't do that.

668
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

669
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

670
- Honey, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

671
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

672
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

673
Because I love you.

674
But you suck.

675
You're welcome, sweetheart.

676
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

677
- Whoever wins this point, wins.
- Okay.

678
- Oh, my God. You're good.
- It's like watching porn.

679
And that's how it's done.

680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

681
Well, when did you...?

682
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

683
- When did you stop sucking?
- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

684
...to know how good I was.
- Why?

685
- I don't know.
- Well, this is so great.

686
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
- That's why.

687
- They still looking for us?
- Yeah.

688
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

689
The herbivores and the carnivores.

690
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

691
Oh, look out.

692
- I don't think they saw us.
- I don't think they did.

693
So I started to tell you
something earlier. Um...

694
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

695
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

696
...for someone else.

697
Oh.

698
And can I ask who?

699
I think you know.

700
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so...

701
- I'm sorry, we can't.
- All right. All right.

702
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

703
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

704
Or not. I mean...

705
What?

706
Oh.

﻿1
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

2
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?

3
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.

4
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.

5
- Oh, my God!
- What? Monday?

6
- How long do you have to go for?
- They said it could be up to a year.

7
- A year?
- Well, do you have to go?

8
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

9
Because of this stupid thing.

10
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?

11
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

12
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

13
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

14
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

15
You can't go. I mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.

16
- Really?
- Not you.

17
I can't believe you guys are moving.

18
- I call their apartment!
- No!

19
No!

20
Here you go, Rach.

21
- Oh, thank you, Joey.
- Yeah.

22
Oh, you know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

23
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.

24
Yeah, just to be sure,
I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

25
- Every time?
- Mm-hm.

26
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?

27
- Trust me. I know this.
- All right. I trust you.

28
I can see you dialing.
I don't understand why...

29
Shh, I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

30
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. It's just so grown-up.

31
I know, yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.

32
A person named "Wiener."
God, that kills me.

33
- Look at you all grown-up.
- Yeah.

34
Well, actually, you know what?

35
I am, you know?

36
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize...

37
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?

38
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.

39
And looks aren't as important as...

40
- Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Mm-hm

41
You know, I might know somebody.

42
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?

43
I can do that. Yeah.
How's, uh, Friday?

44
- Done!
- All right.

45
- Oh, good, really?
- Yeah.

46
Okay, let's see. Hee, hee.

47
All right.

48
Um, oh, you know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

49
"Poopack"? Ha-ha-ha.

50
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

51
- Hi.
- Hey.

52
- I've got good news.
- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

53
Okay, I have news.

54
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

55
That's great! How?

56
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

57
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

58
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

59
No.

60
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

61
No. I can't be away
from you for that long.

62
- Really?
- Yeah, you're my husband.

63
I won't live in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

64
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.

65
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

66
Ha-ha-ha. Hey.

67
You said that without gagging.

68
I know!

69
Well, excuse me?

70
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!

71
- Who the hell was that?
- Dr. Wiener.

72
Rach, you can't call people
at 3 in the morning.

73
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.

74
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

75
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

76
What was it?

77
Hiccups.

78
I told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.

79
Well, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

80
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

81
Wait, wait, wait. Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...

82
...you liked your doctor.
What was his name?

83
Dr. Gettleman?

84
Uh, yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

85
- In fact, I think... I think he's dead.
- Ugh!

86
Why does everything happen to me?

87
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.

88
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.

89
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?

90
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

91
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.

92
Wiener!

93
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

94
Rachel!

95
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

96
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?

98
Oh, my God.

99
Ooh. Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

100
Yeah, so you, uh, found someone
for me? You didn't forget?

101
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.

102
She's really smart and cute
and funny and...

103
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

104
- All right.
- Yeah.

105
- So tell me something about my guy.
- No.

106
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

107
- Mike. Yeah.
- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

108
Damn it! Is there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!

109
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.

110
All right, great.

111
- All right, bye. Yeah.
- See you. Bye-bye.

112
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't I have said?

113
There's no guys in there!

114
Ugh, it's impossible
to find a good doctor.

115
How do you know the good ones...

116
...from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?

117
Excuse me?

118
I know what she's talking about.

119
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

120
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.

121
- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
- Ross said he died.

122
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.

123
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

124
Oh, great. Well then,
I'm gonna take Emma to see him.

125
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

126
Oh, maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.

127
He saw a therapist?

128
Mm-hm. He used to have
a recurring nightmare. It freaked him out.

129
Wow, what was it?

130
That I was going to eat him.

131
Mike!

132
Yeah?

133
Okay.

134
I can't believe
I'm doing this with you.

135
Although I did just end
a nine-year relationship...

136
...so I should be open
to taking some risks.

137
It'll be fine. Follow my lead, okay? All you
have to do is pretend to be Mike.

138
- I am Mike.
- Attaboy.

139
Here they come.

140
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Hey, Phoebe.

141
- I'm Mike.
- Nice to meet you.

142
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

143
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

144
Uh, how do Joey and I
know each other?

145
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.

146
- From school.
- We met in college.

147
I mean high school.

148
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

149
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
- Mike, attorney at law! Ha, ha.

150
- Actually, I just gave up my practice.
- What?

151
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me. Ha, ha.

152
I want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now, I never will.

153
Great. I like that better
than the lawyer thing.

154
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike. Ha, ha.

155
You thought he was still a lawyer.

156
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.

157
- Hey.
- Hey.

158
What are you doing?

159
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.

160
Aw, that's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

161
- Slim Pickins.
- Hmm. Nothing, huh?

162
No. Slim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

163
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

164
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.

165
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

166
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

167
Heh, honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy...

168
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

169
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

170
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

171
So Cheesy?

172
Whole Hog?

173
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.

174
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

175
I'm good. Listen, I'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.

176
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated. Ha, ha.

177
Because I love him.

178
No, I don't want a job in New York.

179
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

180
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!

181
Oh, uh, wow, this is really,
really flattering.

182
But, um, I'm moving to Tulsa.

183
So, just, if you would tell Javu...

184
...I'll take it!

185
Hi. Um, my name's Rachel Green.
I have an appointment for Emma.

186
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.

187
Okay, thank you.

188
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.

189
Thanks, doctor.

190
- Would you like a lollipop?
- Do you even have to ask?

191
He is alive!

192
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long...

193
...and I've never heard about you.

194
Oh, that's, uh, because we had
a bit of a falling out.

195
Mike hit my mom with a car.

196
- No, I didn't.
- That's okay. I have forgiven you.

197
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great. Heh.

198
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

199
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.

200
Wow, you're a lot nicer
on Days of Our Lives.

201
Days of Our Lives!
That's why you look so familiar!

202
- What?
- What?

203
What?

204
Do you not know each other?

205
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.

206
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.

207
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cool?

208
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

209
- Six.
- What are you doing? I said seven!

210
Oh.

211
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

212
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

213
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

214
You are unbelievable. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.

215
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.

216
Hey.

217
Oh, who are you kidding?

218
You find some guy
off the street for me?

219
God, this is humiliating!

220
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.

221
- Mike? Mike?
- Oh.

222
I'm out of here.

223
It was nice meeting you.

224
- You're leaving too?
- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

225
- Have a good night.
- Mm-hm.

226
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.

227
You're right.

228
Maybe I shouldn't go.

229
- What?
- Um.

230
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

231
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.

232
Well, how far outside?

233
Manhattan?

234
And, uh, you're thinking of taking it?

235
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

236
But I guess now it's, uh,
old job, me, new job.

237
- I'm gonna miss this hand!
- Ha, ha.

238
I know this is a lot to ask...

239
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

240
What happened to "you can't live
without me four days a week"?

241
Well, if you really think about it,
I mean, four days is not that long.

242
I see you Monday
before you go to work...

243
...and Thursday when you get back...

244
...and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it, ha, ha...

245
...it's really just one day.

246
Um, well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.

247
- I think you should take the job.
- Really?

248
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.

249
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

250
- Hey.
- Hi.

251
- How was the pediatrician?
- Oh, I really liked him.

252
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.

253
- You promised not to say anything.
- I know.

254
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

255
I don't care.

256
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?

257
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

258
- Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
- Mm.

259
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

260
Why? I know it's a little weird,
but, hey, he is a great doctor, okay?

261
He knows my medical history.

262
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.

263
You know,
"Ah, look, it's my favorite patient."

264
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

265
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.

266
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.

267
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

268
Oh, excuse me, uh.

269
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Uh, can we talk?

270
Sure.

271
I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed.

272
Is it all right?

273
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.

274
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

275
Well, why did you go along with that?

276
Because I was told that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

277
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.

278
That's true.

279
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?

280
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.

281
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Prove it.

282
There isn't a piano here.

283
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

284
Okay.

285
You are really good.

286
Uh, um.

287
- I play a little guitar myself.
- Really?

288
- Uh-huh.
- That's great.

289
- What kind of music do you play?
- Um, like acoustic, folksy stuff.

290
But right now I'm working on
a couple Iron Maiden covers.

291
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I could, uh...

292
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

293
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I could take you out?

294
Oh, you just caught me off guard, um.

295
Yeah, that would be nice.

296
Look at this! My two best friends!

297
Excuse me, uh.
I don't mean to be a jerk...

298
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

299
The doctor will be right with you, sir.

300
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

301
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.

302
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?

303
Yeah, that's how I know.

304
- I'm Ross, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Sally.

305
Hi.

306
So no ring. Can I assume
you're also a single parent?

307
- I am a single parent.
- It's hard, isn't it?

308
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

309
Well, um...

310
...let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office. Uh.

311
Rossie? We're ready for you.

312
Um, yeah...

313
Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.

314
Mommy.

315
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

316
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

317
- Oh, good, you haven't left yet.
- Where have you been?

318
I got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office, um.

319
There was some guy that, uh,
freaked everybody out.

320
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.

321
Oh, man.

322
- Promise to call me when you land?
- Of course I will. I love you.

323
I love you too.

324
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

325
Whoa, watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.

326
- Bye, Chandler.
- Aw. Bye.

327
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

328
- What's the matter, Joe?
- I'm mad at you for leaving.

329
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.

330
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

331
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?

332
Aw, dude, you see right through me!

333
Okay, well... Bye, Mon.

334
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

335
- Bye, Emma.
- Okay, bye-bye.

336
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.

337
Chandler.

338
Wait.

339
It goes old job...

340
...new job...

341
...and you.

342
This is just something I have to do.

343
I know.

344
I love you so much.

345
I know that too.

346
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

347
Yes, it will be the same.

348
Because I know, that's how.

349
I promise.

350
You double promise?

351
Call me when you land.

352
- Can I talk now?
- Okay, bye.

353
- Joey!
- He had to board.

﻿1
Oh. Hey, Ross.

2
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?

3
- Sure.
- Thank you.

4
Can you believe no one
between my apartment and here...

5
...offered to do that for me?

6
People.

7
So why are you so dressed up?

8
Oh, Mike's picking me up for a date.

9
Oh, yeah? Now, how's that going?
Is it getting serious?

10
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, you know, I like him.

11
But, you know, am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

12
I'm not quite sure.

13
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

14
It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"Is this moving too fast?

15
Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"

16
Yeah, I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.

17
You're so much better off, you know?
You just go from guy to guy having fun...

18
...and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.

19
I wouldn't say "never."

20
You know, there is that guy.

21
Okay, well, what about?

22
Okay, well, there has gotta be someone.

23
- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
- Oh, my God, you're right!

24
I know. And yet, here you are,
all ready for the next date.

25
I can't believe
I never realized this before.

26
I'm in my 30s, and I've never been
in a long-term relationship.

27
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?

28
No, no, no.

29
Um, there's nothing wrong with you.

30
I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married anyway.

31
I want to get married!

32
No, please...
Please don't cry because of me.

33
Pheebs,
I don't know what I'm talking about, okay?

34
I've been divorced three times.

35
Well, at least you've been married.

36
Oh, my God.
I want to trade lives with Ross?

37
Phoebe.

38
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

39
Mike, this is Ross Geller.
Ross, this is Mike...

40
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.
- Mike Hannigan.

41
- Oh, Ross Geller.
- Hey.

42
- Uh, so are you sure you're ready to go?
- Uh-huh.

43
How do I look?

44
- Do you have a compact in your purse?
- No.

45
You look great.

46
- Hey, Joey.
- This girl won't turn around.

47
I can't tell whether she's hot or not.
What do you think?

48
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.

49
But if her face is as nice as her ass...

50
- Whoo, Mama.
- All right. Thanks.

51
- Hey, have you talked to Chandler?
- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.

52
- How come?
- I don't know. He has to work.

53
There's some big rush on the...

54
Uh...

55
One of these days,
I'm gonna have to start listening...

56
...when he talks about his job.

57
Hey, why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?

58
Maybe I will go.

59
Yeah. We'll have a little second
honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.

60
Oh, and you know what
you should bring?

61
Your black see-through teddy
with the attached garters.

62
- How do you know I have one of those?
- Didn't until just now.

63
Ugh. Hot. Not hot.

64
Hot!

65
Excuse me?

66
Uh, I said that I think you're hot.

67
And, uh, now I'm embarrassed. Heh.

68
Oh, I thought you said "hi."

69
That would've been better.

70
I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.

71
I'm Hayley.

72
Oh. Look, I don't normally ask out women
that I meet in coffeehouses.

73
Ha!

74
Gesundheit.

75
- But...
- I would love to go out with you.

76
Really? Great.

77
Did I...? Did I actually ask you?

78
Oh, um, that's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

79
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?

80
Ha!

81
Seriously, Gunther. You should
see someone about that cold.

82
If it gets much worse, you could die.

83
- So how'd the date go?
- Well, it was awful.

84
Every time I thought about
what you said, I started crying.

85
- So he hasn't called?
- Would you call this girl:

86
"Thanks for a lovely evening"?

87
Now I feel terrible. This is all my fault.

88
You know what
you should feel terrible about?

89
This could have been my serious guy.

90
He was sweet and smart and funny.

91
Do you know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

92
We are a rare breed.

93
What a great dinner.

94
Yeah, and hey, thanks again...

95
...for letting me have that last piece of cake
at the restaurant.

96
Ha, ha. You're welcome again.
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

97
- Can I get you anything?
- Uh, do you have any cake?

98
So this is going pretty good.

99
Dinner was nice.
We've got a lot in common.

100
Ooh, Victoria's Secret. Huh.

101
We even like the same books.

102
Ooh. There's a scary painting.

103
Wait a minute.

104
I think I've been scared
by that painting before.

105
You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.

106
I have definitely been in this apartment.

107
I know I've seen
this weird plant before.

108
Ow! It did that the last time!

109
Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.

110
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

111
And then on that chair, and... No.

112
No, we didn't do it here...

113
...which is weird, because it seems
like a perfectly good place.

114
Ow. That's why.

115
Hey, Mike. Uh, sorry to just drop by
like this. Can I come in?

116
Sure.

117
Who are you?

118
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend
from the coffeehouse?

119
Right, yeah.

120
I really, really need to talk
to you about something.

121
Okay. Unless...

122
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?

123
- No.
- Oh...

124
No, it's just, you know,
you have that look.

125
Damn Supercuts.

126
- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. No.

127
Oh, Phoebe is great. But, um...

128
I'm an idiot, okay?

129
Look, right before you guys went out,
I accidentally got her all upset.

130
Oh. That's why she was weird.

131
Yes, yeah. I said something stupid...

132
...about her never having
had a serious relationship.

133
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.

134
- Please, don't blow her off.
- I'm not gonna blow her off.

135
I actually just got off the phone with her.
We're going out tomorrow night.

136
I mean, I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.

137
Well, then, I didn't need to bother you.

138
Um, you or the four other
Mike Hannigans I bothered.

139
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that true what you said?

140
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

141
Of course she has.

142
If she's never had
a serious relationship...

143
...do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it...

144
...like some kind of unstoppable moron?

145
- But you did say it.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

146
And I will also say...

147
...what I'm about to say...

148
...vis-à-vis...

149
...the following.

150
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship...

151
...since...

152
...her super-serious relationship...

153
...with...

154
...Vikram.

155
- Vikram?
- What? That's a real name.

156
Oklahoma, where the wind comes

157
sweeping down the plain

158
Stop it.

159
Why couldn't they have
sent me to Texas?

160
Seven o'clock.

161
Maybe I'll hit the gym.

162
Ah, who am I kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.

163
- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
- Surprise!

164
- Monica?
- Is everything all right?

165
Yeah, everything's great. I was just, uh...

166
...watching some
regular television there.

167
What a pleasant surprise.

168
- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
- Okay, honey.

169
Ooh. That was close.

170
- Hello.
- Rach, it's me.

171
Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him...

172
...molesting himself.

173
Ugh. That couldn't have been pretty.

174
But you know, guys do that.

175
Uh, well, the weird part is...

176
...he was getting off
to a shark-attack show.

177
- No!
- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!

178
- While watching sharks?
- Yeah.

179
Are you sure that's what he was doing?

180
Do you know how many times
I've seen him jump up like that?

181
Believe me, I know what he was doing.

182
Man. Sharks.

183
I always knew there was something weird
about that dude.

184
You promised to love him
no matter what.

185
"What" means, like, if he gets a disease
or kills someone.

186
- Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
- Oh.

187
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.

188
They like things
that we can't understand.

189
You know, I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend...

190
...that he was an archeologist,
and that I was this...

191
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

192
Ew, are you talking about my brother?

193
Yeah, I didn't disguise that very well, did I?

194
- Hey.
- Hi.

195
Listen to this.
I went out with this girl last night.

196
Halfway through our date I realized...

197
...I already slept with her.

198
You've slept with all the women
in New York...

199
...and now you're going around again?

200
That's not even the weird part.

201
I don't think she remembered
sleeping with me!

202
But you don't remember
sleeping with her.

203
Yeah, but she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!

204
- You guys know.
- How do we know?

205
- We've never slept with you.
- And whose fault is that?

206
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.

207
- Maybe you were having an off night.
- Hey!

208
I never have an off night. Okay?

209
Although, sometimes if I'm a little bloated,
I don't feel that sexy.

210
But even then, I'm better than most.

211
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?

212
Yeah, you're both so slutty,
you don't remember who you slept with.

213
You're made for each other.

214
Interesting. Yeah.

215
All right, well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

216
No salt! Bloaty!

217
- Joey?
- What?

218
You don't think sharks are sexy, do you?

219
No.

220
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?

221
It's open!

222
- Hey.
- Hey. Mike called! We're going out again!

223
- Yay! Yay!
- Yay.

224
- Quick thing. I went to talk to Mike.
- Yeah.

225
What?

226
What did you...? What did you do, Ross?

227
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.

228
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how...

229
How great you are. Ahem, but...

230
Well, you know me. Blah, blah, blah.

231
- And I ended up telling him, um, that...
- What?

232
Um, you had a six-year-long
relationship...

233
...with a guy named Vikram.

234
What? Why?

235
Well, he seemed...

236
...to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.

237
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...

238
...I swear to Lucifer...

239
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now.

240
Phoebe, I think you'll feel differently
when you know...

241
...a little bit about Vikram.

242
Okay, he's, um...

243
He's a kite designer.

244
And he used to date Oprah.

245
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.

246
- I'm just gonna be honest with him.
- Good.

247
Yeah, just be honest with him.

248
- Yeah, I have nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

249
Okay, so, all right,
I haven't been in a relationship...

250
...that lasted longer than a month.

251
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.

252
You know, if he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.

253
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.

254
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

255
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

256
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

257
I'm trying to remember the last time
I opened a door and you weren't there.

258
Phoebe, are you okay?

259
Uh-huh. Yeah. There's just, um...

260
There's something you should know.

261
Vikram just called.

262
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage...

263
...my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest...

264
...because I was the youngest.
- Mm-hm. Sure. Yeah.

265
How can you not remember me?

266
What?

267
How could you not remember
that we slept together?

268
- What? When?
- I don't know.

269
I really, really think
I would remember sleeping with you.

270
Come on, come on.
Search your brain, all right? It was...

271
...a certain amount of time ago.
Okay, I was here. You were here.

272
We had sex here, here, here...

273
Not there.

274
- Anything?
- No, it's not ringing any bells.

275
My God, woman.

276
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?

277
Hey, Hayley.
We really gotta fix that doorknob.

278
Joey?

279
Oh.

280
I slept with you!

281
And you obviously remember me.
Hey, I still got it!

282
So we're good.

283
I'll let myself out.

284
And I said, "Okay, Vikram...

285
...you can't just call
every time you get lonely.

286
- Yeah.
- You know?

287
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."

288
Rachel? I thought she just
had a baby with Ross.

289
Yeah, well...

290
Yeah.

291
You know, but Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller"...

292
...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

293
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

294
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

295
You know, that bastard is one
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

296
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

297
I mean, you know, I'm...
I'm not saying me, but...

298
Maybe me.

299
Oh.

300
And you don't have to worry about
glue-sniffing with me.

301
Although, I do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.

302
Yeah. Uh, anyway, I just...

303
I think I can make you happy.

304
- Okay, I can't do this.
- What's wrong?

305
Well, there is no Vikram.
Ross made him up.

306
Because I...

307
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.

308
I've never lived with a guy.
I've never even celebrated an anniversary.

309
So...

310
You know, if that's too weird for you...

311
...and you want to leave,
I totally understand.

312
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.

313
You kissed me.

314
Uh-huh.

315
- So you don't think I'm a total freak?
- No.

316
Well...

317
Look, can I?

318
Can I think you're a little weird
and also cool...

319
...for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?

320
I guess so.

321
Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me...

322
...and also want to kiss you again?

323
And, um, be a little concerned
about the Magic Markers?

324
Definitely.

325
This is Vikram.

326
Hi, honey, I'm home.

327
Hi.

328
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was great.

329
Why don't you sit down.

330
Get yourself comfortable.

331
Because I have a little...

332
...surprise for you.

333
Well, well, well. It must be 5 in Tulsa...

334
...because it's sex o'clock in N.Y. C!

335
Okay. This is how much I love you.

336
The great white...

337
Honey?

338
Why am I watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?

339
Oh, is this...? Is this not the good part?

340
Do you want me to fast-forward
to something toothier?

341
No, I'm just not sure that you
got the right movie, that's all.

342
Oh. This is the only one
they had at our video store.

343
Though they did have something
called Crocodile Killers.

344
Or does it always have to be sharks?

345
Does what always have to be sharks?

346
Honey, look, we can do something else.

347
Do you want me to
get into the tub and thrash?

348
- What's going on?
- Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

349
I still love you.

350
- Let me be a part of this.
- Let me be a part of this!

351
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.

352
Angry sharks turn you on!

353
No, they don't.

354
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?

355
Oh, my God. When you came in,
I switched the channel.

356
I was just watching regular porn.

357
Really?

358
Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,
American, girl-on-girl action.

359
- Can I tell you how happy that makes me?
- Oh.

360
You are an amazing wife.

361
Really, you are amazing.
You were actually gonna do this for me?

362
I mean, where do you find the strength
and the understanding for that?

363
I'm very, very drunk right now.

364
See, ordinarily, I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.

365
Did I sleep with her?
Did I not sleep with her?

366
You know, maybe this is a wake-up call.

367
You know,
about your whole dating attitude.

368
You're in your 30s and you have
never been in a long-term relationship.

369
Here you go from woman to woman...

370
...meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.

371
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.

372
You're right. I love my life!

373
I actually did sleep with her. Heh.

﻿1
Oh, hey, you guys?

2
I couldn't get a reservation
for the night of my birthday...

3
...so we'll have to do dinner
Thursday night instead.

4
- Thursday? But that's Halloween.
- So?

5
It's just spooky, that's all.

6
Uh, so is Mike coming to dinner?

7
No. It's my first birthday
with a boyfriend, and he has to work.

8
I'd get mad at him, but I think
it's too soon to show my true colors.

9
Well, I would make the reservation
for five.

10
One of us has to stay home
and watch Emma.

11
- Which one of us should go to dinner?
- Oh, Rachel.

12
Uh, actually, I was thinking
maybe both of us could go.

13
Oh, yay.

14
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought
into your gift.

15
All right, so great, we can all go now.

16
That is fun. Hey. You know what?

17
We all haven't been together,
the six of us, in such a long time.

18
What are you talking about?
We're all together now.

19
Uh, Mon? Chandler's not here.

20
Oh, dear God.

21
Hello, everyone. It's nice to see
our team together for the first time.

22
Now, before we get started,
are there any questions?

23
- Yes. Ken, is it?
- That's right.

24
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa
is that you fell asleep in a meeting...

25
...and took the job without realizing
what you were saying yes to?

26
Well, don't believe
everything you hear, Ken.

27
But yeah, that's true.

28
All right, let's get started by, uh,
taking a look at last quarter's figures.

29
Uh, Claudia, aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

30
- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

31
Right now, I can't remember why.

32
You're not allowed to smoke
in this office though, right?

33
Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke
in offices with 15 people or less.

34
- Would you like one?
- All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.

35
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead, it's fine.

36
So you all smoke, then? Heh.

37
You know, it's almost rude
that I'm not smoking.

38
- That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke...
- Ken, please!

39
No, I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

40
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?

41
I've always liked you, Ken.

42
Trick or treat.

43
- Hey.
- Ooh, and "treat" it is.

44
Wow. So glad I changed.

45
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.

46
This is not what I'm wearing.
I'm ovulating...

47
...and Chandler's gonna be home.
So I thought we would try before dinner.

48
Oh. Wait, does that...? You guys won't
be late for my dinner, will you?

49
Chandler and I have not seen each other
in over a week.

50
We'll probably be the first ones there.

51
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

52
Hey. Well, hey.

53
Oh. Wow, somebody smoked out here?

54
My God, don't people know you're
not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

55
Actually, in Oklahoma, smoking is legal
in offices with fewer than 15 people.

56
Oh, you smoked.

57
No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia
about smoking in different states.

58
For example, in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.

59
- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
- Do you think Monica is gonna smell it?

60
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bloodhound.

61
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.

62
Pheebs?

63
I'm gonna go.

64
Okay. Something to cover the smell.

65
Oven cleaner.

66
Unscented.

67
Welcome home.

68
I've missed you.

69
- You wanna join me in the bedroom?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

70
Oh, okay. So you want to play it
that way, do you?

71
Well, uh, you know what?
Actually, I just got off a plane...

72
...so I'm feeling gross.
Maybe I should take a shower.

73
- Come here, you don't need a shower.
- All right, the truth is...

74
...I soiled myself
during some turbulence.

75
What do I smell? I smell smoke.

76
Did you smoke?

77
Yes. But I just had one.

78
Two.

79
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.

80
A pack. Two pack... A carton.

81
Three big fat cartons in two days.

82
But it's over. I've made a decision,
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.

83
Well, those are for you.

84
All right. Well, we'll just, uh,
see you when you get here. Bye.

85
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terrible traffic.

86
Okay, well, that is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.

87
- What are the other two?
- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.

88
And second one, I'm not going.

89
I know this is the first time
we're leaving the baby.

90
Hey, I know how hard it is for you. But...

91
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.

92
- She's great with kids.
- She is?

93
Yeah.

94
What about Monica?

95
Hey, you only hear Monica's side of that.
Okay, that little fatso was a terror.

96
- I just don't think I can do it.
- You know what? You can and you should.

97
Really, it'll be good for you.

98
In fact, you know what?

99
Why don't you go ahead to the restaurant,
and I will wait for my mom...

100
...and then I'll meet you there?
No, no, really, you should go. Go out.

101
Really, the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red.

102
- You need to learn some new slang.
- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.

103
Here. No, just go.

104
- Well... Oh!
- No, no. You know what?

105
You're not getting back in there.
The baby's fine. Now, scram.

106
Yeah, tell your story walking.

107
I was just going to say
that I left my keys.

108
Oh.

109
Holy moley, are we in a pickle now.

110
Where is everyone?
They're 40 minutes late.

111
- I know.
- I'm starving.

112
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.

113
What about me?
I only had one lunch today.

114
So are we expecting
the rest of our party shortly?

115
Yes, they are expected presently.
Yeah.

116
Their, um... Their arrival is in the offing.

117
Right. We do have
a table for two available.

118
- Perhaps you'd be...
- No, they're coming.

119
We're waiting right here.

120
Joseph.

121
One needn't worry. They shan't be long.

122
It's just that we do have
some large parties waiting.

123
Oh, one really does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?

124
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad? Huh?

125
Where the little kid walks
through Grandpa? It's chilling.

126
I messed up. It was a meeting.
Everybody was smoking.

127
So what? Don't you have any willpower?

128
Willpower? I've watched home movies
of you eating Ding Dongs...

129
...without taking the tinfoil off.

130
You said that was sexy.

131
Okay, look, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.

132
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.

133
- You forbid me?
- Mm-hm.

134
You know, I've flown a long way
to see my loving wife.

135
Is she here, by the way?

136
Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very, very upset right now.

137
Oh. Would you say this is the most upset
you could be?

138
I think so.

139
Well, then I might as well...

140
...do this.

141
Not really sure what to do now.

142
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

143
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.

144
So you're going to put out
that cigarette...

145
...we're gonna put this fight on hold,
and go have sex.

146
Fine. What?

147
Sex. This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it...

148
...we're gonna have to wait
until next month.

149
You're serious?

150
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.

151
- And no cuddling.
- And no kissing your neck.

152
Oh, good. I hate it when you do that.

153
And lots of kissing your neck.

154
Okay, well, the super's not home.

155
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.

156
I can't wait that long. You have to do
something. Knock that door down.

157
I would, but I bruise like a peach.

158
Besides, you know, everything's
gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.

159
- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
- Can't hold her own head up.

160
But, yeah, jumped.

161
Oh, my God.
I left the water running.

162
You did not leave the water running.
Please, pull yourself together, okay?

163
- Well, did I leave the stove on?
- You haven't cooked since 1996.

164
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird could fly in and...

165
Oh, my God, you know what?
I think you're right.

166
- Listen.
- What? What?

167
A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.
An eagle flew in.

168
Landed on the stove and caught fire.

169
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.

170
The eagle, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...

171
...and grabs the baby in its talon.

172
Meanwhile, the faucet
fills the apartment with water.

173
Baby and bird, still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip...

174
...swirling around the whirlpool
that fills the apartment.

175
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.

176
- Hello.
- Hi.

177
It's been an hour.

178
The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider
switching to a smaller table.

179
Maybe we should just eat now.

180
You can't order until the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant policy.

181
Well, how about this?
Another table leaves, right...

182
...but there's still some food left
on their plates.

183
Okay, what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?

184
- It's frowned upon.
- But it happens.

185
- All right, I gotta go to the bathroom.
- No, you can't go.

186
No, no, no.
I can't hold this table on my own.

187
If they ask me to move, I'll cave.

188
Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.

189
Good evening, miss.

190
Miss?

191
Miss? Miss?

192
Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.
You don't have to manhandle me.

193
Where? Okay.

194
Thank you.

195
Wow.

196
Finally, you guys made it.

197
Pheebs, who the hell...? Ah!

198
Spend more time with the tie.
That'll make a baby.

199
Look, I can't do this. I can't make love
to you while we're fighting this way.

200
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.

201
But when you wanted to have sex
right after my uncle's funeral...

202
That was a celebration of life.

203
All right, look, I'm not gonna do this.

204
Is this the way you want our baby
to be conceived?

205
No, you're right.

206
Yeah, we shouldn't do it like this.

207
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

208
I shouldn't have come down on you
so hard about the smoking.

209
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.

210
- Really?
- Yeah.

211
You are incredible.

212
And listen,
I'm not gonna smoke again.

213
And if I do, I promise
I will hide it so much better from you.

214
- Do you want to?
- Yeah, let's celebrate life.

215
Okay.

216
Oh, God.

217
Oh, thank God you're okay.

218
I'm sorry we left you.
Mommy will never leave you again.

219
Never, ever, ever again.

220
Great. So let's get going.

221
Oh, no. I mean it. After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.

222
I understand. Separation is hard.

223
One time I was about to leave Ross
to go to the beauty parlor.

224
And he got so upset
he took off all his clothes...

225
...tucked his willy between his legs...

226
...and cried out,
"Mommy, I'm a girl. Take me with you."

227
Somehow, over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.

228
Ah.

229
You are welcome.

230
- You know what? Let's not talk.
- What?

231
- I am still so mad at you for smoking.
- But you said you forgave me.

232
It was just a couple of cigarettes,
no big deal.

233
Oh, blah-blah-blah-blah.

234
I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't
have sex with me if we were fighting.

235
- You tricked me to get me into bed?
- That's right. I got mine.

236
I feel so used.

237
Well, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?

238
Thank you.

239
Waiter? All right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.

240
Risotto with shaved truffles
and the rib steak...

241
...with the golden chanterelles
and the Bordelaise sauce...

242
...unless any of that stuff I just said
means "snails."

243
- It does not.
- Tomato tart...

244
...and, um, which of the pastas
would you recommend?

245
- Oh, well, they're both exquis...
- Both it is. Thank you.

246
Oh, uh, can I make a special request?

247
Can you bring everything
as soon as it's ready?

248
Appetizers, entrées, we don't care.

249
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

250
- I'll just wait to put your order in.
- You guys are over an hour late.

251
- What happened to you two?
- So sorry.

252
- We got locked out of the apartment.
- That's a great story. Can I eat it?

253
And then Rachel wasn't sure
she could leave the baby.

254
It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.

255
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?

256
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...

257
...how she's doing at home, and I'm
gonna be completely here with you.

258
- Oh, she spit up.
- What?

259
She spit up. Judy? She spit...
Judy, look alive, Judy.

260
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

261
- Ooh.
- Whew, everything looks delicious.

262
What should I have?
What should I have?

263
Never hit a woman.
Never hit a woman.

264
I know what you mean,
this looks incredible.

265
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.

266
Okay, I'll have the fig salad
and the duck.

267
I'll have the, uh, soup and the salmon.

268
Remember, whatever comes up first,
okay?

269
- And hurry...
- Happy birthday.

270
Son of a bitch.

271
- Where have you been?
- Well, we had a little fight.

272
I would never lie
to get someone into bed.

273
You used to tell girls
you were a Kennedy.

274
Thanks.

275
Thanks. Wow.

276
A little tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?

277
You had a big table
but they made you move.

278
Ha, ha. Shut up, Monica.

279
Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler
will have the smoked duck.

280
And I suppose that Monica
will have the manipulative shrew.

281
- I'll give you another minute.
- What, where you going?

282
He said she wanted the shrew.

283
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.

284
You're turning into an obsessive mother,
okay? You need to stop.

285
You guys ever hear the story about
when Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?

286
- You mean the willy story?
- Ha, ha. They already know it.

287
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

288
- Maybe you should order.
- That's okay.

289
- I told the waiter what they want.
- Why would you do that?

290
Chandler, control your woman.

291
Okay, well...
Everybody has ordered.

292
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.

293
- She dropped her sock.
- Aw. What?

294
- No. No, Emma dropped her sock.
- Mom's here?

295
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.

296
Ross, she still has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.

297
It's a good toast.

298
Look, will you please get her attention?

299
Mommy?

300
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
pick up the sock.

301
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!

302
I'm sorry, was that rude?

303
Did my little outburst...

304
...blunt the hideousness
that is this evening?

305
Look, I know you all
have a lot going on...

306
...but all I wanted to do was have dinner
with my friends on my birthday.

307
And you are all so late, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to call.

308
Well, it's too late now.

309
Yeah, Pheebs, I don't think that's us.

310
Oh, well, this is... This is not over.
Hello?

311
- What is going on with you two?
- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.

312
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.

313
But maybe you're not ovulating at all.
Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

314
Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.

315
You're not gonna believe this. She lied.

316
She tricked me into having sex with her.

317
So? You got to have sex, right?

318
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girl?

319
- Okay. That was Mike.
- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.

320
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent...

321
...and we love you, and we are ready
to start your birthday celebration.

322
Oh. You guys,
that means the world to me.

323
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

324
What?

325
Oh, I love you guys too,
but Mike got off work early.

326
Wait.

327
Wait. I'm not the... I'm not the kind of girl
that just ditches her friends...

328
...to be with her boyfriend.

329
You know what? I am.

330
Bye, guys. Judy. Bye.

331
Oh, thank God. If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?

332
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.

333
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

334
See you. Well, I guess it's just us.

335
So I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you wanna give it another try?

336
So you've never had sex
with a Kennedy, have you?

337
- You're gonna go do it?
- We don't have much time.

338
Once the egg descends into the
fallopian tube...

339
Whoa, whoa, get out of here.

340
I sincerely hope the rest of your party
is returning.

341
No, just me. All alone.

342
Dinner for six for one.

343
Well, you boys are about
to see something really special.

344
- How was everything, sir?
- Excellent.

345
The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.

346
Well, I hope you've got some room left.

347
Happy birthday to you

348
Happy birthday to you

349
Happy birthday, dear

350
Joey. Joey.

351
Joey

352
Happy birthday to you

353
This is the best birthday ever.

﻿1
Hello.

2
Hello.

3
I love my new job!

4
- Honey, you're screaming.
- You bet your ass I am.

5
I just had the best first day ever.

6
The kitchen?
Twice as big as Allessandro's.

7
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

8
And clean? Not just Health
Department-clean, Monica-clean.

9
Awesome.

10
Oh, and the people are so nice.

11
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maître d'.

12
Chandler, you will love him.

13
He is without a doubt
the funniest guy I have ever met.

14
- This is nice.
- I know.

15
- You need both hands for that?
- Yeah, I kind of do.

16
Well, how's this?

17
Oh, look at you two holding hands.

18
Is this getting serious?

19
Well, I, you know...

20
Have you not talked about it yet?

21
Am I making you uncomfortable?

22
If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh?

23
I'm sorry, heh.

24
It's obviously way too early
for us to be having that conversation.

25
- Is it?
- Maybe not. Is it?

26
Okay, when I got divorced...

27
...I didn't think I'd feel this way about
someone for a really long time.

28
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone like you.

29
And this may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.

30
- No, not... That's gum.
- Oh.

31
Oh, five bucks.
I love it when that happens, you know?

32
- You don't know it's there...
- I know. Keep digging.

33
Oh, sorry.

34
Oh. It's a key.

35
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five dollars.

36
- It's to my apartment.
- Oh, wow.

37
Ooh. Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

38
Look, I don't want you to feel like
you have to give me your key...

39
- No, I want to.
- Oh, thank God.

40
Yeah.

41
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that...

42
...you know, I wanted to do this with.

43
Here you go.

44
- This is cool, huh?
- It really is.

45
Oh, I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors.

46
So I don't go back to work
for another four weeks...

47
...but we would like our nanny
to start right away...

48
...so that Emma could get
a chance to know her.

49
I think that's really smart.

50
The easier we can make
the transition for her the better.

51
That's great. Great.

52
- So do you have any questions for us?
- Not really.

53
All right. Well, thank you
so much for coming.

54
- Thank you.
- It was really nice to meet you.

55
- We will call you.
- Oh, you know, wait.

56
- I do have one question.
- Yeah.

57
Do you guys do random drug testing?

58
Boy, we, uh,
hadn't really thought of that.

59
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.

60
Okey-dokey.

61
Wow. We're never gonna find a nanny.

62
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.

63
And worse comes to worst, we can always
reconsider the, uh, first one we met with.

64
- What, the blond with no bra?
- She was blond?

65
Just a sec.

66
- Okay, this one's name is Sandy.
- Okay.

67
She's got a degree in
Early Childhood Education.

68
Uh, she worked for her last family
for three years.

69
Okay.

70
Hi. I'm Sandy.

71
And she's a little mannish.

72
- Ah! Oh, my God. David.
- Hi.

73
- Uh, is this a bad time?
- No, it's a great time. Come in.

74
Wow. Hi.

75
Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?

76
Well, just for a couple of days.

77
I'm here to explain to the people
who gave us our grant...

78
...why it's a positive thing that
we've spent all their money...

79
...and, uh, accomplished, uh, nothing.

80
Who cares? It got you here.

81
Well, it got me to New York anyway.
Then I got in a cab at the airport...

82
...and the guy said, "Where to?"

83
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.

84
Wow. Where's your luggage?

85
Damn it.

86
All right, I'll call the cab company.

87
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?

88
Boy.

89
There's an old Russian expression, um,
that goes:

90
Roughly translated, that means, um:

91
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

92
Thank you.

93
Uh, no, you should see me when...
Actually, no, I look pretty good.

94
Are you kidding?

95
You know, when you don't see
someone for a long time...

96
...and you kind of build them up
in your head, you start thinking:

97
"Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."

98
But, well, you are.

99
Well, so, um, are you seeing anyone?

100
No.

101
I'm just the worst person ever.

102
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?

103
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

104
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"
And I said, "No."

105
- Oh, well, that would've been your window.
- Yeah.

106
I mean, I don't know.
I was looking in his eyes...

107
...and I was just thinking,
"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

108
He's just so irresistible.

109
- Really? The scientist guy?
- Really? Chandler?

110
Continue.

111
Okay, then it gets worse...

112
...because I told him
I would see him tomorrow night.

113
- Phoebe.
- I know. Evil.

114
And, and, and, and...

115
I like Mike so much, you know?
It's just going really well. Oh, my God.

116
Wow, isn't it ironic that David
would show up...

117
...on the same day that
you and Mike exchange keys?

118
Uh-huh.

119
Yeah. You know, and given
my lifelong search for irony...

120
...you can imagine how happy I am.

121
- What are you gonna do?
- I mean, I guess I just have to...

122
...tell David that nothing
can happen between us.

123
Unless I don't.

124
You know, complicated moral situation?

125
- No right, no wrong?
- You have to tell David.

126
I knew I should've had this conversation
with Joey.

127
Funniest guy she's ever met.

128
I'm funny, right?

129
What do you know? You're a door.

130
You just like knock-knock jokes.

131
Save it for inside.

132
- Hey.
- Hey.

133
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,
they call it the Sooner State.

134
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state.

135
And what's with Oklahoma
having a panhandle?

136
Can all states have stuff like that?

137
Hey, yeah, I'm from the, uh,
waistband of Wyoming.

138
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.

139
Was your cabin pressurized?

140
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.

141
Okay.

142
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,
just two words just pushed together?

143
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so, I say why stop there?

144
You know, your new poodle
could be your noodle.

145
And fried chicken could be fricken.

146
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'll have the fricken.

147
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

148
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.

149
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
right?

150
Yeah, he came up.

151
Well, he did this bit.
You probably had to be there...

152
...but it was Liza Minnelli locked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.

153
Oh, ha, ha.

154
- Were you there?
- No, but it sounds fricken funny.

155
I really understand how hard it's gotta be
to leave your child with another person.

156
I mean, it's like leaving behind
a piece of your heart.

157
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

158
- Are you gay?
- Ross.

159
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

160
- But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.
- Oh.

161
- Her name's Delia.
- That's pretty.

162
So you're just, like,
a guy who's a nanny.

163
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox
for some people.

164
But I really believe the most satisfying
thing you can do with your life...

165
...is take care of a child.

166
Okay.

167
Like at my last job.

168
I met Daniel when he was
3 weeks old.

169
And I got to watch him grow
into this awesome person.

170
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

171
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

172
- That was his name for me.
- Oh, ha, ha.

173
"I'll see you every day right in..."

174
- It's okay.
- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

175
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.

176
- I can take care of that, if you want.
- Oh, that would be great.

177
I love him, I love him, I love him.

178
Oh, come on. Rach, he's a guy.

179
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

180
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't try him out.

181
Because it's weird.

182
Why?

183
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?

184
I mean, it's like if a woman
wanted to be...

185
Yes?

186
King?

187
I, uh, hope you don't mind. I used
some of my homemade lotion on Emma.

188
It's a mixture of calendula and
honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

189
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

190
Yes. Sandy, you're hired.

191
That's great.

192
I'm sorry.

193
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.

194
Oh, God. Come here.

195
You gotta be at least bi.

196
Hey.

197
I need you to set me up for a joke.

198
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.

199
Ooh, I don't know, Chandler.
I'm not so good with remembering lines.

200
Well, thank God your livelihood
doesn't depend on it.

201
I know, right?

202
Why are we doing this?

203
Monica says that her maître d'
is the funniest guy she's ever met.

204
- Seriously? She actually said that?
- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

205
- No. Being funny's your thing.
- Yeah.

206
Without that, you just got
"lame with women."

207
Hi. There you are.

208
Fire trucks.

209
Wow. You look even more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

210
- Ooh.
- In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

211
- Oh, wait, wait.
- Yeah, I can't get away with stuff like that.

212
It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

213
No, no, it's not that.

214
Remember when you asked me
if I was seeing someone and I said no?

215
- Well, um, I am. His name's Mike.
- Oh. Oh.

216
- I should've told you.
- No.

217
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

218
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Well, it's okay. I understand.

219
Well, are you happy with this guy?

220
- I am happy.
- Damn it.

221
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.

222
But only with me. No, that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.

223
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry. Um...

224
- I think I should probably, uh, go.
- Well...

225
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know...

226
...telling you this is one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.

227
Well, just so you know...

228
...hearing it wasn't exactly
a Vladnik carnival, either.

229
- Can we at least hug goodbye?
- Of course. Yeah.

230
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.

231
- No. No.
- I mean...

232
- In Minsk?
- Yeah?

233
- It's, um, two on each cheek...
- Mm-hm.

234
...and, uh, one on the lips.
- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...

235
In New York, it's...

236
Oh, boy.

237
Hi.

238
Is everything all right?

239
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

240
Sandy was just telling me about how he
proposed to his fiancée...

241
...and it was so beautiful.

242
Well, her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem...

243
I can't hear it again.

244
You know, I can't tell it again.

245
And I'm fine never having heard it.

246
- Rach, can I see you for a sec?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

247
Do you realize that man has cried
in our apartment three times? Huh?

248
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in.

249
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.

250
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.

251
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

252
No, I mean, all I'm saying is that guy...
These are amazing.

253
Sandy made madeleines.

254
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

255
What kind of a guy makes delicate
French cookies? Huh?

256
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with...

257
You know, with chunks.

258
Well, you know,
I don't know what to say.

259
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.

260
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you
just came in from branding cattle.

261
Hey, there's sensitive
and there's too sensitive.

262
Okay, what is too sensitive?

263
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

264
- But it's nice. And nice is good.
- Mm-hm.

265
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.

266
- No, no. No.
- But...

267
Ergo.

268
Look, David, if you had never left, then...

269
...yeah, we'd probably still be together
right now.

270
But you did leave. And I'm with Mike,
and I really care about him.

271
Well, um, goodbye. Uh...

272
Well, the key works.

273
And, you, thanks for the face massage.
Thank you.

274
Did Rachel tell you we hired
a male nanny?

275
- Yeah. I think that's great.
- Oh, really?

276
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

277
- Oh. How are they?
- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

278
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

280
Really?

281
Guys do that?

282
- That's weird.
- Thank you.

283
- That's like a woman wanting to be a...
- What?

284
- What's the end of that sentence?
- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

285
Uh...

286
A penis model.

287
Anyway, hey, did you tell Chandler
that some guy from work...

288
...is the funniest guy you ever met?

289
- Yeah. So?
- Wow.

290
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

291
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?

292
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

293
- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
- So what?

294
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
You know, like Ross' thing is...

295
Science?

296
- Academia? Being a good father?
- No.

297
- I can't believe he's that upset about this.
- You have to do some damage control.

298
Because he's feeling like...

299
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

300
- What are you guys talking about?
- Uh, ahem.

301
Rachel and I, uh, hired a male nanny.

302
You got a man who's a nanny?

303
You got a "manny"?

304
You know, I don't mind a male nanny...

305
...but I do draw the line
at male wet nurse.

306
Oh! Oh! You are on a roll, mister.

307
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.

308
Okay. Okay. Stop it, you.
You stop it.

309
What is so funny about that?

310
I don't know, it's...
Well, just the way you say it.

311
I mean, you're funny. You have
that funny thing. You're a funny guy.

312
Did you tell her what we talked about?

313
Yeah.

314
So those were pity laughs?
Pity laughs?

315
Honey, listen.

316
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.

317
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

318
Well, you're different funny.

319
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

320
And, well, he does bits and impressions
and limericks.

321
I do limericks.

322
Uh, there once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.

323
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

324
You know that joke
you told me last week?

325
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye?

326
That slayed me.

327
Hey. I made up that joke
and told it to you.

328
- Not knowing when to shut up.
- Yep, that's my thing.

329
Yup.

330
So how many guys have your key?

331
No, no, no. It's not as bad as it looks.

332
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

333
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

334
Oh, uh, we just, uh,
happen to wear the same shade.

335
No, um, David and I did used to go out.

336
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.

337
- Did you, uh...?
- No. No.

338
- Kiss him?
- Oh, well, yeah.

339
Yes, but you should know,
she really likes you.

340
In fact, I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are, fella.

341
- Don't point your finger at me.
- Why?

342
What are you gonna do about it?

343
Well, I'll show you
what I'm gonna do about it.

344
- Oh, really? Really?
- You want some of that? Huh? Huh?

345
Stop it. Stop it.
Before someone gets really hurt.

346
Here, David, you should just go.

347
All right.

348
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,
well, you just better watch out.

349
- If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
- Oh, you're going to Minsk?

350
- Well, I might.
- Really?

351
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.

352
- Okay, well, guys?
- Well...

353
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

354
- Hey, what, are you kidding me?
- Right-o. Right-o.

355
Take good care of her.

356
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

357
If you want your key back,
I totally understand.

358
- It's never gonna happen again, right?
- Right. Never. I swear.

359
I... Oh, I just want to say, if you do ever
come to Minsk, that's my number.

360
We'll, uh, party up Vladnik-style.

361
Yeah. All right.

362
Hey, Ross. Check it out.
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns."

363
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

364
- No, "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
- I swear to God.

365
- Who's up for puppets?
- Me. I'm up for puppets.

366
Well, please welcome:

367
The Snufflebumps.

368
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch
and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

369
Okay, okay, how exactly is a 2-month-old
supposed to appreciate puppets?

370
Studies show that the movement and
colors help their cerebral development.

371
The whimsical characters are just for us.

372
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch.

373
Oh, my God.

374
Well, I guess we know
who's gonna be the Grumpus.

375
- That was kind of rude.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

376
Please apologize to Sandy
and the Snufflebumps for me.

377
- You know, he was just doing his job.
- You know what?

378
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't
in love with Gary Poppins out there.

379
But I just... I can't go through with this.

380
- Come on.
- No. You know what?

381
I would never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortable with.

382
Ugh, that's true.

383
Thank you.

384
You want to fire him,
so you're gonna have to go do it.

385
So you see, Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.

386
I am learning so much from you.

387
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

388
So if your maître d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes...

389
...tell him to e-mail me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com.

390
Honey, you can relax.

391
Last night at work
Jeffrey told this really sexist joke.

392
- After that, not so funny anymore.
- Really?

393
See, that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart, people.

394
Okay. Don't miss that flight.
You know I love you.

395
I love you too.

396
- And I like you as a friend.
- Right.

397
- See you later.
- See you.

398
- Did the guy really make that joke?
- No, he still kills me.

399
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear, a little pee came out.

400
Here goes.

401
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

402
Sandy? Hi.

403
- Hi.
- We, uh...

404
We kind of need to talk.

405
I'm afraid it's not working out.

406
- Oh.
- Yeah, um...

407
I mean, Rachel and I think
you are great with Emma. Um...

408
- We just feel...
- You. You feel.

409
I just feel...

410
...that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.

411
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.

412
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers
from other families.

413
I just picked you guys because...

414
- ...I liked you the best.
- Oh, damn you, Geller.

415
Anyway, uh, well, I'm glad
there's no hard feelings.

416
No, none at all. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.

417
Although, if you don't mind telling me...

418
...what was the problem? Maybe it's
something I can work on in the future.

419
No, you know, it's, uh, nothing you did.
It's... It's, uh, my issue.

420
What is it?

421
Uh, heh...

422
Please?

423
You know, I'm just not, um,
that comfortable...

424
...with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

425
That's fair.

426
Although, can I ask,
why do you think that is?

427
Why? I don't know.

428
Um... Uh...

429
Maybe because of my father?

430
Mm.

431
I mean, uh, you know, when I was
growing up, he was a tough guy.

432
You know, and as a kid,
I wasn't the athlete I am now.

433
I play squash.

434
Anyway, I, uh... I always got the feeling
he thought I was too sensitive.

435
That must have been hard.

436
It was hard.

437
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs...

438
Playing and learning.

439
And my father walks in and says,
"What are you doing with those things?

440
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you
outside playing like a real boy?"

441
- But you are a real boy.
- I know I am.

442
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?

443
It's all right. Crying is good.
It lets the boo-hoos out.

444
Here comes some more.

445
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?

446
- What kind?
- A friend ship.

447
Wow. You blow my mind.

448
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Aw.

449
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty bucks.

450
It's like the cheapest college ever.

﻿1
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...

2
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

3
Yes, we were. Heh.
Come here, gorgeous.

4
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

5
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got...

6
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

7
Yes, you do. And a...
And a big, round belly.

8
Big baby butt.

9
I like big butts.

10
I like big butts and I cannot lie

11
You other brothers can't deny

12
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

13
And a round thing in your face
You get...

14
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

15
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

16
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

17
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

18
What? What?
You wanna hear some more? Um...

19
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

20
I'm a terrible father. Oh.

21
- Hey.
- Hey, listen.

22
- What do you know about investments?
- How come?

23
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

24
- What do you do with your money now?
- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

25
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

26
- Do you have any ideas?
- Uh, this guy at work got me excited...

27
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

28
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

29
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

30
Yeah. Right!

31
People eat birds. Bird meat.

32
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

33
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird." Ha-ha-ha.

34
Or maybe just a wing. Or a...

35
Mm-hm.
- Ahem.

36
You should consider something
a little less risky.

37
I think real estate is
your best investment.

38
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

39
That's right. I know some stuff.

40
Real estate, huh? Hmm.

41
Oh! And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

42
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

43
My dad told me.
They play golf together.

44
Oh! Well, maybe
I'll join them sometime.

45
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...

46
...and beat the mustache
off his face.

47
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

48
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
Big step.

49
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

50
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

51
- Oh, yeah, she can't be herself.
- Ugh.

52
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

53
- You can say neither.
- Oh, God. Neither.

54
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

55
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

56
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

57
Uh-huh.

58
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

59
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
- Oh, he took the SATs for me.

60
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!
- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...

61
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

62
Oh! Well, with the mother...

63
...just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

64
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...

65
...I am like the daughter
that she never had.

66
- She said what?
- She's like the daughter she never had.

67
Listen.

68
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

70
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

71
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

72
You what? And I missed it...

73
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?

74
Yeah, and it was, uh, like, uh,
a real little person laugh too.

75
- Oh!
- It was like, um:

76
Only not creepy.

77
Yeah.

78
- What did you do to make her laugh?
- I, um...

79
Well, I sang. Actually...

80
...I rapped, um, heh...

81
..."Baby Got Back."

82
You what?

83
You sang to our baby daughter...

84
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...

85
...with women with giant asses?

86
You know what,
if you think about it...

87
...it actually promotes
a healthy, uh, body image...

88
...because even big butts...

89
...or, uh, "juicy doubles" are...
- Oh.

90
Please don't take her away from me.

91
Oh, hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

92
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

93
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

94
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

95
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park...

96
That's enough out of you.

97
Uh, is there anything we should know
about the place?

98
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

99
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

100
- Ha. No, no, no.
- Ha-ha-ha.

101
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

102
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- That's all right.

103
Wow, you, uh, seemed
pretty insulted by that.

104
What, I'm not good enough for you?

105
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

106
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

107
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

108
When we know
all he does is sit around...

109
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man. Ha, ha.

110
- You don't think he's here, do you?
- I don't know.

111
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

112
Well, let me see.

113
Yeah, I can see it.

114
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

115
Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Cool Hand Luke.

116
- Oh, my God.
- What?

117
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

118
Ooh. A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

119
Wait a minute.

120
This says "Monica."

121
And this is Richard's apartment.

122
Get there faster!

123
Wow. You look...

124
...like my mom.

125
I'm wearing pantyhose.

126
- Great! Come on in.
- Okay.

127
- Ha-ha-ha. Hi.
- Hi.

128
Oh. Thank you.

129
Oh. Heh.

130
- Oh, my God. You're rich.
- No, my parents are rich.

131
So? They gotta die someday. Hello!

132
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

133
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

134
Theodore, Bitsy...

135
...what a delight.
Ha-ha-ha.

136
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- And you.

137
Your home is lovely.

138
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

139
Holy crap!

140
Oh. Why don't you come
meet our friends?

141
Try and stop me.

142
Hey. What are you doing?

143
Getting your parents to like me.

144
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

145
I want them
to get to know Phoebe, not:

146
"Phoebe."

147
- You've got it.
- All right.

148
- It's hard to stop.
- Mm.

149
Well, come on.

150
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

151
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

152
Mm-hm.

153
- So where are you from?
- Um, okay.

154
Well, all right.
Um, originally, I'm from upstate...

155
...but, um, then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

156
So I moved to the city...

157
...where, um, I lived in a burned-out
Buick LeSabre for a while.

158
Which was okay. That was okay.

159
Until, um, I got hepatitis, you know...

160
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and...

161
But I got over it.

162
And, um, anyway, now I'm a, um,
freelance massage therapist...

163
...um, which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

164
So where does everyone summer?

165
- Oh, God, this is not going well.
- No, you're doing fine. Really.

166
- Why don't you go talk to my dad?
- Okay, okay, okay.

167
- Still sure about me being myself?
- Absolutely.

168
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

169
Okay.

170
So, Theodore, I, uh, can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

171
Oh. Well...

172
- You must work out all the time.
- Oh, not all the time. I do the best I can.

173
- Yeah, I bet. Look out!
- Oh! Ow.

174
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Unh! I recently had surgery.

175
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll be fine.

176
- I just should check the stitches.
- I really am sorry.

177
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

178
Um...

179
Did you just hit my dad?

180
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

181
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

182
Why don't you go talk to my mom?

183
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

184
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

185
Oh, Bitsy? Um, uh, listen,
I wanted to thank you again...

186
...for having me here tonight.

187
Well, not at all.

188
Also, um, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

189
- Thank you. I think so too.
- It's a testament to how he was raised.

190
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

191
- Is he really?
- He is so considerate of my feelings.

192
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

193
Excuse me?

194
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

195
When he gets going...

196
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

197
That's... my boy.

198
Awesome.

199
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

200
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

201
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

202
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

203
Did you take that tape?

204
I had to! Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...

205
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

206
I don't know. Who am I married to?

207
Some girl.

208
She hot?

209
- Yeah.
- How did she get me to settle down?

210
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

211
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

212
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

213
Ha, ha. Can it?

214
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...

215
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

216
- Then you have to watch it for me.
- Whoa! What?

217
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

218
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

219
- Why am I hearing cheering?
- It's okay. It's just a football game.

220
- It's just football?
- You were all worried for nothing.

221
It's football! It's just football!

222
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

223
I think it may be customary
to get a beer!

224
What the?

225
- What are you doing?
- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

226
What are you guys doing?

227
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

228
Okay, uh, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

229
Please laugh for Mommy.

230
Not funny, huh?

231
Well, so is it...

232
...only offensive novelty rap?

233
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

234
My name is Mommy

235
And I'm here to say

236
That all the babies are...

237
Oh, I can't rap.

238
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

239
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

240
I like

241
Big butts and I cannot lie

242
You other brothers can't deny

243
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

244
And a round thing in your face

245
Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Ha!

246
Oh.

247
I like big butts and I cannot lie

248
You other brothers can't deny

249
Oh, Emma, you're laughing!
Oh, you are!

250
You really do like big butts, don't you?

251
Oh, you beautiful little weirdo.

252
Oh.

253
- Hey.
- Oh, you missed it! She was laughing!

254
- Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh.

255
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

256
Oh, I know, isn't it?

257
Oh, what did you do
to get her to laugh?

258
Oh, you know, I just...
A couple of things I tried. Different...

259
Just sang a little
"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

260
You sang "Baby Got Back,"
didn't you?

261
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

262
And then it goes back to the chorus.

263
Smelly cat, smelly cat

264
It's not your fault

265
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

266
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...

267
...but, um, no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

268
Uh, Phoebe writes lots of songs. What
was that one you sang the other night?

269
Oh, "Pervert Parade"?

270
No.

271
- Oh! "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
- Stop.

272
Oh, God. Is that veal?

273
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

274
Oh.

275
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...

276
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love. Heh.

277
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

278
But, you know, especially veal.

279
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

280
- Mm. Yummy.
Ha-ha-ha.

281
So...

282
What do you think?

283
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

284
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

285
That tape was never meant
to be seen by...

286
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

287
Ha, ha, Monica, look, I don't think
you and I have any secrets anymore.

288
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

289
Why in the world would you take
this tape? And why would you watch it?

290
Because that's who I am. Okay?

291
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

292
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

293
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

294
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

295
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

296
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

297
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

298
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

299
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard, he...

300
I can grow a mustache.

301
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

302
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...

303
...cowboy boots in the air.

304
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

305
Oh, good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

306
- That's not me!
- What?

307
That's not you! Life is good again!

308
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

309
That bastard taped over me!

310
Is that a problem?

311
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

312
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

313
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

314
- Hello, dear.
- Hey.

315
- What's going on?
- We were just chitchatting.

316
- How's your friend?
- A little better.

317
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

318
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

319
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, please, darling, let's be honest.

320
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

321
- But let's be real.
- All right, stop.

322
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...

323
...but she did her best.

324
- She's a little different than you are.
- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

325
So what? If I can
get past that, it shouldn't bother you.

326
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

327
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love...

328
- The woman you what?
- Yeah, the woman you what?

329
The woman I love.

330
I love you.

331
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...

332
...and Tom and Sue.

333
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

334
- I love you too.
- You do?

335
Yeah. Ha, ha.

336
How great is this?

337
- Wanna get out of here?
- Okay.

338
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
- I had a great time.

339
It was really top-drawer.

340
And here's something rich.

341
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

342
Ta-ta!

343
She's sweat, wet

344
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette

345
- So, fellas!
- Yeah?

346
- Fellas!
- Yeah?

347
- Has your girlfriend got the butt?
- Hell, yeah

348
- So shake it
- Shake it

349
- Shake it
- Shake it

350
Shake that nasty butt

351
Baby got back

352
One more time from the top!

353
I like big butts
And I cannot lie

354
You other brothers...

355
Rachel, please!
That is so inappropriate!

﻿1
Hey, hon? Would you help me
get the plates down?

2
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
we use our wedding china today?

3
No, I think we should save our china
for something really special.

4
Like if the queen of England
comes over.

5
Honey, she keeps
canceling on us. Take the hint.

6
What if something breaks?
They're expensive.

7
What is the point of having them
if we never use them?

8
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over...

9
- I will explain it to her.
- Like I'd let you talk to the queen.

10
The parade is really good this year.

11
Man, those horses can crap.

12
Next up is a marching band
from Muskogee, Oklahoma.

13
Muskogee?
That's like four hours from Tulsa!

14
Here's the float with the stars
of the popular daytime soap...

15
...Days of our Lives.

16
Oh, my God!

17
Aren't you one of the stars of the
popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?

18
I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!

19
I can't believe I forgot! I usually write
stuff like this down on my arm!

20
Stupid long sleeves!

21
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll come up with a good reason...

22
...why I wasn't there.

23
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:

24
"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. Sharp.
That means you, Tribbiani."

25
Like I was some kind of idiot.

26
- Well, you proved them wrong.
- Yeah.

27
Oh, Emma.

28
This is your first Thanksgiving.

29
What are you thankful for?

30
Mommy's boobies?

31
A lot of people are thankful for those.

32
Hello? Rachel?

33
Who is it?

34
It's your favorite sister.

35
- Jill?
- Amy!

36
Hide my rings.

37
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.

38
Do you have a hair straightener?

39
Um... Hi.

40
- Hi.
- Hi.

41
Hair straightener.

42
- I haven't seen you in, like, a year.
- I know. I know. I've just been crazed.

43
Well, me too. I had a baby.

44
I decorated Dad's office.

45
Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk
out of your vagina, not the same thing.

46
About that hair straightener,
honey, I really need one.

47
I'm gonna have dinner
at my boyfriend's house.

48
- Oh, my God.
- Uh-huh.

49
Is this Emmett?

50
It's Emma.

51
It's a girl?

52
- Hey, Amy.
- Amy, you remember Ross?

53
Not really.

54
But you are much cuter
than that geeky guy she used to date.

55
That was me.

56
No, he was this creepy guy from high
school who had this huge crush on her...

57
...since, like, the ninth grade.

58
Still me.

59
No, I'm not talking about you.

60
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.

61
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you
some time, okay? All me!

62
Careful. Careful.

63
Careful!

64
I'll tell you what.
For the rest of our lives...

65
...I'll be careful until told otherwise.

66
- This isn't the china we picked out.
- I know.

67
After you left the store,
I chose different ones.

68
- Why?
- Your taste is a little feminine for me.

69
Suddenly flowers are feminine?

70
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

71
- Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!
- What's going on, Joe?

72
Listen, I need a good lie.

73
Okay.

74
How about the whole "man walking
on the moon" thing, you know?

75
You can see the strings, people!

76
No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.

77
- Honey, you stink at lying.
- I do not.

78
Really? Let me ask you something.
Yesterday at the coffeehouse...

79
...I went to the bathroom. When I came
back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?

80
Somebody opened the door
to the coffeehouse...

81
...and a raccoon ran in and went
straight for your muffin. I said:

82
"Hey, don't eat that!
That's Phoebe's!" And he said...

83
He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."
What am I gonna do?

84
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
I'll help you.

85
- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
- Sure. What was the work thing?

86
Uh...

87
- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."
- Oh, man!

88
She's precious.

89
Do you ever worry
that she's gonna get your real nose?

90
Amy...

91
Yes, I do. I really do.

92
Hello?

93
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?

94
Sure. We don't live there, but...

95
Seriously? It's just these rooms?

96
- I thought you were a doctor.
- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.

97
Ew!

98
God, she is unbelievable.

99
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.
Is just as good as an MD.

100
Sure, Ross, yeah!

101
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
I want you there with your fossil brush.

102
- Stupid Thanksgiving.
- What?

103
- What? What happened?
- My boyfriend canceled on me.

104
I mean, I finally find a real relationship.

105
Someone that I can spend this day with,
and then his wife comes back into town!

106
I swear, it's almost not even
worth dating married guys.

107
Don't say that.

108
God, I was so looking forward to this.

109
It was gonna be such
a beautiful Thanksgiving.

110
We were gonna have sushi.

111
Amy, don't cry.

112
- Ross, can I talk to you in private?
- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or?

113
Look, I was thinking,
if it's okay with Monica...

114
...I would like to invite Amy
to Thanksgiving.

115
I think that's a great idea. It'll be like
the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.

116
Look, I know she's a little tough to take.

117
But she has nowhere else to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.

118
- And I would like them to bond.
- I don't want them bonding too much.

119
I don't want her telling Emma
she needs a nose job.

120
Ross, she may need one. We're just
gonna have to make our peace with that!

121
- Hi!
- Hey.

122
Hey, you guys. This is my sister Amy.

123
This is Chandler, Joey,
Phoebe, and you know Mon.

124
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

125
You're on Days of our Lives!

126
Yeah.

127
Wow! They must put
a lot of makeup on you.

128
Happy Thanksgiving.

129
- Hey.
- Hi.

130
So welcome. Is this the first time
you're seeing Emma?

131
Yeah, I think so.
It's nice to meet you, Emma.

132
- Phoebe.
- That's a funny noise.

133
- Pheebs? I still need some help here.
- Right. Okay.

134
So it's not just the lie you tell,
but it's the way you tell it. For example...

135
...if you look at the ground when
you talk, people know you're lying.

136
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basically just acting...

137
...and I am a terrific actor.
- You are a terrific actor.

138
- Hey. Where's the baby?
- We just put her down for a nap.

139
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?

140
If you guys died!

141
Thank you, Amy.

142
No, no, then I would get the baby.

143
It would be just like a movie. At first
I wouldn't know what to do with her.

144
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.

145
That's a great movie!

146
Yeah. Listen, not that you guys
could stop me or anything...

147
...because, you know, you'd be dead.

148
But I was thinking about
changing her name.

149
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.

150
Emma.

151
Emma? Ross wants you.

152
Phoebe!

153
Why does she keep making that noise?

154
Honey, I don't know
how to tell you this...

155
...but if something were to happen
to Ross or myself...

156
...you wouldn't get the baby.
- Well, who would?

157
Well, we haven't officially
asked them yet...

158
...but we would want
Monica and Chandler.

159
I can't believe you'd want us
to raise Emma.

160
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.

161
I don't believe this. Hold on a second.
You guys die...

162
...and I don't get your baby?

163
Amy, see, we're a lot closer
to Monica and Chandler.

164
We see them every day. And truthfully,
you don't seem connected to the baby.

165
Connected? To what? She's a lump.

166
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.

167
I mean, that you would
trust me with your child.

168
I mean, we all know
that Monica and I have been...

169
...trying to have a baby of our own.

170
You know, I've had my doubts
about my skills as a father, but...

171
That you two...

172
- That you two...
- This guy?

173
Seriously?

174
Okay, it's time for dinner.

175
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...

176
...and it's very expensive,
so please be careful.

177
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...

178
Okay, just to be clear, comedy with
the plates will not be well-received.

179
Hey!

180
How come my plate's less fancy
than everyone else's?

181
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?

182
No, honey. That's a special plate.

183
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.

184
I can't believe I won!

185
You know, this is such a slap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...

186
...and you would give your baby
to these strangers over me.

187
Monica is Ross' sister.

188
No, Ross' sister was really fat.

189
That was me.

190
No, she was this dorky girl in school who
followed Rachel around like a puppy...

191
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!

192
Okay, listen, I know you're having
a bit of a family crisis...

193
...but you don't have to take it out
on the plates.

194
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...

195
...should cut their food like this:

196
Now, see? This way,
you protect the plates...

197
...and let's face it, you have fun.

198
Okay, how about this?
If you guys die...

199
...and the crazy plate lady dies...

200
...then do I get the baby?
- No, if crazy plate lady...

201
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?

202
- Well, actually...
- Actually what?

203
It's just...
It's just that in that case...

204
...then Emma would go
to my parents.

205
- What?
- Hurts, doesn't it?

206
Who has to die for me to get her?

207
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?

208
No, that is not what we're saying.

209
Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.

210
Well, what's wrong with me?
Am I incompetent?

211
Because I managed to survive whatever
it is that killed the three of you!

212
You're taking this the wrong way.
We think you'll be a wonderful parent.

213
It's just... You're more
the, you know, fun parent.

214
Yeah, and we wanna make sure
Emma also has someone like Monica...

215
...who's more of a disciplinarian.

216
Someone who can be firm and strict.

217
That's not how you see me, is it?

218
No, you're all about the fun.

219
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?

220
No. You both are equally capable.

221
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.

222
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died...

223
...she'd have to give her up.

224
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.

225
I lie better than that, right?

226
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die, I get Emma.

227
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...

228
...gets taken away from me?
- There's your movie.

229
Hey, there you are.

230
- You disappeared after dinner.
- Did somebody miss me?

231
Was there a child to raise poorly?

232
Ross and Rachel don't know
what they're saying.

233
It's not like they're so responsible.

234
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a five-year-old condom.

235
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never will be.

236
No, you learn these things.
You grow into it.

237
Yeah, but it's not who I am.

238
Everything they said is exactly why I was
worried about having a kid. And it's true.

239
- And look, everybody knows it.
- I don't know it.

240
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'll be an amazing dad.

241
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.

242
Well, can you picture me saying,
"Go to your room, you're grounded"?

243
Can you hear me say,
"You're grounded"?

244
You said that to me last week.

245
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"

246
The producer from Days left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.

247
They said everybody's really pissed off
at me. And they all got to meet Santa!

248
It's okay.
I thought of the perfect lie for you.

249
It's easy to remember,
and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.

250
You weren't at the parade,
because you had a family emergency.

251
I like that! Yeah!

252
I wasn't at the parade,
because I had a family emergency.

253
What happened?

254
- My sister's raccoon came...
- No, nothing with a raccoon!

255
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Setting the table.

256
We thought it might be nice
to use the fancy china for dessert too.

257
How nice. Maybe later we can all
blow our noses on my wedding dress.

258
Hey, dude, you okay?
Sorry about before.

259
That's okay. You're totally right. I don't
know anything about disciplining a child.

260
But it did hurt my feelings,
and I want you to know that if I die...

261
...you don't get Joey.

262
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not talking to you.

263
You know, this is just...
This is classic Rachel.

264
Right. Remember in high school when
I died and didn't give you my baby?

265
This might be my one chance
to have a child, Rachel.

266
I mean, you know that I have been
so busy focusing on my career...

267
- What career?
- I'm a decorator.

268
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?

269
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koala bear.

270
- Why can't you ever be supportive?
- You want to talk supportive?

271
You didn't come and visit me when
I was in the hospital having the baby!

272
You didn't come see me in the hospital
when I was getting my lips done!

273
I did the first time.

274
You know what? You want to know
why I am not giving Emily to you?

275
- Emma.
- Whose side are you on?!

276
I'm not giving you Emma, because you
can't handle the responsibility of a child.

277
Well, how hard could it be?
You do it.

278
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

279
You wanna know why
you don't want me to have the baby?

280
Because you don't want me to be happy.

281
- You have always been jealous of me.
- Jealous of what?

282
Of your lack of responsibility?
Your immaturity?

283
Your total disregard
for other people's feelings?

284
To name a few.

285
You've always been like this.

286
You had to have everything,
and I couldn't have anything.

287
Like in junior high,
when you stole Timmy from me.

288
I mean, do you even realize
how much that hurt me?

289
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!

290
Come on, that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.

291
I cannot believe
that I invited you here today!

292
Yeah, well, you know what I cannot
believe? That my so-called sister...

293
...gets a 30% discount from Ralph
Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?

294
It's 45.

295
You bitch.

296
You just think you're so perfect...

297
...with your new baby
and your small apartment.

298
Well, let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.

299
Too far, Amy. Too far.

300
- You take that back.
- No.

301
- Take it back!
- No. What are you gonna do? Make me?

302
Hey, man, I work out!

303
- So do I.
- I do Pilates.

304
- I do yoga.
- Bring it on!

305
Put the plates in the boxes!
Put the plates in the boxes!

306
- Did you just push me?
- Yeah, I think I did.

307
All right, that's it.

308
Forget the bubble wrap!
There isn't time!

309
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!

310
- Shouldn't we stop this?
- Are you out of your mind?

311
Let's throw some Jell-O on them!

312
Gross!

313
All right, that is it! This is our apartment,
and you cannot behave this way!

314
If you can't act your age,
you shouldn't be here at all.

315
Those plates may not be as nice as
the pretty pink ones that I picked out...

316
...but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her now.

317
- I'm sorry.
- Mon, I'm so sorry.

318
Okay. That's better.

319
Now, I want you to apologize
to each other and mean it.

320
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

321
By the way, that fight
was totally arousing.

322
Dude, well done.

323
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.

324
Yeah? Well, thanks.

325
So...
So now do I get Joey?

326
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.

327
- Are you okay, Mon?
- Uh-huh.

328
I mean, these things happen.
I mean, it's just a plate.

329
- It's not like somebody died.
- It's all right. You can mourn.

330
Thank you. It was so beautiful!

331
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.

332
Actually, not pies. It's just pie.

333
I don't care.

334
Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.

335
Look, Amy...

336
...we got a little...

337
...a little out-of-control over there.

338
And I'm sorry.

339
You're my sister...

340
...and if it really means
that much to you...

341
- So you're gonna give me the baby?
- No, I was...

342
I was gonna let you use
my Ralph Lauren discount.

343
You are not gonna regret this.

344
- She needs changing.
- No, no, no. I'll get her.

345
I am super confident, totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.

346
I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me
get my trusty diaper bag here.

347
Well, what do you know?
I guess I'll be the one who dies first.

348
- Does Monica know about her plates?
- Nope.

349
- Broke them all, huh?
- Yep.

350
- You gonna tell her?
- Nope.

351
Hey. So I'm gonna
put the plates back.

352
I think you're right. We shouldn't
use these plates for a long time.

353
- Like only if the queen comes?
- Maybe not even then.

354
Hey. I did it.

355
I told my producer I had a family
emergency. He totally bought it.

356
- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.
- No problem. Next week, stealing.

357
- Bye, plates.
- You told her you broke all the plates?

358
What?!
Something happened with the plates?

359
Yeah, this raccoon came in...

﻿1
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

2
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
Yeah. That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
Single, are you?

5
Chandler Bing.

6
Hey. You're answering your own phone?

7
Where's your crazy assistant?

8
What's up, Joe?

9
Okay, what have we always wanted
to do together?

10
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

11
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

12
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside.

13
- Courtside? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

14
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball
and break my jaw with his knee.

15
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

16
- Hello?
- Joey just called.

17
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

18
Really? But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

19
If you go, we won't have a night together
for another week.

20
But honey, it's courtside.
The cheerleaders are gonna be right in f...

21
That's not the way to convince you.

22
Chandler, I don't wanna be
one of those wives that says:

23
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

24
So if you could just realize it
on your own...

25
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

26
I just gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's really looking forward to this.

27
Tell him you haven't seen
your wife in a long time.

28
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

29
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

30
Eh, yeah, I'll think of something.

31
Wow. Heh. Wow, you look, uh...

32
I mean, it's just, uh... That dress, uh...

33
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

34
Heh. Oh, they're good. It's just been
a while since I've seen you like this.

35
You clean up good.

36
Oh, really? Well, thank you.

37
Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that.

38
- Last time that happened, that happened.
- Oh, right, right.

39
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

40
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

41
- And thank you for watching the baby.
- Oh, it's fine.

42
Actually, I invited Mike over.

43
- Phoebe's Mike?
- Yeah.

44
- I didn't know you guys hung out.
- We don't...

45
...but I thought it'd be nice
to get to know him.

46
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

47
Oh, that's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

48
Is that gonna be awkward?
What are you guys gonna talk about?

49
I don't know. But you know,
we have a lot in common, you know?

50
Um, he plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

51
Uh, he's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

52
- Yeah?
- Hi.

53
- Hi.
- Hi.

54
Ooh. Girls' night out indeed.

55
Okay, so I think Emma is probably
down for the night...

56
...but if you need anything...
- Rach, we'll be fine.

57
- You go have fun.
- Okay, you too.

58
- Thanks.
- And I hope you score.

59
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

60
So, welcome.

61
- I got beer.
- I got bottled breast milk.

62
- Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
- Okay.

63
So, um, ahem,
Phoebe tells me you, uh, play piano.

64
Yeah.

65
You know, I used to, uh,
play keyboards in college.

66
Oh. Do you have one here?

67
No.

68
Okay. Heh.

69
Ah.

70
Um, uh, you know, I'm divorced.

71
Uh, Phoebe... Phoebe says you're...
You've been divorced?

72
Yeah, yeah.

73
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I don't really like to talk about it.

74
That's okay.
We'll talk about something else.

75
- So you're a paleontologist, right?
- Yeah.

76
- My cousin's a paleontologist.
- Ah.

77
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

78
- Hi.
- Hey.

79
- Welcome home.
- Oh, well, look at you.

80
Yeah. What do you think?

81
Well, it looks great. It's just...

82
Well, I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so...

83
You see what I mean? Heh.

84
Hey. How come your door's locked?

85
- Just a second.
- No, no, no.

86
- Joey can't know that I'm here.
- Why not?

87
I didn't know how to tell him
I couldn't go to the game...

88
...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
- So you lied to him?

89
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

90
Except with you.

91
Hey, open the door. What's going on?

92
- What are you...?
- Hi.

93
Why are you dressed like that?

94
Because, um, well, Chandler's
gonna be home in a couple of days...

95
...so I thought I would just, um, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

96
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

97
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

98
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

99
"Really sexy.
Could I be any more turned on?"

100
You know.

101
Okay. Wait a minute.

102
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

103
Because one of them is for you.

104
Cheers. Okay, bye-bye.

105
You know, it's funny. I've been, uh,
practicing the art of seduction myself.

106
- You might wanna keep practicing.
- Yeah.

107
- It's Joey.
- What?

108
- Hey, Joe.
- Dude, come home.

109
- What? Why?
- Come home.

110
Look, I can't. What's going on?

111
I don't know how to tell you this,
but, uh, I think Monica's cheating on you.

112
I told you you shouldn't have married
someone so much hotter than you.

113
All right, if you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

114
- No.
- I just heard him.

115
Can you hear him now?

116
No. All right, I'm going in.

117
- No, wait.
- I heard him again.

118
All right, look, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

119
Okay, I'll see you when you get here.

120
I'm gonna wait out in the hall
in case the dude comes out.

121
- Is that really necessary?
- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

122
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

123
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

124
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

125
Eleven minutes.

126
And now 12.

127
- So you like the beer?
- I do. I do.

128
- Although, it's actually a lager.
- Huh.

129
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

130
I don't know.

131
We could look it up.

132
Things are about to get wild.

133
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have...

134
...sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

135
Oh, God. It seems like forever ago.

136
I know.

137
Ah. So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

138
Well, um, I don't know.
I mean, for a long time, nothing.

139
But, you know, actually,
right before you picked me up...

140
...Ross and I had a, uh, little thing.

141
Oh, my God. I love things.
What happened?

142
Well, um, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

143
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh, then we had a little, um...

144
...eye contact.

145
- Eye contact?
- Mm-hm.

146
I hope you were using protection.

147
Excuse me, um, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

148
Should we send them something back?
Ooh, let's send them mashed potatoes.

149
No, wait. Don't do that.

150
That's gonna make them think
they can come over.

151
So, what if they do?

152
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

153
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

154
You know, not everything
has to go as far as eye contact.

155
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
that you're not in Tulsa.

156
Don't you think it's better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

157
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

158
I heard it.

159
I don't want him to think
that I'm having an affair.

160
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape...

161
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

162
Hear me out, woman.

163
I'll go down the fire escape, then I'll wait.

164
Then when I come up the stairs
it'll be like I just got back.

165
Then Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

166
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

167
I heard it.

168
- I'm just gonna wait.
- The scary pigeon's back?

169
It's huge.

170
Oh, my God. I can't believe
you live in that building.

171
My grandmother lives in that building.

172
Ida Green?
No sense of personal space...

173
...kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

174
- "Spuds" is your grandmother?
- That's my bubby.

175
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

176
Um, maybe we can get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

177
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen...

178
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

179
- All right.
- It's no big deal.

180
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

181
Oh, well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but, uh...

182
Then can I have your number?

183
I'm sorry, no.

184
Okay.

185
Oh, sure.

186
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number.

187
Okay, thanks.
I'll give you a call later tonight.

188
- Great.
- Bye.

189
Bye.

190
Wow. So that's great.

191
You, Bill, Ross and Emma
are gonna be so happy together.

192
What were you thinking?

193
I don't know. He was cute and he liked me.
It was an impulse.

194
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

195
- Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?
- No.

196
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

197
"Hey, Ross, you know,
I think we had a moment before."

198
"Yeah. Ahem. Me too."

199
"Well, but I'm not sure
I really want to do anything about it."

200
"Yeah. Ahem. Me neither."

201
"Should we just live together...

202
...and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

203
"Yeah, that works for me."

204
Yeah, I see what you mean.

205
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

206
But your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

207
- What? Hey.
- Better.

208
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

209
You know?
I should just move on with my life.

210
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

211
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

212
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

213
Ross is gonna pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

214
Oh, my God, Ross.

215
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

216
Oh, I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone.

217
"Oh, I have to get
my number back. Oh, my God. He's gone."

218
Dead on.

219
- You know, I'm gonna take off.
- So soon?

220
- Yeah.
- Okay.

221
Well, thanks, uh... Thanks for the beer.

222
- You mean lager?
- Ah, yeah. Good times.

223
- Hello?
- Hey, Mike, it's me.

224
Listen, is, um... Is Ross near you?

225
Uh, no, I just left.

226
Well, you have to go back in.

227
What? Go back?
To the land where time stands still?

228
I'm so sorry, honey, but...

229
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number...

230
...and, um, she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

231
So you have to intercept all his calls.

232
I can't do that.

233
- He says he can't do that.
- Oh, give me the phone.

234
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

235
If you do this,
Phoebe will do anything you want.

236
- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
- All right. Thank you. Hello?

237
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

238
All right, I'll do it.

239
But really, how much dirtier can it get?

240
Oh, Mike.

241
Bye.

242
Hey, buddy.

243
Uh, hi.

244
- Um, can I come back in?
- Why?

245
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

246
But you left.

247
Wow, that didn't take long.

248
I thought you said Tulsa
was like a three-hour flight?

249
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

250
Yeah.

251
Chandler, you're home.

252
That's right. Your husband's home.
So now the sex can stop.

253
What are you saying?

254
Joey said you're in here
with another man.

255
There's no man in here.
How dare you accuse me of that.

256
All right. All right.

257
Then maybe you won't mind if me
and my friend take a look around, huh?

258
What's he doing?

259
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

260
Bedroom's clear. Although
you might need some new pillows.

261
All right, well, I'll check the guest room.

262
Why do I smell men's cologne?

263
I think that's you.

264
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

265
There's nobody here, Joe.

266
I guess not.

267
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apology.

268
- You're right, Monica. I'm so sorry.
- It's an honest mistake.

269
It could happen to anybody.
All right, see you.

270
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

271
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

272
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

273
So with the exception
of the fermentation process...

274
...beer and ale
are basically the same thing.

275
Fascinating, isn't it?

276
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

277
I'll get it.

278
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

279
It's for you.

280
I don't understand
what just happened here.

281
What's going on?

282
I'm sorry.

283
I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted
to spend the night with Monica...

284
...and I didn't know...
I didn't think you'd understand.

285
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh?

286
You think I'm, like, duh.

287
- Joey?
- Yeah.

288
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

289
Yeah, I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

290
Yeah, you could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

291
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

292
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.

293
All right.

294
- You can go.
- What?

295
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

296
- Really? You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

297
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

298
- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
- It's gonna be so hot.

299
- Bye.
- Bye.

300
Thanks.

301
Here's your ticket.

302
Thanks. Hey, listen...

303
...I'm never gonna lie to you again, okay?

304
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

305
Thanks, man.

306
- Where you going?
- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

307
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
Oh, God. So glad you're back.

309
So, what did you guys do?

310
Oh, you know, we just drank some beer.

311
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

312
It's true, I did.

313
- Well, goodbye.
- Okay.

314
- Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.
- I know. It was fun.

315
See you, guys.

316
Rachel, lock the door.
Lock the door, seriously.

317
Oh, shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

318
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

319
No, just his mom.

320
Oh. Around 8:30?

321
- Yeah.
- Then again at 9:00?

322
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

323
Hello?

324
Uh, no, she's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

325
Bill from the bar?

326
Okay, Bill from the bar,
I'll make sure she gets your number.

327
Ah.

328
So, uh... So how was it?

329
Did you guys...?
You guys have a good time?

330
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.

331
Uh, Rach?

332
Yeah?

333
Never mind.

334
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

335
Hey.

336
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

337
Stout. That's a kind of beer.

﻿1
Oh.

2
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna?

3
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

4
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

5
- Hey.
- What's up?

6
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

7
And, um, then we're gonna grab
some food. So if you want...

8
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

9
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

10
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

11
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

12
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

13
Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him.

14
Oh.

15
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

16
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

17
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

18
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

19
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

20
This is none of our business.

21
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

22
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

23
Ha, ha. I love Barbados.

24
- I can't believe I'm kissing you.
- Ha, ha.

25
- I'm kissing Rachel!
- Ha, ha.

26
- I know. I'm her. Ha, ha.
- Oh!

27
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

28
- What?
- Get over here!

29
- Oh.
- Whoa!

30
Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are!

31
Thank you.

32
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

33
- Well, I only said that because of Ross.
- Mm.

34
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

35
Ross and Charlie?

36
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

37
- Ah, who am I to talk? Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

38
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

39
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

40
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

41
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

42
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

43
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

44
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

45
Wow! Wait a minute.

46
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

47
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

48
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

49
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

50
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

51
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

52
Um...

53
- Is everything okay?
- It's just... I don't think I can do this.

54
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

55
- I saw that report, with the infrared...
- No! No.

56
No, uh...

57
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

58
Before anything more happens between us,
I need to know he's okay with it.

59
- I, uh, completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

60
I just need a second before I can,
you know...

61
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

62
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

63
That's the door. He's gone.

64
And she's turning on the TV...

65
...and watching Miss Congeniality.

66
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

67
Hey, what are you guys doing?

68
Oh, we're just... We're sad to go,
so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.

69
I love you...

70
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

71
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

72
Bye.

73
Okay. Um, hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

74
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

75
That's the situation as we know it.

76
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

77
- You got it.
- Thanks.

78
Thank you.

79
Other wall, people! Other wall!

80
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

81
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

82
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

83
All right? So just be nonchalant.

84
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

85
Okay, just hide.

86
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

87
There's no room under the bed...

88
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

89
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

90
I really don't.

91
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

92
I don't believe this.

93
- Have you guys been...?
- Shh! This is the listening side of the wall.

94
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

95
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

96
Uh-huh, right. Yeah.

97
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out
since the day I met her.

98
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

99
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

100
...oh, before you know it, we were kissing.

101
How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?

102
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

103
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

104
You would think.

105
Joey?

106
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

107
Psst!

108
What? Hey!

109
What are you...? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

110
Yeah!

111
Now, what is this?

112
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

113
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

114
No, no. Have you thought about
how complicated this could get?

115
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

116
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

117
And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
he deserves the same from you?

118
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

119
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

120
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

121
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

122
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

123
Get out!

124
Are they right?

125
Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should...

126
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

127
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

128
Yeah, I think that would be best.

129
So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off.

130
- Although...
- I like "although."

131
- Uh...
- I mean, you know...

132
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

133
...six years.

134
Six years?

135
Wow. That's almost as long as high school.

136
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

137
Absolutely.

138
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

139
I'm thinking about you.

140
Yeah.

141
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

142
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

143
Seriously, what is it?

144
Nothing. It's really... It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

145
What's wrong?

146
Ah. Sorry, I just, um...

147
I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.

148
Well, maybe I can help.

149
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

150
- Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.
- Yeah.

151
- Hey. You guys ready to go?
- Hey.

152
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

153
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

154
You're not supposed to take that.

155
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

156
Learn about Jesus.

157
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

158
Uh, no. I couldn't find him.
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

159
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

160
Stop it.

161
Ph.D.

162
You're filthy.

163
Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?

164
Uh, actually, I think she went to the salon.

165
Oh, yeah.
Oh, she went to the salon, all right.

166
Check it out!

167
Whose day just got better?

168
Chandler!

169
Hey! Aah.

170
- What do you think?
- I think...

171
- I think I can see your scalp.
- Ha, ha.

172
Don't you just love it?

173
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

174
It's, uh, something. You go, girlfriend.

175
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

176
I thought so.

177
Oh, and listen to this.

178
What do you know?
It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

179
Ooh.

180
Wow, it's, uh, kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

181
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

182
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

183
Oh, I mean, I... Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

184
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

185
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen lverson over there.

186
Um, once we're in the air
and the captain turns off the seat belt sign...

187
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

188
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

189
- Because items may shift during...
- Oh, you're not good at this.

190
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

191
- It's Saturday, right?
- Oh.

192
What?

193
- Um, I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

194
- I have a date.
- Wh...?

195
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

196
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

197
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

198
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

199
Three months?

200
Okay.

201
This is none of my business, but, um,
how long are you gonna keep seeing her?

202
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

203
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

204
When you get home, maybe there'll be
a special delivery package waiting for you.

205
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

206
- Pull out the packing material...
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

207
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

208
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

209
Okay. Good luck.

210
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

211
Oh, I guess so. I'm just... I'm really nervous.

212
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

213
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

214
Ooh.

215
Still nervous?

216
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

217
- Hey, Rach, uh...
- Yeah?

218
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

219
Good luck.

220
- Hey. Ha.
- Hey.

221
So I, um...

222
I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.

223
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up...

224
- So sorry to hear about that, by the way.
- Hmm, yeah.

225
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...

226
Well...

227
- You kissed.
- Wh...?

228
What? Ha, ha.

229
What? Ha, ha.
What would give you that idea?

230
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

231
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

232
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

233
It's okay. You know, look...

234
...I totally understand, all right? You guys...

235
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And...

236
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

237
Yeah.

238
- Now I have something...
- I am speechless.

239
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean...

240
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

241
- Oh, well, look, before you go...
- No, I mean it.

242
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

243
I am those things, yeah.

244
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

245
...I may have to rethink some stuff.

246
Dude!

247
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you...

248
I can't think of anything. Ha, ha.

249
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

250
- So hi.
- Hi.

251
- So, you, uh, talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

252
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

253
- Oh. So everything's okay? Oh.
- Oh, no, it's great.

254
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

255
Well, I'm so excited about this.

256
Really? Ha, ha. Excited?

257
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

258
Excuse me.

259
You didn't tell him, did you?

260
I couldn't. He was saying all these
really nice things about me.

261
I didn't want him to get mad
and take them back.

262
- I'm gonna edge out Chandler!
- Oh, God.

263
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

264
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

265
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

266
Ooh, that was fast.

267
Oh, uh, no, she's not here yet.

268
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

269
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

270
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

271
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYI.

272
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

273
Her name's Precious?

274
Is she a pure breed, or did you
pick her up at the pound? Ha, ha.

275
I just want to give you a heads-up.

276
Okay. And if she gets upset...

277
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

278
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

279
- I'm... I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

280
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

281
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

282
Ow!

283
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

284
So if you want people to see them...

285
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

286
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

287
Mm.

288
Aah! Aah!

289
You like that, right?

290
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from 10.

291
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from Apocalypse Now.

292
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

293
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it...

294
I hate them.

295
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did I? Let's refresh.

296
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

297
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

298
Again, let's journey back.

299
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

300
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

301
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

302
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

303
Ow!

304
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

305
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

306
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

307
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Green? Huh?

308
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

309
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

310
Ooh, hey, Emma, Daddy has some
presents for you, okay?

311
I want you to wait right here.

312
- Come here, sweetie.
- Oh.

313
Ross, um, actually,
there's something that, uh...

314
...I really need to talk to you about.

315
Okay, shoot.

316
Okay. Um, all right, here's the deal.

317
Ah! Oh, no!

318
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

319
- Uh, look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

320
Why? Why me?

321
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?

322
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

323
Well, yeah, uh...

324
- Look, it's about me and...
- Oh, not another one!

325
Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

326
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

327
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- Uh, you think?

328
Okay. Bye.

329
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

330
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so...

331
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

332
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

333
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

334
All right.

335
Susie... Can I call you Susie?

336
My name is Precious.

337
I can't say that.

338
Um, Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

339
Mike and I are back together.
And, um, unfortunately...

340
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

341
He's very sorry about that, and wishes you
the best of luck in all your endeavors.

342
I just can't believe this. Why?

343
- Well, I don't...
- Why would he do this?

344
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

345
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

346
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

347
Have some pride, for the love of God!

348
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

349
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

350
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

351
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

352
Look, Precious...

353
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

354
...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.

355
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

356
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

357
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

358
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't need him.

359
I deserve to be treated with respect.

360
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

361
You're welcome.

362
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

363
Not really.

364
I have a problem.

365
Really? What happened?

366
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...

367
...and, um, I got stuck.

368
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move. Ha, ha.

369
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

370
I guess so.

371
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

372
- Hey.
- Hi.

373
- So? Did you, uh, tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

374
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

375
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

376
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

377
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

378
"I didn't mean it.

379
I'm so sorry."

380
Yeah, because that's what we do.

381
All right, all right, okay. Um, how about this?
How about this? Tomorrow...

382
Mm-hm?

383
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

384
Okay, that sounds fair.

385
- That just means, once again, we can't...
- I know.

386
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

387
- No! Pfft. Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

388
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

389
Yep. Good night.

390
Oh.

391
Good night.

392
- Good night.
- Stop saying good night.

393
Okay.

394
I'm so sorry.

395
Look what I found in the drawer.

396
And you said I'd never wear this.

397
Now that I untangled you,
how about you do a little something for me?

398
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

399
- Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

400
Okay.

401
I just don't get why you like it so much.

402
She's an FBI agent posing
as a beauty contestant!

﻿1
Mm, mm, mm.

2
This cake is amazing. Mm.

3
My God, get a room.

4
Mm.
I would get a room with this cake.

5
I think I could show
this cake a good time.

6
If you had to, what would
you give up, food or sex?

7
Sex.

8
Seriously, answer faster.

9
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

10
No, when she said "sex," I wasn't
thinking about sex with you, heh.

11
It's like a giant hug.

12
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up, sex or food?

13
- Food.
- Okay, how about, um, sex or dinosaurs?

14
Oh, my God, it's like Sophie's Choice.

15
Oh, God.

16
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?

17
Uh... Ooh... Uh...

18
I don't know, it's too hard.

19
No, you gotta pick one.

20
Uh, food. No, sex.

21
Food. Sex. Food. Sex...
I don't know. Oh, God, I want both.

22
I want... I want girls on bread.

23
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute.

24
- Oh, she looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.

25
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.

26
Yeah.

27
Look, there's Chandler.

28
Oh, who's the blond? She's pretty.

29
He's having an affair.

30
He is not having an affair.

31
I'm always right about these things.

32
No, you're not. Last week,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

33
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...

34
...just to tell it.

35
There's something going on with them.

36
Look. He's getting into the car with her.

37
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

38
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

39
Huh?

40
- Okay, duck down.
- Oh.

41
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. It's Phoebe.

42
Um, I know that Monica
is working today...

43
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.

44
Oh, uh, I have to work too.
Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day.

45
Uh, well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...

46
...because we were gonna see,
you know, either, um, Liar Liar or, um...

47
...Betrayal or An Affair to Remember.

48
Those are all really old.

49
Okay, then maybe it'll be, um...

50
Dude, Where's My Car?

51
- What?
- They're in a car.

52
Okay. Well, talk to you later,
okay? Bye.

53
Jeez.

54
Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
and follow them.

55
Oh, yeah, okay.

56
Let me just grab my night-vision goggles
and my stun gun. Heh.

57
I got them.

58
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.

59
Hey, you smell like
perfume and cigarettes.

60
- I was in the car with Nancy.
- Nancy doesn't smoke.

61
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.

62
So... What did you think
of the house?

63
It's everything we've been looking for.

64
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wainscoting...

65
...the crown molding
and the dormer windows in the attic?

66
And the wiggle woms
and the zip zorps.

67
What were the things you said?

68
- Don't you love the huge yard?
- The fireplace in the bedroom.

69
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

70
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!

71
This is bringing out
a lovely color in you.

72
So do you think we should get it?

73
I don't know. What do you think?

74
- I think we should.
- I do too.

75
- This is huge.
- I know.

76
How bad
do you wanna smoke now?

77
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.

78
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.

79
If she asks you, I was at work all day.

80
Got you. When do we tell them?

81
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?

82
Okay. Right.

83
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
- I know. Good luck with it.

84
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

85
I'm telling you guys, we followed
them out to a house in Westchester.

86
They went in for 45 minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.

87
- Chandler?
Mm-hm.

88
Forty-five minutes?

89
Well, something's not right.

90
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

91
I know, and with the baby coming?

92
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.

93
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?

94
Why? Who'd you see him with?

95
- No one. I'm just saying if we did...
- Tell me what you know!

96
No one. Nothing. Mike's a great guy.
It was hypothetical.

97
All right. He is a good guy.

98
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

99
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way I...

100
Who did you see him with?

101
Oh, look at her. So happy.

102
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.

103
Hey, is, uh... Is Chandler here?

104
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why, what's up?

105
Well...

106
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you and we love you.

107
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.

108
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

109
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.

110
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.

111
They went in together. I'm so sorry.

112
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.

113
What did you think of the house?

114
What?

115
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?

116
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.

117
Did you think the neighborhood
was homey?

118
- Hey.
- You son of a bitch.

119
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?

120
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.

121
And, um,
they think you're having an affair.

122
- Who's Nancy?
- What's going on?

123
Uh...

124
Okay, uh...

125
All right, you better sit down.

126
- This is... This is pretty big.
- Yeah.

127
I'm not having an affair.

128
Nancy is our realtor.

129
I knew he couldn't be with a woman
for 45 minutes.

130
Why do you have a realtor?

131
Um, she's been showing us houses
outside of the city.

132
- What?
- Are you serious?

133
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...

134
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't wanna raise a kid in the city.

135
So you're... So you're gonna move?

136
Oh, my God.

137
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

138
What is wrong with raising a kid
in the city?

139
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.

140
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it.

141
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.

142
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...

143
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.

144
So you wanna buy a house
in the '50s.

145
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?

146
You can't move out of the city.
What if...?

147
What if you want Chinese food
at 5 a. M?

148
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?

149
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?

150
You know what? If you want to look
for a house, that's okay.

151
No. No, it's not. Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

152
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.

153
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you wanna be.

154
Actually...

155
...we already found a house we love.

156
- What?
- About an hour ago, we made an offer.

157
Bet you wish I was
having an affair now, huh?

158
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.

159
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.

160
And then there's these old maple trees.

161
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?

162
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.

163
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?

164
Because I can stop doing that.

165
I really, really think I can.

166
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

167
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.

168
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

169
- Yeah, it is.
- What the hell are you doing?

170
Well, it is, all right? When we were
out there today, all I kept thinking was:

171
"I can't believe Chandler is
screwing this woman...

172
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live."

173
Yeah, but so is this.

174
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
you have to leave here.

175
I mean, how can you leave this place?

176
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

177
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

178
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

179
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

180
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

181
Or a hat?"

182
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

183
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

184
You can see where he'd have trouble.

185
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

186
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

187
Your money's mine, Green.

188
Your fly's open, Geller.

189
You know what I just realized?

190
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

191
Coincidence?

192
Hey, that's "jo-incidence" with a "C."

193
Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

194
Ooh.

195
Oh!

196
Ooh. That had to hurt.

197
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

198
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

199
We know.

200
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

201
No, you wanna put them
in concentric circles.

202
I want to do this.

203
Every year.

204
It's stuck.

205
Well...

206
Step. How did it get on?

207
I put it on to scare Chandler.

208
Oh, my God!
Monica's gonna totally freak out.

209
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

210
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head inside a turkey's ass.

211
Ooh, ooh. Monica.

212
Ooh.

213
Did you get the turkey...?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

214
Who is that?

215
It's Joey.

216
I got it.

217
How about if we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.

218
Ooh, that's interesting.

219
If you win...

220
...we give up the bird.
- Aah!

221
But if we win...

222
...we get your apartment.

223
Ooh!

224
- Deal!
- What?

225
"What was Monica's nickname
when she was a field-hockey goalie?"

226
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct.

227
"Rachel claims
this is her favorite movie."

228
- Dangerous Liaisons.
- Correct.

229
- "Her actual favorite is?" Correct.
- Weekend at Bernie's.

230
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

231
- Okay, everyday use.
- Fancy.

232
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

233
- Two seconds.
- Uh, 11?

234
Eleven. Unbelievable.
Eleven is correct.

235
- Yes!
Ha-ha-ha.

236
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"

237
- Fourteen?
- No, 19.

238
Thanks, man.

239
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

240
- His name was?"
- Maurice.

241
- "His profession was?"
- Space cowboy!

242
Correct.

243
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

244
Oh.

245
Oh, gosh.

246
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

247
It has something to do
with transponding.

248
Oh! Oh! He's a transponster.

249
That's not even a word!

250
Oh, my God.

251
- Oh, my God.
- No!

252
Whoo!

253
You know what? You are mean boys
who are just being mean.

254
Hey, don't get mad at us.
No one forced you to raise the stakes.

255
That is not true. She did. She forced me.

256
We'd still be here if you hadn't
got the question wrong.

257
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!

258
Don't blame the questions!

259
Would you all stop yelling
in our apartment?

260
You are ruining moving day for us.

261
Chandler!

262
Chandler, I saw what you were doing
through the window.

263
I saw what you were doing to my sister.
Now, get out here!

264
Well, listen, we had a good run.

265
You know? What was it?
Four, five months?

266
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime.

267
So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.

268
Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?

269
What the hell are you doing?

270
Hey, what's going on?

271
Well, I think... I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

272
Dude, he's right there.

273
I thought you were my best friend.
This is my sister.

274
My best friend and my sister.
I cannot believe this.

275
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

276
Okay? I'm in love with her.

277
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

278
I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.

279
My best friend and my sister.

280
I cannot believe this.

281
This is the last box of your clothes.

282
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

283
Funny, I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

284
Okay, you guys, I don't mean
to make things worse, but...

285
...I don't wanna live
with Rachel anymore.

286
- What?
- You're just so mean to each other.

287
And I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

288
Well, Phoebe, that's fine
because I'm not moving.

289
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

290
I know I said some bad stuff...

291
...but Rachel does have some qualities
that make her a good roommate.

292
She gets tons of catalogs...

293
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages
of the things she thinks I'd like.

294
- What else?
- Uh...

295
When I take a shower...

296
...she leaves me little notes
on the mirror.

297
Yeah, I do. I do do that.

298
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

299
When I fall asleep on the couch
after reading...

300
...she covers me over with a blanket.

301
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

302
And when I told her I was
gonna move in with Chandler...

303
...she was really supportive.

304
You were so great.

305
You made it so easy.

306
And now you have to leave.

307
And I have to live with a boy!

308
Hey.

309
- She really left.
- I know.

310
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

311
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

312
What the hell is that dog doing here?

313
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
- Mm.

314
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

315
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

316
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

317
...or projectile vomiting.

318
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

319
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

320
...syphilis and stuff...

321
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

322
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

323
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

324
That's so sweet.

325
Thank you.

326
Mm.

327
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

328
And a crappy New Year.

329
Hear, hear.

330
You can't move. You just...
You just can't.

331
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.

332
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.

333
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...

334
...and you guys are just having dinner...

335
...or watching TV or something...

336
...but it makes me feel better.

337
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?

338
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

339
They don't make me feel so good.

340
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...

341
...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.

342
Hello?

343
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.

344
And?

345
Yeah...

346
Okay. Thanks.

347
They passed.

348
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.

349
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

350
Well, there you go.

351
I'm really sorry, you guys.

352
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
that phone call didn't come...

353
...before I told you about looking
through the window.

354
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.

355
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be okay.

356
Love you guys.

357
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.

358
That's okay. We understand.

359
Yeah, and about this Nancy...

360
If you're not sleeping with her,
should I?

361
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just, uh...

362
- I loved that one so much.
- Yeah.

363
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

364
- What?
- We got the house.

365
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.

366
We got it? We got the house?

367
- We're getting a house.
- Oh!

368
Mm.

369
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.

370
We're growing up.

371
We sure are.

372
Who's gonna tell them?

373
- Not it.
- Not it. Damn it!

374
- And, Rachel, this is yours.
- Aah!

375
Why? What are these for?

376
- You'll see.
- All right, everybody open them.

377
Oh, wow, this is so beautiful.

378
Oh, these are the ones
I was looking at in the store.

379
- I know.
- Oh, I love this.

380
A meatball sub.

381
Thanks.

382
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?

383
Well, I didn't know
how to tell you before...

384
...but we got the house.
- Enjoy.

385
What did they say?

﻿1
- Hey, guys...
- Wait! Let me tell them.

2
- Oh, sure.
- Joey's gonna be...

3
...a celebrity guest on a game show.

4
- Hey.
- Oh.

5
- Really? Which one?
Mm-mm.

6
Fish. Seaweed.

7
- A sunken ship.
- Things you find in the ocean.

8
- You're gonna be on Pyramid!
- Yeah.

9
- That was our favorite game show ever.
- Except for Match Game.

10
- Or Win, Lose or Draw.
- Oh!

11
What did I marry into?

12
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?

13
Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe
a bachelorette party.

14
Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.

15
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid
college alumni thing.

16
Oh, I can't believe you get
to meet Donny Osmond.

17
- Seriously?
- Yeah-huh.

18
Ross and I always wanted to be
Donny and Marie.

19
Mm-hm.

20
You guys just keep getting
cooler and cooler.

21
Yeah, we used to perform
for our family and friends.

22
Oh, God, that's right. I blocked that out.

23
I'm a little bit country

24
And I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll

25
I'm leaving you.

26
It's so weird to see
all these people again.

27
Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.

28
- Who?
- He was roommates with John Rosoff.

29
He went out with Andrea Tamborino.

30
She dumped him for Michael Skloff.

31
Did I go to this school?

32
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
You gotta remember her.

33
Sure. Nice.

34
Dude, you're married to my sister.

35
You're right. By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.

36
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?

37
Are you asking permission
to break the pact?

38
Yes, please.

39
Hey. Hey, check out the fliers for the band.

40
- I made them on a Macintosh.
- Awesome.

41
The name really stands out.

42
Thanks to a little something called
helvetica bold 24-point.

43
Man, we're gonna rock
that Asian Student Union.

44
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Missy.

45
Our band is playing on Friday.

46
Yeah, you should come check us out.

47
We're called Way/No Way.

48
- No way.
- Way.

49
- Great. I'll be there.
- Fresh.

50
- Boss.
- Mint.

51
- She's gone.
- I know it.

52
- I am totally gonna ask her out.
- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.

53
- I said it first, bro.
- Well, I thought it first, homes.

54
- Look, if you date...
- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?

55
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.

56
I mean, we can get laid
any time we want.

57
Totally.

58
- I had sex in high school.
- Me too. I'm good at it.

59
All right, I say we make a pact.

60
Neither of us will go out
with Missy Goldberg.

61
You got it.

62
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...

63
...who we can't go out with.
- Those are the pacts.

64
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably
couldn't get her anyway.

65
Maybe not you.

66
Well, I officially give you permission
to break the pact.

67
Thank you.

68
All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary
it used to be going up to girls in college?

69
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know. And I can't stop sweating.

70
Five, four, three. Applause.

71
Yeah!

72
Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
here on Pyramid.

73
Let's meet our contestants.
First, Gene Lester is a database specialist.

74
He's gonna be playing with
Days of Our Lives star Joey Tribbiani.

75
And over here, we have Henrietta Cherry.

76
I know it can be intimidating for
regular people to be around celebrities...

77
...but relax. I'm just like you,
only better-looking and richer.

78
She'll be playing with star
of General Hospital Leslie Charleson.

79
Welcome, everybody. Good luck
to all of you. Let's play Pyramid.

80
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
before the show.

81
Gene, you won the toss,
so you'll start. Which category?

82
- "You Crossed the Line."
- "You Crossed the Line." Joey...

83
...describe for Gene these things
that have lines.

84
Give me 20 seconds on the clock,
please. Ready? Go.

85
Uh, okay,
it's a store like a supermarket.

86
Oh. I see what I did there. Okay, okay.
Uh, I'm writing in my...

87
- Diary.
- No, more like a notebook.

88
Damn it. Okay.

89
Um, oh, if I'm building a house,
the plan...

90
...isn't called a "shmooprint"...

91
I can't do that either?

92
Oh, in high school, I once had sex
with a girl right in the middle of the?

93
- Cafeteria?
- Yeah, but they're not looking for that.

94
Aw...

95
- Thank you so much for this.
- Aw, you like it?

96
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.

97
- Hee, hee.
- Aw.

98
When's the dirty stuff starting?

99
- What?
- The strippers and the guys dancing...

100
...and, you know,
pee-pees flying about.

101
Oh!

102
Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be
any "flying about." Ha, ha.

103
We thought we were
a little too mature for stuff like that.

104
Oh, okay.

105
I see what you're doing. That's fine.
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.

106
Mm, raunchy.

107
Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
that kind of a party.

108
Really? So this is?

109
This is my big sendoff into
married life?

110
Rachel, this is the only
bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.

111
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.

112
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?

113
No.

114
- Phoebe, of course there's more.
- Okay.

115
I mean,
let me just go talk to Monica...

116
...and get an ETA on the pee-pees. Heh.

117
Now, Gene, I must remind you,
you need all six of these to stay in the game.

118
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."

119
Bah, they might as well
just give us the points. Ha-ha-ha.

120
Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
Ready? Go.

121
- You put this in your coffee.
- Uh, a spoon. Your hands. Your face.

122
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

123
- It's heavier than milk.
- A rock. A dog. The Earth. Heh, heh.

124
- Pass.
- Ugh.

125
- You put it on a sandwich.
- Salami. Anchovies. Jam.

126
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

127
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?

128
- Pass.
- Ugh.

129
- You put this on a hamburger. Yes!
- Ketchup! Relish!

130
- Stop!
- Oh.

131
Oh, time's up.
Well, Joey, you were, uh...

132
...almost on a roll there, ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

133
Gene, you'll have a chance to go to
the Winner's Circle, but now...

134
...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's
Circle to try your luck for $10,000...

135
...right after this. Don't go away.

136
And we're out.

137
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?

138
Hey.

139
I got a kid starting college.
I have to get surgery on my knee.

140
You just lost me 10 grand.

141
Oh, wow.

142
I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise,
we'll do better next time.

143
Well, I will, because I won't be
playing with you.

144
Hey, some of those were pretty hard.

145
Like, why would there be
a ghost in my fridge?

146
Yeah.

147
- So Saturday night?
- I'd love to.

148
Great.

149
So how come it took you so long
to ask me out?

150
Oh, well, uh,
this is gonna sound kind of silly...

151
...but do you remember
my roommate, Chandler Bing?

152
Sure. He was in your "band."

153
It's been 16 years,
but the air quotes still hurt. Heh.

154
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Um, anyway...

155
Ahem, well, he and I
both really liked you a lot, um...

156
...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
our friendship, so we made a pact...

157
...that neither of us could ask you out.

158
- Really?
- Yeah, why?

159
Well, Chandler and I used to make out.

160
A lot.

161
- You did?
- Yeah.

162
- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
- And on my turf?!

163
Hey. Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.

164
He's coming from Jersey.
He said he'd get here as fast as he could.

165
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

166
- The police!
- Oh!

167
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.

168
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?

169
Whew, that's a lot of stairs.

170
Oh, boy. You should warn people
there's no elevator.

171
I should not have had
that Mexican food for lunch.

172
- Oh.
- Are you gonna be okay, Officer, uh?

173
- Goodbody.
- If you say so.

174
So where's the young lady...

175
...who I am supposed to take
downtown?

176
Oh, God.

177
All right. Somebody show me
where to plug in my box...

178
...and we'll get this party started.

179
Wah!

180
- Over here?
- Yeah.

181
- All right.
- Rachel?

182
- Yeah?
- Um, are you kidding?

183
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
so we got the phone book...

184
...and got the first name we could find.
- How old's your phone book?

185
Oh, my God, this man is gonna
get naked in my apartment.

186
God, no. I don't wanna see him
take his clothes off.

187
Are you talking about me?

188
Oh, no.

189
I mean, obviously we wanna see you
take your clothes off.

190
You big piece of eye candy.

191
Okay. Okay, ladies,
can I have your attention, please?

192
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

193
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

194
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.

195
I hope you're familiar
with this state's penal code.

196
Okay, okay. Enough teasing.

197
Now for some pleasing.

198
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

199
Sometimes I feel I've got to

200
Run away
I've got to get away

201
From the pain you drive
Into the heart of me

202
The love we share
Seems to go

203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

204
She cringed.

205
This is how I look when I'm turned on.

206
You were talking about me before.

207
Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here.
Where's my hat?

208
Look, I've been in this business
for a long time.

209
Shocking.

210
Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
I'll be on my way.

211
- $300? Are you kidding?
- That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.

212
You're not gonna pay him.
He didn't do anything.

213
Didn't do anything? I took a bus
all the way from Hoboken.

214
I climbed, I don't know,
like, a billion stairs.

215
And it's not like I can
take them two at a time.

216
I don't care.
We're not paying you $300 for this.

217
It's not my fault if you're
too uptight to appreciate...

218
...the male form in all its glory.

219
Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
wanna watch a middle-aged guy...

220
...dance around in what I can only
assume is a child's Halloween costume.

221
I may have borrowed this
from my nephew...

222
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.

223
I'm sorry, did you say "all man"
or "old man"?

224
Whoa!

225
You're mean.

226
- Uh, look, uh, officer, um... Sir?
- Damn it.

227
Listen.

228
Big surprise.
The hunk of beef has feelings.

229
Applause.

230
Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."

231
Oh. My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.

232
Joey, describe these things associated
with the United States Congress.

233
Give me 20 seconds
on the clock, please.

234
Ready? Go.

235
Uh... Uh...

236
Pass.

237
- Uh, the thing hanging in your throat.
- Uvula.

238
Oh, then pass.

239
Aw...

240
Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
all the points you needed...

241
...so that means, Gene, you are going to
the Winner's Circle to try for $10,000.

242
And you're gonna be
going there with Joey Tribbiani.

243
You made out with Missy Goldberg?

244
How could you do that
after you promised me?

245
Excuse me.

246
That didn't make us sound gay at all.

247
- You broke the pact.
- Ross, that was 16 years ago.

248
That doesn't matter. We're talking
about the foundation of our friendship.

249
I believe the foundation of our friendship
was unfortunate hair.

250
If we're really gonna do this, it's not
like you never broke one of the pacts.

251
- I didn't.
- Oh, really?

252
- No.
- Oh, really?

253
- No!
- Adrienne Turner!

254
Yes?

255
Hey, Adrienne.

256
Hey.

257
I never did anything
with Adrienne Turner.

258
Oh, please. And you knew
how much I liked her.

259
I don't know
what you're talking about.

260
Really? Remember
that party freshman year?

261
A week before Christmas vacation?

262
I do.

263
You had some visitors.

264
I can't believe we're
at a real college party.

265
I have to pee so bad.

266
This is so awesome.

267
College guys are so cute.

268
- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
- I know.

269
But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim
wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.

270
Hey, look, there's Chandler.

271
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.

272
- I've already lost four pounds.
- You can so totally tell.

273
I know!

274
Well, let's see,
maybe he knows where Ross is.

275
Der Kommissar's in town, uh-oh

276
Hey, how's it going?

277
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, Rachel.

278
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.

279
Right. So how you doing?

280
Bitchen.

281
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Chandler.

282
It's really nice to see you. Not!

283
Okay.

284
I'll see if I can find Ross.

285
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.

286
Oh.

287
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.

288
Don't turn around, uh-oh

289
Listen, Adrienne,
you can't tell Chandler about this.

290
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.

291
Cool.

292
Don't turn around, uh-oh

293
Der Kommissar's in town

294
I didn't know you knew about that.

295
Well, I did. And it hurt.

296
That's when I wrote the song
"Betrayal in the Common Room."

297
Man, I'm sorry.

298
Look, that was a long time ago.

299
So, I made out with Adrienne,
and you made out with Missy.

300
Well, I guess we're even.

301
Mm-hm.

302
We are even, right?

303
One more thing. I was so pissed at you
that night, I wanted to get back at you.

304
So I thought, "Who does Ross
like more than anybody?"

305
What did you do to my mom?

306
Not her.

307
Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about movin'

308
Gotta move on

309
I am so drunk.

310
Gotta move on

311
That's weird. I've had the same number
of beers as you and I don't feel anything.

312
So you girls having fun?

313
For your information, ass-munch...

314
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five with all the dancing.

315
- Somebody order a pizza?
- Oh, that's me!

316
Won't you take me to
Funkytown?

317
I am so not gonna do good
on my SATs tomorrow.

318
Well, maybe you could go to school here
next year and we could totally hang out.

319
Oh, yeah. There's a plan.

320
Why don't I just start taking
my smart pills now?

321
Well, maybe you could get in
on a beauty scholarship.

322
What a line.

323
Oh, my God.

324
- So where are you applying to?
- Um, well...

325
...I think it's kind of really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun.

326
So I'm sort of... Hey!

327
I'm in college and I'm in a band.

328
Yeah, okay.

329
Won't you take me to
Funkytown?

330
What's the matter? You never saw
a 50-year-old stripper cry before?

331
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.

332
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?

333
I should have hung up
that breakaway jockstrap years ago.

334
What am I gonna do? I mean...

335
...this has been my life for 32 years.

336
Taking my clothes off
in front of people is all I know.

337
No, there's gotta be something else
that you can do.

338
I mean, what skills do you have?

339
I don't know.

340
I can make my pecs dance.

341
I can pick up a dollar bill
with my butt cheeks.

342
I can go to that special place
inside me where I feel no shame.

343
So maybe something in an office.

344
Or you could...
You could teach stripping.

345
You know, share your gift.
Pass the torch.

346
You know, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

347
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.

348
There you go. Okay.
You think you're gonna be okay?

349
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

350
This is so weird.

351
You never know when it's gonna be
your last dance.

352
And I didn't even get a chance
to finish it.

353
Finish it.

354
- What?
- Your last dance. Do it for us.

355
- Really?
- Really?

356
Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
the thing he loves one last time.

357
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.

358
Okay.

359
Whoa, you make me feel

360
Whoo!

361
Mighty real

362
You make me feel

363
Mighty real

364
Oh, this is so hot!

365
Oh, no, no, no, don't stop.

366
- Have to.
- Oh.

367
I feel real

368
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?

369
- Yeah.
- Sure.

370
Okay. Uh, give me 60 seconds
on the clock, please.

371
Ready? Go.

372
Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.

373
Uh, I don't know. Types of trees?

374
Enchilada.

375
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I don't know any Spanish words.

376
Wow.

377
A match. A candle.

378
Things that go "tss"
when you put them out.

379
- A torch. A bonfire.
- Uh, I...

380
- Uh, your pee.
- Things that burn.

381
"I'd like to go for a walk."
Uh, "scratch my belly."

382
Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.

383
Uh, "I have fur." Uh, "I like to bark."

384
Oh, oh, oh! What a dog says.

385
- Uh, pepperoni.
- Pizza toppings! Next!

386
Cindy Crawford. Uh, Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum. Claudia Schiffer.

387
Oh, oh, oh. Uh...

388
Christy Turlington. Uh, Kate Moss.

389
Girls Chandler could never get?

390
- Supermodels.
- Where?

391
Hey. Where's Rachel?

392
She and Phoebe took the stripper
to the hospital.

393
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

394
What? When was this?

395
1987. The weekend you guys
visited me at school.

396
- Oh, my God. That's wild.
- But it was, like, a million years ago.

397
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

398
- Why?
- Because the night you kissed Rachel...

399
...was the night I kissed Rachel
for the very first time.

400
- You kissed her that night too?
- Two guys in one night?

401
Wow, I thought she became a slut
after she got her nose fixed. Wow.

402
- Seriously, where did this happen?
- Okay...

403
...after you told me she was
passed out in our room...

404
...I went in there to make sure
she was all right.

405
She was lying on my bed,
all buried in people's coats.

406
I went to kiss her on the forehead...

407
...but it was so dark,
I accidentally got her lips.

408
I started to pull away, but then
I felt her start to kiss me back.

409
It was only for a second,
but it was amazing.

410
And now I find out
that you kissed her first.

411
- Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
- Mine.

412
- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.

413
Why would I kiss a girl
and then put her on your bed?

414
Well, then who was on my bed?

415
Oh! Oh! Oh!

416
No! No! No!

417
Yes!

418
- You were under the pile of coats?
- I was the pile of coats!

419
Oh, my God!

420
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!

421
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!

422
You were my first kiss ever?!

423
What did I marry into?!

424
Aw, crap!

425
Burn, baby, burn

﻿1
- Oh, hey, Joey.
- Mmm.

- Hey.
- Listen, I need to ask you something.

3
You know how my stepdad's in prison?

4
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

5
He was supposed to get a weekend
furlough so he could go to the wedding.

6
But he just called and...

7
Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the
exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.

8
- So he can't come?
- No.

9
And so there's no one to walk me
down the aisle. And...

10
Well, I would just really love it
if you would do it.

11
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

12
You've, you know,
sort of been like a dad to me.

13
You've always, you know, looked out
for me and shared your wisdom.

14
I am pretty "wisdomous."

15
So, what do you say?

16
Are you kidding?
Phoebe, I would be honored.

17
Oh, thank you.

18
I hope...

19
I hope you know how much
you mean to me.

20
Listen, I hope...

21
I hope that you know...

22
I don't want you to see your father cry.
Go to your room!

23
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.

24
Oh. It's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy!

25
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!

26
Okay, so halibut.

27
All right, so salmon.
Either way. I don't...

28
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Well, it matters to me!

29
Well, I don't care. So you pick.

30
Did you just hang up on me?

31
All right, look, I need you at the
rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.

32
Okay. What time is that?

33
You don't know military time?

34
I must have been in missile training
the day they taught that.

35
Just subtract 12.

36
Okay, so 1800 minus 12...

37
...is 1788.

38
- Six o'clock!
- Okay.

39
Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.

40
No, I said it has to be there
by 4:00. Goodbye.

41
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?

42
That sounds really fancy.

43
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.

44
Please, honey, leave the details to me.

45
Now, I wanna make this day
as special for you as I can.

46
I was thinking the harpist
should wear white.

47
Harpist? My friend Marjorie
is playing the steel drums.

48
- Oh, she backed out.
- She did? Why?

49
I made her.

50
Steel drums don't really say
"elegant wedding."

51
- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
- Hey!

52
She will shower when Tibet is free.

53
- Hey. You look great.
- You too.

54
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
I rarely practice my meals before I eat.

55
What did we say
was your one gift to us?

56
No stupid jokes, but I thought
that was for the actual wedding.

57
Rehearse it.

58
Hi.

59
- Thanks for coming, you guys.
- Oh, yeah...

60
I was...
I was going for a handshake.

61
That why your hand's
against my crotch?

62
- That is why.
- Yeah.

63
So, Rach, where's Emma?

64
Monica made me send her
to my mom's.

65
Apparently, babies and weddings
don't mix.

66
Are you still crying about
your damn baby?

67
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
Remember, 20 seconds per person.

68
You see these clowns all the time.

69
- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
- Yes, we are.

70
Gosh, our little ones
are growing up fast, aren't they?

71
- How's that?
- You know...

72
...on one hand, you're happy for them.
On the other, it's hard to let go.

73
Who in God's name are you?

74
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.

75
You know what? We have no idea what
we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.

76
I thought we'd be groomsmen.
They would have asked us by now.

77
When did they ask you
to be a bridesmaid?

78
- November.
- I wanna say it's not looking good.

79
- Hey, Pheebs?
- Huh?

80
You haven't told these guys
what they're doing in the wedding yet.

81
Um, well, they're not in the wedding.

82
What?

83
Well...

84
...this is really awkward.

85
Oh, and I can leave.

86
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
his brother and his friends from school.

87
So, you know, you were...

88
If it helps, you were next in line.
You just missed the cut.

89
Oh, man.

90
This is like figure skating team
all over again.

91
I mean, synchronized swimming.

92
I mean...
I mean, the balance beam.

93
- Help me.
- Football.

94
Thank you.

95
Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
That has pork in it.

96
Oh! Oh!

97
I thought the pot stickers
were supposed to be vegetarian?

98
Yeah, I changed them.
I sent you a fax about it.

99
I don't have a fax machine.

100
Huh. Well, then there are gonna be
a few surprises.

101
I can't believe we're gonna be
the only people not in the wedding.

102
- I know. I hate being left out of things.
- And it's a wedding.

103
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.

104
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Fine.

105
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.

106
Look, about tomorrow,
I've got a question for you.

107
I found out one of my groomsmen
had an emergency and can't make it.

108
- What happened?
- Who cares? And?

109
And I was wondering
if one of you guys...

110
- I'll do it!
- Me!

111
You both wanna do it?
There's only room for one.

112
Pick me. I look great in a tux,
and I won't steal focus.

113
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
I mean... Watch.

114
Huh?

115
You know, I really don't feel
very comfortable making this decision.

116
You know, Phoebe knows you better.
I'm gonna let her choose.

117
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
hello to Mike's next groomsman.

118
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...

119
...as he is me.

120
- Please. You're going down.
- You are going "downer."

121
They say that on
the figure skating team?

122
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.

123
You know I'm filling in
for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?

124
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
- Oh, hey, my pleasure.

125
So, what are your intentions
with my Phoebe?

126
- I intend to marry her.
- Oh, a wiseacre.

127
I understand you plan to support
your wife by playing the piano?

128
Isn't that kind of unstable?

129
- No more so than acting.
- Strike two.

130
You're right.
She probably will support me.

131
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.

132
Strike three.

133
You only get one more, Mike.

134
So? What did you decide?

135
I decided to pee.

136
You have to choose one of us
to be in your wedding.

137
- One of the groomsmen fell out.
- Oh, no, no.

138
I can't choose between you two.
I love you both so much.

139
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.

140
But I don't wanna choose.
It's...

141
- Okay, wait. Rach?
- Yeah?

142
Listen, I have a very special
bridesmaid task for you to do.

143
Goody! What is it?

144
Well, there's a spot open
for only one groomsman...

145
...and you have to choose between Ross
and Chandler. So good luck with that.

146
What? What, what, what?
No, I don't wanna do that.

147
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.

148
I'll do it!

149
Okay, it's 2100 hours.

150
- Time for your toast.
- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?

151
You had a bathroom break at 2030.
Pee on your own time, Mike.

152
In regards to the toasts, okay,
you wanna keep them short.

153
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner
like long speeches. Okay.

154
You just get in, do your thing,
and get out.

155
Is that what you say to Chandler?

156
It's 2101, and I am not amused.

157
Okay.

158
The bride and groom
have a few words they'd like to say.

159
Okay. Hello, everyone.

160
And thank you all for being here tonight.
So tomorrow's the big event.

161
Some of you might not know, but Mike
and I didn't get off to the best start.

162
Yeah. My friend Joey and I...

163
...decided to fix each other up
with friends. So I...

164
Oh, okay. I...

165
I thought about it, and I fixed him up
with my friend Mary Ellen...

166
...who couldn't be here tonight,
because... It's not...

167
It's not important.
Well, she's in rehab.

168
Anyway. So Joey said that he was
fixing me up with his friend Mike...

169
...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
so he just brought my Mike. And... And...

170
But despite, you know...
It got good.

171
I wanna take a moment to mention
my mother, who couldn't be here.

172
Oh, God.

173
And... And moment's over.

174
So okay... Oh, no, forget that.

175
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.

176
Oh, but you need to know that
to get that.

177
So... Oh, well, okay.

178
I... Okay.

179
Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!

180
This is my wedding, okay?
I don't want this...

181
Or this... Or this...

182
Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...

183
...where my fiancé can go
to the bathroom any time he wants!

184
- You know what? You're done.
- What?

185
You're fired!

186
Cheers.

187
- Hey.
- Happy wedding day.

188
Happy my wedding day to you.

189
Joey, listen, this is gonna be
bridesmaid central, all right?

190
We're gonna have hair and makeup
in the bathroom.

191
I had to move a couple things in the
fridge to make room for the corsages.

192
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
if I knew there was gonna be corsages.

193
Hi.

194
About last night...

195
I know you're under
a lot of stress, and...

196
Well, even though the things you said
hurt me a little bit...

197
My point is...

198
Well, I'm willing to take my job back.

199
Oh, well, that's okay.

200
I think you and I will do much better
if you're just here as a bridesmaid.

201
Oh, is that so?

202
Okay.

203
If that's really what you want,
then here.

204
I give you the headset. I don't really
wanna give you the headset.

205
I guess if you're taking over, then you
should probably return these messages.

206
- This is a lot.
- Uh-huh.

207
But I'm sure you can handle this.
I have won awards...

208
...for my organizational skills.
But I'm sure you'll do fine.

209
- You've won awards?
- I printed them out on my computer.

210
- Hey.
- Hi.

211
- Where's Rach?
- She's in her room. Why?

212
I have to talk to her
about this groomsman situation.

213
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm in the seats like some chump.

214
My God, you're breathtaking.

215
What do you want?

216
You haven't by any chance
chosen a groomsman yet, have you?

217
Ross, please don't make this
harder than it already is.

218
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.

219
- Chandler said it's important to him too.
- Listen. Listen.

220
Whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.

221
Now, I promise I won't say a word.
But if you pick Chandler...

222
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
in your ear the whole time.

223
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.

224
Yes!

225
Sven, I don't understand what you're
saying. What is wrong with the flowers?

226
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?

227
I know.

228
- Hey.
- Mike, if you were Swedish...

229
...and you were saying the word
"lorkins," what flower would that be?

230
- Orchids?
- Right there!

231
That's why I'm marrying you.

232
Hello, Michael.

233
Joseph.

234
May I have a word with you, please?

235
This is...

236
...great.

237
Have a seat.

238
Last night...

239
...I tried to welcome you into my family.

240
And instead, you disrespect me.

241
I cannot allow this.

242
Are you rehearsing
for some really bad Mafia movie?

243
More back talk.

244
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
from my recent unsuccessful audition...

245
...for Family Honor 2:
This A-Time It's A-Personal.

246
Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today.
What do you want?

247
I want you to take this seriously!

248
Phoebe is very,
very important to me, okay?

249
I wanna make sure
you are gonna take care of her.

250
Joe, I love Phoebe.

251
She's the most important thing
in my life.

252
I'd die before I let
anything happen to her.

253
That's what I wanted to hear.

254
Because she's family, okay?

255
And now you're gonna be family.

256
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.

257
That must have been one lousy movie.

258
That was me!

259
- Hi.
- Let's talk about this groomsman thing.

260
If you pick Ross, he'll walk you
down the aisle just fine.

261
But if you choose me...

262
...you'll be getting some comedy.

263
Even so...

264
...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.

265
Let me tell you
why you need to pick me.

266
Okay.

267
See, when I was a kid, you know,
I was always left out of everything...

268
...and it really made me feel insecure.

269
I was always picked last in gym...

270
...even behind that fat exchange student
who didn't know the rules to baseball.

271
I mean, this guy would strike out
and then run to third.

272
Anyway, if I'm the only one
left out of this wedding...

273
...I just know that all those feelings
are gonna come rushing back.

274
All right, fine, I pick you.

275
Yes!

276
Make "groom" for Chandler.

277
Oh, my.

278
No, we're gonna do it my way.
Because your way is stupid.

279
All right, I got to go.
I have another call, Reverend.

280
Hello?

281
- I'm glad we had this little talk.
- Yes.

282
And thanks for all
the wedding night advice.

283
That didn't make me
uncomfortable at all.

284
All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.

285
- Okay.
- Bye.

286
Did you guys know that there's
a giant ice sculpture in the hall?

287
Oh, my God, what's it doing here?

288
I guess it got sent to the billing address
as opposed to the shipping address.

289
- What a pickle.
- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.

290
Why is this happening to me?

291
How bad do you wanna
stick your tongue on that?

292
- How's it going?
- Good.

293
I'm just getting some coffee
so I'm alert for the wedding.

294
That's what I was doing too.

295
Well, you have fun tonight.

296
- You too.
- Oh, I will.

297
Me too.

298
Wait a minute. I know why I'm being
such an ass. Why are you?

299
- I'm not supposed to tell you.
- I'm not supposed to tell you.

300
You told us both
we could be in the wedding?

301
In my defense, you weren't
supposed to tell each other!

302
Rachel, only one of us can do it.
You have to choose.

303
You and me together again.

304
Rach, Rach? Knock-knock.

305
- Who's there?
- I'll tell you at the wedding.

306
Hey, I forgot my scarf.

307
I can't do this. I don't know
which one of you guys to pick.

308
Oh, you haven't picked yet?
Oh, good, because I had an idea.

309
I thought it would be fun if the third
groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.

310
What? A dog?
No. Rachel gets to choose.

311
Wow, this is a tough one.

312
I think I'm gonna have to go
with the dog.

313
So, what you're saying is
that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...

314
...but the food is not? And the drinks
are there but the bartender is not?

315
Are you freaking kidding me?

316
How's it going?

317
- Help me.
- What?

318
I want you to be crazy bitch again.

319
Really?

320
Please?

321
- You really want me to come back?
- More than I wanna get married.

322
Okay, people, we are back in business!

323
Oh, God, I have missed you
so much. Okay.

324
Get your hair and makeup done.
I'll take care of everything.

325
- Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
- About what?

326
The blizzard.
I just saw on the news...

327
...it's the worst snowstorm
in 20 years.

328
They already closed
all the bridges and tunnels.

329
But the band and the photographer
are coming in from New Jersey.

330
I don't think they are.

331
Ha-ha! Looks like you're not gonna be
in the wedding, either.

332
So sorry, Pheebs.

333
- Well, the club lost its power.
- The news said most of the city did.

334
- Since when do you watch the news?
- For your information...

335
...since they hired
a very hot weather girl.

336
I can't believe you aren't
getting married today.

337
I know.

338
It's so beautiful out there. You always
wanted to get married outside.

339
- Why don't you just do it on the street?
- What?

340
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.

341
I mean, you couldn't ask
for a more romantic setting.

342
This could be the simple wedding
you've always wanted.

343
What do you think?

344
I think I wanna get married to you today.

345
Me too. Monica, do you think
we could do it?

346
Affirmative!

347
Okay, let's get these chairs out here!

348
Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.

349
Ah.

350
Okay, who left the ice sculpture
on the steam grate?

351
- Michael.
- Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!

352
- There you go.
- Hi. Hi.

353
I know getting married in the street
isn't what you approve of.

354
No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow.
I could look at them forever.

355
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.

356
Come on, sweetheart.

357
You know, Chappy's too small
to handle all this snow.

358
Someone has to
walk him down the aisle.

359
- Would this person be in the wedding?
- I guess.

360
- I'll do it!
- I'll do it!

361
Chandler, hello?
I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?

362
I'm not scared.
I'll just take little Chappy and...

363
He can sense my fear!
My throat is exposed!

364
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then.

365
He stinks.

366
Level one alert! I repeat,
level one, this is not a drill!

367
We have a situation. The minister called.
He's snowed in, he can't make it.

368
- Oh, no.
- Hey, don't worry.

369
- I'm still ordained from your wedding.
- Really?

370
Yeah. You think I'd give up being
a minister and pay to ride the subway?

371
Ministers don't ride the subway for free.

372
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully,
but, yeah, we do.

373
We have to find someone else
to walk Phoebe down the aisle.

374
I'll do it!

375
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.

376
Chandler, come with me.

377
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony,
and Chandler's giving you away.

378
Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.

379
- So you ready to do this?
- Oh, my God. This is really happening.

380
- Uh-huh. I'm so happy for you, honey.
- Thank you.

381
I love you.
Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!

382
- Oh, what the hell.
- Oh, come on.

383
- I love you guys.
- I love you.

384
Okay, it's zero hour!
All teams execute on my count!

385
Let's get this bad boy on the road!

386
Is it okay I want you
to wear that headset in bed?

387
I have you scheduled for nudity
at 2300 hours.

388
Oh, yeah.

389
Okay, Marjorie, hit it.

390
- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered.
- It's the dog.

391
Groomsman? Why are you standing
there? Where's your bridesmaid?

392
We've got a broken arrow!
Bridesmaid down!

393
Oh, that's me.

394
- Ready?
- Okay.

395
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.

396
Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?

397
I don't care.

398
I'll be my "something blue."

399
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

400
My God.

401
- Aren't you freezing?
- Nuh-uh.

402
Friends. Family.

403
Dog.

404
Thank you all for being here
to witness this blessed event.

405
The cold has now spread
to my special place...

406
...so I'm gonna do
the short version of this.

407
Phoebe and Mike
are perfect for each other.

408
And I know I speak for everyone here...

409
...when I wish them
a lifetime of happiness.

410
Who has the rings?

411
Okay.

412
When I was growing up,
I didn't have a normal mom and dad...

413
...or a regular family like everybody else.

414
And I always knew
that something was missing.

415
But now I'm standing here today...

416
...knowing that I have everything
I'm ever gonna need.

417
You are my family.

418
Phoebe, you are so beautiful.

419
You're so kind. You're so generous.

420
You're so wonderfully weird.

421
Every day with you is an adventure.

422
And I can't believe how lucky I am.

423
And I can't wait
to share my life with you forever.

424
Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...

425
...I love you.

426
And you have nice eyes.

427
I love you too.

428
- Joey?
- Yeah?

429
Chappy's heart rate
has slowed way down.

430
Okay. Phoebe...

431
...do you take this man
to be your husband?

432
I do.

433
Oh...

434
Mike, do you take this woman
to be your wife?

435
I do.

436
I now pronounce you...

437
...husband and wife.

438
I got married!

439
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm frigging freezing.

440
- It really was an incredible wedding.
- It was.

441
I kind of don't want it to end.
Hey...

442
...you wanna come in for a drink
and a bite of corsage?

443
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours...

444
...and I'm about to have the most
organized sex anyone's ever had.

445
- Whatever happened to Ross?
- I don't know.

446
Maybe he hooked up with that
hot girl he talked to.

447
Come on, Chappy! Do your business!
Make!

448
Make!

449
I did not sign on for this.

﻿1
Hi!

2
- Hey!
- Hey! Welcome back!

3
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!

4
Oh, champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.

5
- It was so romantic.
- Oh.

6
- So where's Mike?
- Oh, he's at the doctor.

7
He didn't poop while we were there.

8
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?

9
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...

10
...which, according to my résumé,
I'm fluent in.

11
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.

12
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?

13
It was okay.

14
I did not know you spoke French.

15
Oh, oh, you're so sexy.

16
- Well, so will you help me?
- Sure.

17
Ha, ha, seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.

18
- Hey.
- Hi.

19
Why are you wearing my apron?

20
I'm making cookies for Erica.

21
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.

22
When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...

23
...and the woman who's
carrying my child, ha, ha?

24
No?

25
Divorce?

26
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
- Uh, you know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.

28
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.

29
- Hey!
- Hey!

30
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?

31
Well, I want the baby to come out
all cute and fat!

32
- So, uh, why is Erica coming to visit?
- We wanna get to know her better.

33
And, uh, she's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:

34
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

35
Oh, there's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

36
And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

37
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?

38
Oh, hi! Hi!

39
- Thanks for showing up 30 minutes late.
- Ross.

40
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?

41
Uh, a mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?

42
My father had a heart attack.

43
While I was at Barneys.

44
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?

45
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, is he okay?

46
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.

47
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long Island with you.

48
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.

49
I don't need you to come.

50
- I can totally handle this on my own.
- Still, still, let me come for me.

51
Okay. If you really need to.

52
I bet someone could use one
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.

53
- Oh, I really could.
- Oh.

54
Oh.

55
All right, it seems pretty simple.

56
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."

57
- Okay.
- So just repeat after me.

58
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.

59
Huh. It's not...

60
...quite what I'm saying.

61
Really?
Sounds exactly the same to me.

62
- It does, really?
- Yeah.

63
- Let's just try it again.
- Okay.

64
- Really listen.
- Got it.

65
Okay.

66
Hey, you guys!

67
- Hi.
- Hey!

68
I want you to meet
someone really special.

69
- Phoebe, this is Erica.
- Hi.

70
- And this is the baby!
- Oh, hi.

71
- Joey, EHca, baby.
- Hi.

72
Everyone, Erica! Baby!

73
- Monica. Calm. Self.
- Ha, ha.

74
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.

75
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

76
Well, welcome to New York City,
or should I say:

77
...New York City.

78
Why would you say that?

79
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?

80
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center.

81
You should walk to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

82
- Oh, yeah, let's do that.
- Great.

83
This baby better be really good.

84
Hi, um, uh, excuse me, I'm here to see
my father. My name is Rachel Green.

85
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.

86
That actually means something here.

87
- So can we please go in?
- Absolutely.

88
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...

89
...because, uh, my throat is feeling a
little scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

90
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.

91
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
- I'm feeling better.

92
Oh, my God.

93
Oh, oh, wow.

94
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

95
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

96
Oh, great.
Um, are you gonna be okay?

97
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.

98
- Uh, did the TV wake you?
- No.

99
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.

100
Ouchy.

101
What are you doing here, Geller?

102
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.

103
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.

104
Right. Is it painful?

105
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

106
Let's see if we can get
that Rachel back in here.

107
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?

108
Nope. Just the one. Rachel!

109
No!

110
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.

111
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.

112
Great! Okay, faster.

113
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?

114
I have to go before I put your head
through a wall.

115
No, no. Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!

116
- Hey.
- Hi.

117
I was gonna make us some dinner...

118
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

119
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

120
- Did you call your parents?
- Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.

121
Oh, good.

122
Wow.

123
What?

124
I just can't believe
I'm in Rachel Green's room.

125
- You've been in my room before.
- Hah, yeah, sure, right. Ha, ha.

126
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.

127
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

128
- Oh, ha, ha.
- Sorry.

129
- You okay?
- Yeah.

130
- Yeah, you had a rough day, huh?
- Yeah.

131
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

132
You don't expect doctors to get sick.

133
But we do.

134
Well, he's gonna be okay, Rach.

135
Aw.

136
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.

137
- What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
- What?

138
They gave him a lot of medication.

139
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

140
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

141
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No... God, hey.

142
Rach, you've been an
amazing daughter, okay?

143
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

144
Good night.

145
Wait, wait, wait.

146
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?

147
- Sure.
- Okay.

148
- Thank you for coming with me today.
- Oh, of course.

149
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.

150
- Me too. Come here.
- No.

151
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

152
Okay, well, um, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or...

153
No, Rach!

154
I'm sorry, I just don't
think this is a good idea.

155
Well, we won't know that
until we do it, will we?

156
No, um, uh, look, um.

157
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...

158
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.

159
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.

160
What...? Taking advantage?
I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!

161
Look, I'm sure it would be great...

162
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.

163
So I'm gonna go.

164
Wow.

165
Okay.

166
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm-hm.

167
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!

168
Thanks so much for taking me
to all those places. I had a great time.

169
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize
about Chandler, though.

170
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!

171
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...

172
...but I've never really seen them.

173
Yeah, you miss a lot
when you're mooing.

174
- Thanks so much for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

175
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.

176
Well, if there's anything else
you wanna know...

177
Oh, uh...

178
Okay, um.

179
Can we ask you some
questions about the father?

180
Oh, sure. Yeah.

181
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

182
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.

183
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

184
How's that, now?

185
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.

186
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...

187
...but they sort of overlapped.

188
So, what does the other guy do?

189
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.

190
Oh.

191
Well, um,
was he falsely accused of something?

192
No.

193
He killed his father with a shovel.

194
Other than that, he's a great guy.

195
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

196
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

197
Assume from now on
that I'm always awake.

198
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

199
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.

200
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.

201
Would we not want the baby? No.

202
- Would we treat him any differently?
- I'd keep an eye on him.

203
We have to find out
which the father is.

204
- How?
- I don't know.

205
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yeah, but maybe we're overreacting.

206
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.

207
He probably loves his mommy.

208
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

209
We'll now count from one to five.

210
Good job.
- Thank you.

211
- Hey.
- Hey, JOEY-

212
Listen, I feel really badly about
yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.

213
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.

214
That's okay. I don't need your help.

215
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say, I am pretty good.

216
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.

217
Okay. Ahem.

218
See?

219
Right, but you're not...

220
You're not... You're...

221
Again, you're not speaking French!

222
Oh, well, I think I am! Yeah, and I think
I'm definitely gonna get the part!

223
How could you possibly think that?

224
The guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

225
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?

226
Sure.

227
You've been quiet all morning.
ls everything okay?

228
Mm-hm.

229
- You sure you're all right?
- Yep.

230
Okay. Um.

231
Well, I'm gonna go, uh,
grab us some breakfast.

232
- FYI.
- There it is.

233
In the future, when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

234
Wait, wait, you're, uh, mad at me
about last night?

235
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- Really?

236
If you had done the right thing...

237
...I wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.

238
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.

239
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!

240
I can't believe this!
I was just being a good guy.

241
I treated you with
respect and understanding.

242
Oh, that is so hot.

243
Hey, I was looking out for you.

244
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
lam a big girl.

245
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.

246
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot
of times before. This is the worst ever!

247
Oh, oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

248
Oh, okay, you know...?
Hey, hey, you know what?

249
To avoid this little thing
in the future...

250
...let's just say, you and me?
Never having sex again.

251
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!

252
I am never having sex with you again!

253
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

254
- Hey! How was lunch?
- We had a good time.

255
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

256
It would really mean a lot to me
if the baby was a boy...

257
...that you name him after my father...

258
...Jiminy Billy Bob.

259
- Oh, really?
- No! Ha, ha.

260
- You were right. That was fun.
- Ha-ha-ha.

261
I'm gonna go finish packing.

262
- Okay.
- Ha, ha.

263
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.

264
- I found out who the father is.
- Oh, God.

265
- It's Shovely Joe, isn't it'?
- No, it's not.

266
How do you know?

267
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed. class...

268
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?

269
It'd be pretty hard to make
a baby that way.

270
Oh, God, what was it? The thing we
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?

271
The thing we never do.

272
Shovely Joe.

273
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right. Ahem.

274
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.

275
Joey, do you speak French?

276
You know what?
I think this audition is over.

277
Uh, excuse me?

278
Uh, I am Régine Phalange.

279
Uh, I was passing by when
I heard this man speaking...

280
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estée Lauder.

281
You really think this man
is speaking French?

282
Good job, little buddy.

283
That was some really good French.

284
But I think we're gonna go
with someone else for the part.

285
- Oh, all right, but my French was good?
- It was great.

286
Oh, ha, ha, see?

287
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

288
- So, uh, I guess I'm gonna take oh'.
- Okay.

289
Hey, listen, uh, just before you go...

290
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.

291
Oh, no problem.

292
And also, you know, I, uh...

293
I was thinking about what you said, uh,
you know, about the whole sex thing...

294
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.

295
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

296
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.

297
Yeah.

298
Yeah, that's true.

299
Hey, um, do you remember
that one really great time?

300
- Oh, yeah!
- You know?

301
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.

302
Oh, yeah.

303
Well, I guess that's all
in the past now.

304
Mm-hm.

305
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

306
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...

307
- ...really bad.
- That's what we decided.

308
Yeah, ha, ha, that's right.

309
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
- Yeah.

310
When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...

311
Just seems like...

312
...such a...

313
...waste.

314
I hate waste.

315
- Ross?
- Yes?

316
Just so you know...

317
...with us...

318
...it's never off the table.

319
Damn it, it's never off the table.

320
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.

321
It's off the résumé.

322
- Archery?
- No.

323
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

324
You can drink a gallon of milk
in 10 seconds?

325
That I can do.

326
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

327
All right, watch me.

328
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- Ready, go!

329
You did it!

﻿1
Thank you guys for having us over.

2
- Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
- I don't know why we don't hang out...

3
- ...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...

4
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.

5
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.

6
Hey, you guys, I have great news.

7
- Ross, we're kind of in the middle of dinner.
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.

8
- Guess what happened at work today.
- A dinosaur died a million years ago?

9
Uh, try 65 million years ago.
And then try: Shh!

10
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.

11
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12
Do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?

13
I am gonna get laid.

14
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

15
Oh, Italian.

16
No one...
No one wanted seconds, right?

17
No, I'm good.

18
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.

19
I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
Gucci wants me.

20
- I'm up for tenure.
- Congratulations.

21
- You too. What are the odds?
- Oh...

22
Guess what.

23
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

24
I don't know who I'm happiest for.

25
I do. He's been working on that all day.

26
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?

27
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.

28
- Where'd you go to do it?
- Um, the...

29
The Ministry of Names...

30
...Bureau.

31
You never did it.

32
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of...

33
Of being an official Bing.

34
Hey, I will have you know that...

35
Ah, who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.

36
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37
Honey, would you want me
to take your name?

38
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.

39
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?

40
What, can't you see I'm
in the middle of something?

41
I like it.

42
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Joe.

43
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?

44
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...

45
...but you're the only one
who hasn't seen the house.

46
You'll see how close it is to the city.

47
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.

48
I couldn't even find that on the map.

49
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.

50
You know what? You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.

51
- I will come with you. Shotgun.
- Damn it.

52
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.

53
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.

54
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...

55
...to their stupid new house is to
point out everything wrong with it...

56
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.

57
You're a strange kind of grown-up.

58
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.

59
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and...

60
- Whoa. Can we not talk about that now?
- All right. Prude.

61
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.

62
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.

63
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?

64
I bet I could even get Mike
to do that thing. What is it'?

65
I am not gonna help you do that!

66
Oh, my God.

67
Hi. Um, I'm here to see Mr. Campbell,
with Gucci.

68
The reservation's probably under Gucci.

69
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.

70
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.

71
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.

72
I'm sorry, that's always
Mr. Campbell's table.

73
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.

74
- I know. With Gucky.
- Shh!

75
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.

76
That's great.

77
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough.
Single mom. Career.

78
You gotta get out there.

79
- Well, you've got a good energy.
- Oh.

80
- Rachel?
- Yes, hi.

81
- James Campbell.
- Hi.

82
- Excuse us.
- Please.

83
Okay.

84
Oh.

85
He's cute.

86
So...

87
...your resume is quite impressive.

88
My, ha, ha... My résumé?

89
I wouldn't... I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a résumé.

90
Dating profile? No, I'm...
I'm talking about the work résumé.

91
Whatever happened to just singing
for no reason?

92
Maybe people found it weird.

93
- Maybe.
- 80...

94
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?

95
- I don't.
- You don't?

96
No, I love... I love it there.

97
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?

98
That is my boss.

99
What?

100
That is my boss.

101
That's Hugo Boss?

102
God, this place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.

103
But you obviously haven't.

104
- How can I help you?
- I need to change my name, please.

105
See, I need to change it
because I'm hiding from the law.

106
You're fun.

107
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know...

108
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...

109
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

110
So is it supposed to be
"Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

111
- It can be anything you want.
- Well, not anything.

112
Yeah. Anything.

113
Oh, this could take a while.

114
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.

115
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

116
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.

117
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
- Wrong again.

118
Apparently,
you can change it to anything.

119
So I thought, "All right, here's an
opportunity to be creative."

120
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

121
That's what we were
gonna name the baby.

122
- Phoebe.
- Ah, Princess Consuela.

123
- You changed your name to that?
- Uh-huh.

124
Okay, so from now on, we have to call
you Princess Consuela?

125
No, I'm gonna have my friends
call me Valerie.

126
- Hey, how did the interview go?
- Ugh. Not good.

127
I always feel that way after an interview
I'll bet it went better than you think.

128
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

129
That is a bad interview.

130
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?

131
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...

132
...and he heard everything.

133
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...

134
...because I'm not a team player.

135
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

136
And then I had to sit there
for 45 minutes...

137
...while he proved that
that, in fact, was true.

138
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- God.

139
H93'-

140
What...? What's this?

141
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?

142
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...

143
...because I got tenure!

144
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

145
This is the single greatest day
of my professional career.

146
- Gunther. Six glasses.
- Six?

147
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

148
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.

149
Ooh. Israeli champagne.

150
And it's vanilla.

151
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.

152
Hey, Rach, so, uh,
how did your thing go?

153
Oh, good. But I won't hear about that
for a couple days.

154
Oh, you know what,
you're gonna get it. I can feel it.

155
Can you?

156
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.

157
And to years of hard work
finally paying off.

158
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.

159
But also knowing it means a lot.

160
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.

161
That center around work.

162
- To Ross.
- To Ross.

163
You know what the best part
about this is? I can never be fired.

164
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.

165
I have job security for life.

166
You know?
I mean, I never have to worry.

167
Oh, look at you.
Look how happy you are for me.

168
No, it's not that. I got fired today.

169
And I didn't get the other job.

170
- Oh, my... Rach, I'm so sorry.
- Oh...

171
- Great, I feel like an idiot.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

172
Little heads-up would've been nice.

173
Thank you for letting us
see the house again.

174
And thank you for explaining
to us what "escrow" means.

175
I've already forgotten what you said,
but thank you.

176
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.

177
Okay, thanks.

178
- Aw, so glad you decided to come.
- Me, too. Yeah, this place is great.

179
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.

180
- What?
- Fungus.

181
Yeah. Place is full of it.

182
No, it's not. We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.

183
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.

184
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out the window like a dog...

185
...the whole ride here.

186
Maybe.

187
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.

188
- No, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

189
I think I just saw a bat in the corner.

190
When your head was hanging out
the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

191
Maybe.

192
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?

193
Or any other house for that matter.

194
Oh, Joey.

195
We know you're having a hard
time with this, but we...

196
- We love it here.
- Fine! If you love this house so much...

197
...you should live here. I hope you
get used to that humming sound.

198
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...

199
...it's not.

200
- Hey.
- Hey.

201
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

202
- Oh, me too.
- So, what's new?

203
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.

204
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.

205
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

206
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

207
- You really did that?
- Yep.

208
You can't do that.

209
Why?

210
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.

211
Then I'm gonna change my name.

212
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?

213
Crap B39-

214
- Mike Crap Bag?
- No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."

215
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.

216
- You're not serious, right?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

217
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.

218
Uh-huh. Well, then great.
lfyouloveiLlloveiL

219
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.

220
And I love Crap.

221
Oh.

222
- Who are you?
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.

223
My stupid friends are buying this house.
Who are you?

224
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents
are selling this house.

225
I hate my parents.

226
I hate my friends.

227
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.

228
Like what?

229
Oh! Okay, you come with me and you
tell them that the house is haunted.

230
What are you, 8?

231
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas. I am 8.

232
Ah, there's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...

233
...if Monica and Chandler move out here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...

234
...that just leaves me and Ross and Rach.
You know what I mean?

235
I really don't.

236
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.

237
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.

238
You're young. Me? I'm set in my ways.

239
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.

240
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?

241
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

242
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it'?

243
Yeah. Maybe.

244
Then you've gotta let them go.

245
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're...

246
You're probably right.

247
How'd you get to be so smart?

248
I read a lot.

249
Just when I thought we could be friends.

250
Oh, hey, Rach. I just heard. I'm so sorry.

251
Oh, thank you...

252
You still don't know my name, do you?

253
Well, now I don't have to.

254
Ross, what is taking you so long?

255
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't
built for a quick getaway.

256
Rachel?

257
Mark? Oh, my God.

258
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.

259
- Sure. Sure.
- Oh.

260
What's with the chair?

261
Uh... You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so...

262
Clever.

263
So how are you?

264
Oh. You're not catching me
on my best day.

265
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't say "big promotion."

266
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...

267
- ...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?

268
We may have something
at Louis Vuitton.

269
Screw charity work. What do you got?

270
Why don't we have dinner and talk?

271
- Great. I'll call you.
- Okay.

272
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.

273
Oh, my God.

274
See? I told you something good
would come along.

275
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?

276
Ross, that's Mark.

277
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.

278
- That is Mark?
- Yes.

279
- I hate that guy.
- Oh...

280
No, no, no.
You cannot go to dinner with him.

281
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.

282
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."

283
I'm serious.
I just don't trust that guy, okay?

284
You know what...? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.

285
Oh, I love this street.

286
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.

287
Man, those two dogs are going at it.

288
H93'-

289
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, just, uh, you know, looking around.

290
But you know what?

291
This house is great.

292
Really? What changed your mind?

293
The little girl who lives here made me
feel better about the whole thing.

294
Joey? There was a little girl who lived here,
but she died, like, 30 years ago.

295
What?

296
I'm just messing with you.

297
That's not funny.
You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.

298
Joey, now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?

299
What?

300
I get my own room?

301
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?

302
Oh, my God.

303
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?

304
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

305
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.

306
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

307
Oh, hey!

308
- Oh, hi, Rita.
- How are you?

309
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.

310
Yeah.

311
Why don't you introduce me?

312
- Rita, this is my husband.
- Oh.

313
Why don't you tell her my name?

314
Okay, I will. This is, uh...
This is my husband, Crap Bag.

315
Crap Bag?

316
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

317
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

318
Ugh. Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
you please just be Mike Hannigan again?

319
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

320
How about, um...?
How about Buffay-Hannigan?

321
- Really?
- Yeah.

322
I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.

323
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?

324
It's a funny word.

325
It's a Speedo.

326
Oh, crap.

327
- Hey, is Rachel here?
- Nope.

328
She's still at dinner?

329
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...

330
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.

331
But I know he really wants
to sleep with her.

332
It's seven years ago.

333
My time machine works.

334
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.

335
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.

336
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.

337
Excuse me?

338
Oh, please.

339
Yesterday, on the subway,
you couldn't stop staring...

340
...at that woman with the big breasts.

341
For your information,
I was staring at her baby.

342
We're about to be parents.

343
Oh, sorry.

344
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...

345
- ...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.

346
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
could that smarmy letch possibly want?

347
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily married.
His wife just had twins.

348
Should we send something?

349
How did the job stuff go?

350
He offered me one.

351
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

352
I know, it's amazing.

353
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.

354
- The money is great.
- Can we...?

355
Can we just stop for a second? Who said
something better would come along? Huh?

356
You didn't believe me. I told you
everything was gonna work out.

357
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest.

358
The job is in Paris.

359
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...

360
...but am I missing opportunities?

361
You know, I've always thought of myself
as a serious actor.

362
Should I be trying to do more
independent movies?

363
I don't know.

364
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.

365
Hold on.

366
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.

﻿1
Previously on Friends:

2
- How did the job stuff go?
- He offered me one!

3
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of Israel's finest!

4
The job is in Paris.

5
Oh, God, please,
somebody say something.

6
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?

7
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

8
I know, it's huge, and it's scary
and it's really far, far away from you guys.

9
But this is such
an incredible opportunity for me.

10
And I've already told them about
our situation with Emma.

11
And they said they'll do whatever we need
to make us feel comfortable.

12
Okay.

13
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out. Anything we want.

14
My boss said I might be getting
a new lamp in my cubicle.

15
- All right. We'll work it out.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

16
Yeah.

17
- You sure this is what you want?
- I think it is.

18
- What's going on?
- I got a really incredible job offer.

19
- Hey, great! All right!
- Good for you!

20
- It's in Paris.
- What?

21
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, no, too much is changing, okay?

22
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.

23
And then these two move in
to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

24
- Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
- It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.

25
You guys, this is really,
really important to me.

26
It means a lot if you could try
to get on board.

27
- Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay!
- Thank you.

28
- Joey?
- No, no.No.

29
No, my hugs are reserved
for people staying in America.

30
- Joey, it would mean...
- Hey!

31
No! Get your France-going arms
away from me!

32
RACHEL
Joey.

33
- Are you okay with this?
- Well, it makes me feel sad, but...

34
- Talking to Ross.
- I see.

35
Rachel moving to another country?
Not being able to see her every day?

36
- How could I be okay with this?
- I know.

37
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.

38
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people
offered her her old job back...

39
...she would take it?

40
How's that gonna happen?

41
Is this the best way to use
one of your three magic wishes?

42
Like, I don't know,
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

43
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.

44
- The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
- I didn't say we were brothers!

45
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, tell me what you think.

46
The house next door to the one that
we're buying just went on the market.

47
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.

48
We close escrow tomorrow.

49
Seeing another house can only
confuse us. We're easily confused.

50
We're not very bright.

51
But what if it's better than ours?
Shouldn't we look?

52
What do you think, Pheebs?

53
Well, I think that shirt makes you look
like you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

54
Anyway...

55
- Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
- Yeah.

56
- She died.
- You're kidding.

57
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, last Saturday.

58
Wow! She was the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic.

59
- Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
- Oh, yeah?

60
- Yeah, she was just an agent.
- Joey's gonna be so upset.

61
I know. He always wanted to be
the first black man to cross the Atlantic.

62
We cannot tell Joey about this.

63
He's already flipping out
about everything that's changing.

64
This will push him over the edge.

65
- You don't think we should tell him?
- Not for a while.

66
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.

67
What if he reads it in the paper?

68
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
I think we're okay.

69
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

70
Um, actually, we met at the Christmas party
about two years ago.

71
- Oh, right. Don?
- Close. Ron.

72
Well, what can I do for you?

73
Um, well, I'm here to see
if you'll give Rachel her job back.

74
Ah, did she ask you
to come here and do this?

75
No. First I have to get you to agree...

76
...then we'll see
if she wants to come back.

77
Wow, that is tempting.

78
She loved her job here. Let's face it
you're not gonna find anyone...

79
...who did it as well as she did.
Isn't that true?

80
- She is good.
- Huh. I took a shot there.

81
But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

82
Oh, that's not true.
There's nothing I want to do.

83
I see.

84
- Thanks very much.
- Mm-hm.

85
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, his name is Ross.

86
- What?
- Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

87
Does he, um...? Does little Ross
like dinosaurs, by any chance?

88
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

89
How would he like to come with me
to the Museum of Natural History...

90
...after everyone else has left,
just the two of us...

91
...and he can touch anything he wants?

92
I just heard it how you must
have heard it, and that's not good.

93
Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.

94
You'll be there with us, and the touching
refers only to bones... Fossils!

95
- You could really arrange that?
- You let Rachel come back and it's done.

96
Well, I guess having Rachel back
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

97
Yes! Thank you! This is great!
Thank you so much.

98
I swear, your kid's gonna have
the time of his life.

99
That's great. I worry about little Ross.

100
He's always reading, collecting rocks
and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

101
He'll be fine!

102
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

103
- Everything okay?
- I'm just mad at my agent.

104
Estelle? Why?

105
There's a part in this TV movie
that I would be perfect for...

106
...and I didn't even get put up for it.
She better have a good reason.

107
I'm guessing she does.

108
Well, I wanna hear it,
because she keeps doing this.

109
No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.

110
Just listen. Promise me that you will
wait a minute before you call her.

111
Well, Okay. Why?

112
Because a promise between friends
means never having to give a reason.

113
I love that saying!

114
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

115
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.

116
It's a little coincidental, but believable.

117
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
why I didn't get you...

118
...an audition for that TV movie.

119
Yeah, actually I am.

120
I guess I dropped the ball there.
Whoopsie!

121
That's it? You know, it seems like
all you do lately is drop the ball.

122
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?

123
Alan Lemon, the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic?

124
No, look, all I'm saying is
you're my agent...

125
...and you're not getting me
any auditions and I'm tired of it.

126
What are you saying?

127
I'm saying that this isn't working
for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

128
You're fired. Goodbye.

129
Man, tough week for Estelle.

130
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
Um, Emma left her stuffed T. rex
at my house.

132
- You know she can't sleep without it.
- Ah. Well, she's asleep now.

133
- Stop forcing that thing on her.
- Okay.

134
Oh! You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today!

135
Ralph Lauren called
and gave me my job back.

136
- No!
- I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

137
They fire me and then out of nowhere,
they just hire me back.

138
I mean, that place must just be
falling apart without me!

139
- So you're not going to Paris?
- No, I'm still going.

140
What?

141
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people
found out...

142
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!

143
Ross, isn't that great?

144
Yay!

145
Hi. We're buying the house next door...

146
...and we were wondering
if we could take a look around?

147
I'm showing it to someone else,
but please, look around.

148
Thanks.

149
I feel like we're cheating on our house.

150
If we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be
with a hot, younger house...

151
...that does stuff
that our house won't do?

152
Ours is so much better.

153
This living room is smaller,
the dining room looks like a cave.

154
What a hole!

155
- So, what do you think?
- Loveit

156
We already have one offer. I think the lady
upstairs is gonna make another one.

157
They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?

158
The woman upstairs is nice.
She and her husband have two kids.

159
- Uh, he's on Wall Street, and she's a...
- Oh, my God!

160
Sure.

161
Hey, Joey, you wanna
come with me to...?

162
Are you okay?

163
Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

164
This has gotta be killing her.

165
No, that wouldn't kill her.

166
A coronary embolism might.

167
I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard.
I was, like, her only client.

168
Except for this guy who eats paper.

169
And I'm guessing he eats more money
than he makes.

170
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for 10 years.

171
- I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
- No, no, no! Don't call her.

172
- You wait for her to call you.
- Why?

173
Because patience is the road
to understanding.

174
Which is the key to a happy heart.

175
You blow me away.

176
All right, so promise you're gonna wait
for her to call you?

177
- I promise.
- Okay.

178
And that means never having
to give a reason.

179
What a small world!

180
And yet I never run into Beyoncé.

181
You two know each other?

182
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica
made an honest man out of him...

183
...Chandler used to be
my little love muffin.

184
So are you guys thinking
of getting this house too?

185
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

186
Don't. Don't. Don't.

187
No, actually, we are buying
the house next door.

188
Why?

189
I don't know why.

190
Oh, that decides it, then!
I was on the fence.

191
But knowing that you two
would be our neighbors?

192
Now we have to get it.

193
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

194
This cannot be happening.

195
Okay, the realtor said another couple
made an offer.

196
Maybe the Janices won't get it!
Maybe the other couple will.

197
The only way that that is going to happen
is if the other couple are the Hitlers!

198
Okay, okay! All right,
what if we get both houses?

199
- We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
- That's a great idea!

200
By the way,
I don't mean to sound distasteful...

201
...but when did you start
crapping money?

202
- You come up with an idea.
- All right.

203
We've still got three hours
till escrow closes on our house.

204
- We can still get out.
- But we love our house.

205
Will we love it so much
with her next door?

206
And she's gonna be louder
out here too!

207
Just the crickets and, "Oh, my God!"

208
Okay. But if we don't get this house,
she's still gonna show up wherever we go.

209
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.

210
Never again will you have to hear
the three words...

211
...that make your balls jump back up
inside your body!

212
Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her living next door.

213
Oh, that does it too.

214
Who is it?

215
It's me. Ron.

216
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

217
...but I think there's a way you might
be able to get her to come back.

218
This may surprise you, but rehiring
fired employees is not my main job.

219
Just hear me out.

220
How would you feel
about offering her a raise?

221
Not good, Ron.

222
Perhaps I can persuade you.

223
What if you could give your son...

224
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

225
Wow. That's pretty cool.

226
Huh? So? Do we have a deal?

227
- Qkay, you got it.
- Yes! Yes!

228
- This is gonna make me very popular.
- Oh.

229
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

230
I meant with my son.

231
Good, because the ladies, not so much.

232
Joey, this is AI Zebooker...

233
...the guy who eats paper.

234
I'm sure you've heard
that Estelle passed away.

235
I wanted to let you know
there's a memorial for her...

236
...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 10.

237
Hope you can make it.

238
Oh, my God.

239
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

240
Estelle?

241
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that
there's no hard feelings for firing me.

242
Okay. I just...
I can't believe you're calling me.

243
I didn't think I should just drop by.

244
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

245
No.No.No.

246
Anyway, you did what you had to do.
I'm okay.

247
Can I ask you something? Um...

248
What's it like there?

249
It's all right.

250
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

251
Good luck with the career.
You're gonna be huge!

252
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

253
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say.

254
Well, I just talked to Sid.

255
We are definitely putting in
an offer on the house.

256
And I'll bet we get it!

257
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

258
All right, I gotta run.
Tell Monica I say goodbye.

259
And I'll see you later, neighbor. Ha, ha.

260
Wait!

261
I just want you to know that
I'm so happy you're going to be here.

262
Oh, me too.

263
Because...

264
...that way...

265
...we can pick up where we left off.

266
- Huh?
- I never stopped loving you.

267
- Oh, my...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
I want you.

269
I need you.

270
I must have you,
Janice Litman-Goralnik neé Hosenstein.

271
Chandler, what are you talking about?

272
Now that you live next door,
we can be together every day.

273
Sid and Monica never have
to know a thing.

274
I don't know what to say.

275
I mean, you know, obviously
we have this heat between us.

276
Obviously.

277
But I love my husband.

278
And I know you love your wife.

279
I don't think we should get
this house now.

280
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream
and take it away.

281
Chandler, one of us
has got to be strong.

282
I understand.

283
Although...

284
Maybe just one last moment
of weakness.

285
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

286
They're never coming down now!

287
- Hi.
- Hi!

288
You are never going to believe
what happened to me today.

289
What?

290
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.

291
- They did?
- Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

292
Zelner called me and said, "We will
do anything we can to get you back."

293
And that I should thank some "Ron."

294
I don't even know
what department that guy's in!

295
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Well, I took it!

296
That's great!
So you're staying in New York!

297
- You're excited, right?
- Yeah.

298
Yeah, you know...
Look, the money's great.

299
- It's certainly the easier choice.
- Right.

300
But, you know, I mean, was I looking
forward to going to Paris? Sure.

301
You know, was I excited about working
in the fashion capital of the world?

302
Oh, absolutely.

303
Oh...

304
Yeah, but you know, this is...

305
It's fine. I'm fine going back
to a job where I've pretty much...

306
...gotten everything out of it
that I possibly can.

307
Um, I had really...

308
I had no idea you were
so excited about Paris.

309
Um, I mean, you said you were scared.

310
Well, yeah, I mean, it was "good" scared,
though, you know?

311
I mean, like "when I moved
to New York" scared.

312
Or, uh, "when I found out I was
gonna have Emma" scared.

313
But this is fine. This is gonna be good.

314
You should go.

315
What?

316
It's what you want. You should go.

317
You really think so?

318
I really do.

319
But I already told Zelner
that I would come back.

320
I'm sure he'll understand.

321
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go to Paris.

322
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

323
I'm going to Paris!

324
- Thank you, Ross.
- Yeah, yeah.

325
Oh.

326
Oh, I'm so happy-

327
Then I'm happy too.

328
Thank you all for coming.

329
We're here today to pay our respects
to a wonderful agent...

330
...and a beautiful woman.

331
Inside.

332
As Estelle's only two clients,
we would like to say a few words.

333
Dude, where's my speech?

334
That is entertaining.
Al Zebooker, everybody!

﻿1
All right, let's play one more time, okay?

2
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

3
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

4
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

5
Just flip.

6
- Tails!
- Damn it!

7
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

8
Oh, that sounds good.

9
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

10
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

11
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

12
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

13
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

14
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

15
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

16
- Okay, you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

17
What about your carry-ons?

18
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

19
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

20
...organized in the order
that I will be needing them.

21
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

22
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

23
- Well, it's not.
- What? Maybe I put it in here?

24
Oh! Oh, it's not in there!

25
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

26
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

27
I can't believe I did this.

28
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

29
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

30
I know.

31
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

32
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

33
- Hey!
- Hey.

34
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

35
That's because I'm pregnant.

36
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

37
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

38
No, no, I knew.

39
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

40
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

41
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

42
I wanted her to get to know the doctors
and get settled into the hotel.

43
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

44
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

45
Erica, those things aren't free.

46
In fact, they have one of the highest
markups of any consumer product...

47
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

48
I'll be right back.

49
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

50
I know. I know.

51
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

52
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

53
Plus, how much a month does it cost
to feed Joey?

54
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

55
Hey, is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

56
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

57
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

58
Hmm. Packing.
Sexy cheerleader comedy.

59
Hmm. Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.

60
(Creep)'

61
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

62
Are you kidding?

63
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

64
From?

65
Jumping on the bed.

66
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

67
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

68
- You got it.
- All right.

69
She's right. We gotta get serious.

70
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

71
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

72
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

73
You guys hear a ringing?

74
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

75
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

76
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

77
...how much this bums me out.

78
I didn't know Monica had these.

79
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

80
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

81
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

82
Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.

83
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

84
Oh, he has a gig.

85
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

86
My husband has a gig.

87
Yeah? Where is it?

88
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

89
Rock on!

90
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

91
Well, I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

92
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

93
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

94
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

95
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

97
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

98
She's kind of emotional, no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

99
Yeah.

100
Hey, Rach. Hey.

101
There she is.

102
Hi, you guys.

103
What did I just say?

104
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

105
- Come, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

106
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

107
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?

108
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

109
It feels like when Melrose Place
got canceled.

110
I mean...

111
Ah, forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

112
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

113
Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?
You know?

114
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

115
Wait a minute.

116
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

117
So you doing okay?

118
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

119
Yes. You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

120
...and I can travel internationally again.

121
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

122
You know what? Um, I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

123
...to each of you. And I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

124
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

125
If I had to guess, I'd say...

126
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

127
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

128
- Okay, well, before you do...
- Uh-huh.

129
I know we weren't supposed
to get you presents...

130
- ...but I do have something for you.
- Oh! Oh!

131
Oh.

132
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

133
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

134
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

135
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

136
I'm gonna throw this away...

137
...but thank you so much
for the gesture.

138
Chandler?

139
Um, I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

140
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

141
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

142
What are you talking about?
These aren't mine.

143
Oh, yeah, right!

144
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

145
That would be a terrible punishment.

146
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

147
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

148
Rachel used to live in that room.

149
Rachel. With handcuffs.

150
Interesting.

151
Joey's bare ass.

152
Well played.

153
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

154
Please...

155
Please don't...

156
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

157
I won't.

158
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

159
- Okay.
- Okay.

160
- Monica?
- Yeah?

161
- Will you come with me?
- Sure.

162
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

163
Oh, you're so screwed.

164
H93'-

165
What was that all about?

166
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

167
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

168
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

169
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

170
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

171
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

172
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

173
Mon. Okay.

174
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

175
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

176
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

177
No one has been
more like a sister to me.

178
I know what you mean.

179
You're like a sister to me too.

180
I don't know what
I'm going to do without you.

181
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

182
...Seeing you every day.

183
What?

184
...See you every day!

185
That is so sweet!

186
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

187
And I'm the crier in the family.

188
Oh, God, I could be next.

189
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're in conversation.

190
- Okay.
- That thing you said about the thing...

191
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

192
- Rash?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

193
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

194
Uh, Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

195
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending
to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.

196
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

197
Well, these aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

198
Don't say Richard.

199
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

200
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

201
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

202
I think these are yours.

203
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

204
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

205
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

206
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

207
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

208
Where do you think Mike really is?

209
Oh, honey...

210
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

211
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

212
I just want to say that I... I love you.

213
And I'm gonna miss you.

214
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

215
Oh, you know what?

216
Let's not say anything else.

217
I love you.

218
Not so tight.

219
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

220
Okay.

221
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.

222
I can't. I can't.

223
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

224
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

225
You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.

226
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

227
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

228
Why are they taking so long?

229
I don't know.

230
But, God, Joey seems to be handling
it surprisingly well.

231
No!

232
Okay, here we go.

233
- Well...
- Yeah.

234
I think I'm gonna take off.

235
Huh?

236
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
Thank you so much.

237
I love you.

238
Good night.

239
What?

240
I don't get a goodbye?

241
Lucky bastard.

242
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

243
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

244
- ...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

245
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

246
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

247
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

248
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

249
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

250
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

251
Not from you!

252
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

253
And say what? You owe me a goodbye?

254
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

255
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

256
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

257
Huh? Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

258
Have a baby with you?

259
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

260
- Ross...
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

261
...enough credit. Uh, I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

262
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye, g...

263
It's physically impossible!

264
You know what?
After all we've been through...

265
...I can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

266
Have a good time in Paris.

267
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

268
- ...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

269
Well, you can't say we don't know
how to throw a party.

270
I think I'm gonna head out.

271
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

272
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

273
We're moving in a couple days
and we got a lot of packing to do.

274
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

275
Yeah, good idea.

276
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

277
You couldn't be cool.

278
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

279
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

280
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

281
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

282
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

283
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

284
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

285
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

286
...and I found some pictures of them...

287
- ...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

288
Who's that dirty old lady?

289
Monica's grandmother.

290
Oh, my God. Nana liked it rough!

291
- Hi.
- Hey.

292
Here, have a seat. Yeah.

293
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

294
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

295
We went to this place that had...

296
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

297
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

298
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

299
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

300
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

301
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

302
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

303
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

304
We're gonna have a baby!

305
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!

306
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

307
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

308
Okay. Okay.

309
Okay, I feel a little better.

310
Oh! Are you sure?

311
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

312
- Come, let's go.
- Bye!

313
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

314
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

315
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

316
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

317
That's what it seemed like.

318
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

319
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

320
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

321
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

322
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

323
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

324
It's because you mean more to me.

325
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

326
- Rash!
- What?

327
- You keep... You can't...
- What?

328
- A little more.
- Okay.

329
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

330
Little more.

331
- All right. All right, let's do this.
- All right, ready?

332
Yep. Now give me your best shot.

333
All right. Here goes.

334
Doesn't work.

﻿1
Previously on Friends:

2
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

3
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go, like, every few minutes.

4
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

5
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

6
Oh, my God!

7
If you think that I didn't say goodbye...

8
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

9
It's because you mean more to me.

10
- Rash!
- What?

11
- Hey.
- Ha, ha.

12
Shh. Go back to sleep.
I have to go home.

13
Oh, God. This was amazing.

14
It really was.

15
You've learned some new moves.

16
Yeah, well, uh, this guy at work gave me
Sex for Dummies as a joke.

17
- Ah.
- Who's laughing now?

18
I am.

19
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

20
Okay. Good.

21
Next time, can I say "breathe"?

22
No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
and it scared her.

23
Can I get you anything?
Want more ice chips?

24
- No, I'm okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

25
- Where you going?
- To use the bathroom.

26
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?

27
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...

28
...that I am not comfortable with.

29
What kind of social situation
are you comfortable with?

30
It's just that we've never spent any time,
you know, alone together.

31
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.

32
Okay.

33
So, uh, any plans for the summer?

34
I don't know. Maybe church camp.

35
Ha...

36
May not want to mention this.

37
So you ever wonder which is worse?

38
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?

39
- What?
- Oh, it's just interesting.

40
You know, because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.

41
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.

42
I mean, who knows?

43
Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.

44
Like this.

45
- Come in.
- Morning.

46
- Hey.
- What's that?

47
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.

48
- That's a baby chick and duck.
- Uh-huh.

49
And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.

50
- I did not see that coming.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

51
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.

52
And when they're old,
they can go to that farm...

53
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.

54
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- That is the rule though.

56
- Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
- What?

57
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.

58
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

59
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
was gonna be a girl.

60
Have you seen him throw a ball'?

61
- Is Rachel here?
- Uh, I think she's still asleep.

62
Hey, hey, hey. How did it go
with you guys last night?

63
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

64
We, uh...
You know, we worked things out.

65
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?

66
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

67
Uh, but I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it.

68
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?

69
- I know, it's pretty great.
- So, what does that mean?

70
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.

71
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?

72
I don't know.

73
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.

74
When I was holding her,
I mean, I never wanted to let her go.

75
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.

76
Yay!
- Shh!

77
Yay!

78
So is she still going to Paris?

79
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.

80
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.

81
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...

82
...in the world again.

83
Oh. I feel like I'm in a musical.

84
When the sun comes up
Bright and beamin'

85
And the moon comes

86
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.

87
- Hey.
- Hi.

88
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

89
- Good.
- I'll bet you did.

90
Uh, would you guys mind
giving us a minute?

91
Sure. Yeah. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.

92
Chick and the duck'? Didn't they die...?

93
Dive. Yeah, they dove.
Headfirst into fun on the farm.

94
O

95
- Morning.
- You too.

96
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.

97
I woke up today
with the biggest smile on my face.

98
I know, me too. It was...

99
You know, it was like one of those things
you think is never gonna happen.

100
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.

101
I know. It was just...

102
It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.

103
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!

104
- Is it really that bad?
- Uh-huh.

105
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
and see which is worse.

106
The baby's head is crowning.

107
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful
top of a head I have ever seen.

108
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.

109
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.

110
- It's the miracle of life.
- All right.

111
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

112
Start pushing. Here we go.

113
Here come the shoulders.

114
It's a boy.

115
- Is he okay?
- He's just fine.

116
You did it.

117
It's a baby.

118
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

119
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.

120
Well, that's spongy.

121
Oh...

122
Hey, handsome.

123
I'll love you so much that no woman
is ever gonna be good enough for you.

124
- We are so lucky.
- I know.

125
He has your eyes.

126
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.

127
- We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
- Okay.

128
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

129
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

130
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

131
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.

132
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?

133
The next baby should be
along in a minute.

134
We only ordered one.

135
- You know it's twins, right?
- Oh, yeah.

136
These are the faces
of two people in the know.

137
I can't believe you didn't know its twins.
This has never happened before.

138
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.

139
Did you know it was twins?

140
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork
we got from the clinic.

141
- Did anybody tell you?
- I don't think so.

142
Although, they did mention something
about two heartbeats...

143
...but I thought that was just mine
and the baby's.

144
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."

145
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
because I'm having a baby."

146
- This is unbelievable.
- Twins actually run in my family.

147
Interesting.

148
Can I see you for a second?

149
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"

150
Twins!

151
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?

152
What do you say we keep one and then
just have an option on the other one?

153
- We can't split them up.
- Why not?

154
We could give each of them
half a medallion.

155
And then years later,
they'll find each other...

156
...and be reunited. I mean,
that's a great day for everybody.

157
Okay. What if the person who adopts
the other one is horrible?

158
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?

159
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.

160
Monica, we are not ready
to have two babies.

161
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.

162
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.

163
I don't care if the entire cast
of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.

164
We are taking them home
because they are our children.

165
Okay. Shh.

166
- Okay!
- Okay!

167
Okay.

168
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.

169
Start pushing again now.

170
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?

171
Yeah.

172
Well, now we have one of each.

173
And that's enough.

174
And then she said it was the perfect way
to say goodbye.

175
Oh, my God.

176
What did you say?

177
- Nothing. What do you say to that?
- Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel.

178
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.

179
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

180
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.

181
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
even wanna get back together.

182
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.

183
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!

184
Oh, okay, this is the part of the musical
where there'd be a good, convincing song.

185
Don't take no for an answer

186
Don't let love fly away

187
- Hi.
- Can't a girl finish a song around here?

188
- Hey.
- Hi. So I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

189
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?

190
No, we decided that
I'd go ahead and set up first...

191
...then my mom would bring Emma
to Paris on Sunday.

192
Wow. Eight-hour flight with a baby.
Good luck, Mom.

193
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mom
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.

194
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.

195
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?

196
Could you get me a muffin?

197
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

198
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.

199
I love you.

200
Now, I don't know if that changes
your plans at all.

201
But I thought you should know.

202
Gunther.

203
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.

204
But I do. And when I'm
in a café having coffee...

205
...or I see a man with hair
brighter than the sun...

206
...I'll think of you.

207
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

208
Oh, my God!

209
Unbelievable.

210
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!

211
Do you think they recognize
each other from in there?

212
Maybe. Unless they're like people
who've lived in apartments...

213
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...

214
...and they meet.

215
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.

216
There's something
that we wanted to tell you.

217
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.

218
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!

219
Son of a gun, it is.

220
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

221
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.

222
Even Chandler.

223
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.

224
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

225
Have fun at church camp.

226
- Look at these little bunnies.
- I know.

227
You ready to trade?

228
_Qkay-
_Qkay-

229
Okay. Let's see.

230
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.

231
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.

232
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?

233
No, I sat in the paint.

234
- Hey.
- So did you talk to Rachel?

235
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

236
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.

237
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.

238
How can you compare
yourself to Gunther?

239
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.

240
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.

241
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.

242
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I mean, sometimes...

243
- Uh, Joe.
- Damn it!

244
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.

245
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.

246
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.

247
Do you know how many hot guys there
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.

248
- Hey.
- Hey.

249
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.

250
If I had more time to work on it,
it'd be better, but...

251
- Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
- Honey, that's gorgeous.

252
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.

253
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!

254
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.

255
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.

256
- Apparently, there's some big surprise.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?

257
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.

258
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.

259
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

260
Hey.

261
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?

262
- Oh, my God!
- How did this...?

263
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?

264
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my... They are so cute.

265
- Now, what kinds are they?
- This is a boy. And that's a girl.

266
Her name is Erica.

267
Hey, that pregnant girl's name
was Erica.

268
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.

269
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.

270
- He's gonna be so happy.
- Jack Bing. I love that.

271
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.

272
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."

273
Oh, my gosh.

274
- So beautiful.
- I want one.

275
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

276
Seriously. I mean,
you want to make one of those?

277
- One? How about a whole bunch?
- Really?

278
Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
and we could be like the von Trapp family.

279
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.

280
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.

281
- I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
- Me too.

282
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
to watch you two attempt to handle this.

283
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.

284
- I love you all so much.
- Love you.

285
- We love you.
- Call us when you get there.

286
I will. Ross, come here.

287
I just want you to know...

288
...last night...

289
...I'll never forget it.

290
Neither will I.

291
All right. Now I really have to go.

292
Okay, au revoir.

293
Ugh.

294
They're gonna really hate me over there.

295
So you just let her go?

296
Yeah.

297
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?

298
Yeah. You know, you just...
Look, you gotta...

299
You gotta think about last night
the way she does.

300
Okay? You know, maybe...

301
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

302
- But now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?

303
Maybe it is better this way.

304
I mean, now... Now you can move on.

305
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.

306
Maybe now that you're
on different continents...

307
- Right?
- Yeah.

308
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.

309
You can finally get over her.

310
Yeah, that's true.

311
Except.

312
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?

313
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Really?

314
- Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
- Yeah, you are!

315
Wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!

316
- My coat.
- This is so cool!

317
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!

318
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- I don't know.

319
But even if she shoots me down,
at least I won't spend my life wondering...

320
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?

321
You didn't bring one! My cab's
downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.

322
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

323
Good luck!

324
- There's no seat belts!
- That's okay. If we hit anything...

325
...the engine will explode,
so it's better if you're thrown from the car.

326
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!

327
- Hey!
- 80th and East End.

328
- No. I don't take passengers.
- The law makes you accept any fare.

329
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.

330
What's your medallion number?

331
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!

332
- What?
- Get out of the cab!

333
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
your housewarming gift now?

334
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.

335
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

336
Don't hide from Mama!

337
You can open your eyes now.

338
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!

339
- Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.

340
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
- Do you want to get to Rachel in time?

341
Yes, but I don't want
to die in your cab.

342
You should have thought of that
before you got in!

343
- Tollbooth.
- What?

344
Toll booth!

345
Four bucks. There are quarters
in the glove compartment.

346
Hurry!

347
Okay. Aah!

348
Damn, that window's clean.

349
Quack, quack. Tweet, tweet.
Quack, quack.

350
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.

351
Tweet, tweet. Quack, quack.
Tweet, tweet. Quack, tweet, quack.

352
We were wondering
what was taking so long...

353
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.

354
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...

355
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

356
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?

357
Oh, great. Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!

358
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!

359
Don't worry, we'll find them.

360
- I'm gonna go check on the twins.
- All right.

361
Oh, God! What did I just step on?

362
- It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
- Oh.

363
You stepped on my egg roll?

364
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.

365
Just put it on a plate and leave.

366
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- All right.

367
Wait, wait. You hear that?

368
- They're in the table!
- Well, that can't be good.

369
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?

370
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?

371
Oh, tons. I'm quite the Woodsman.

372
Well, maybe we can just
tip the table a little.

373
Joey, wait! The ball!

374
So, what do we do?

375
Maybe we can open this up somehow.

376
Okay.

377
No. It's all glued together.

378
Does that mean
we have to bust it open?

379
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

380
I know. it's... It's the foosball table.

381
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.

382
It's like I would have said in that
sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.

383
Those are our men in there,
and we have to get them out...

384
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...

385
...my time machine.

386
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.

387
Jack Weinberg,
white courtesy phone. Jack Weinberg.

388
- Ross, where are you going?
- Uh, to talk to Rachel.

389
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?

390
You're walking up to her at the gate?

391
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?

392
Not since my cop show got canceled.

393
You have to get a ticket
to get past security.

394
- What? We're never gonna make it.
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!

395
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.

396
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.

397
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
any of my high school French.

398
But I understood every word
you just said.

399
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.

400
Oh...

401
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

402
- Madame, if you don't have your...
- I have it, I have it!

403
Oh...

404
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
that I was in seat 32C...

405
...because that's my bra size.

406
You must have your boarding pass...

407
You know what? If I was in 36D,
we would not be having this problem.

408
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?

409
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?

410
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- We're on our honeymoon.

411
- And the destination?
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.

412
I'm so lucky I married you.

413
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?

414
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.

415
In your face. You're a different person.

416
Sorry.

417
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.

418
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?

419
No, no, it's impossible.
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.

420
Maybe we have the flight number wrong.

421
God.

422
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.

423
What?

424
Hey. Hey, listen...

425
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.

426
But Monica...

427
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

428
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.

429
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.

430
Monica. Monica. Monica. Monica.

431
- Monica?
- Isn't that cute?

432
That is precious! Listen...

433
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- Oh, okay.

434
- All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
- I have that. It's not on the board.

435
That's what it says here. Flight 421.
Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.

436
- What?
- Newark Airport.

437
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.

438
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!

439
And we're also gonna buy you
tiny bird hearing aids.

440
Okay. Here goes.

441
What's the matter?

442
I need to say goodbye to the table first.

443
I understand.

444
Okay.

445
Table...

446
...you have given us
so many great times.

447
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...

448
All of you guys. What can I say?

449
You guys make us look good.

450
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.

451
Except that, for one last time...

452
Good game. Good game. Good game.

453
- Good game.
- Yeah.

454
Okay. Here we go.

455
I can't do it.

456
Well, I can't do it either.

457
- Hey. Did you find them?
- Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.

458
And we have to bust it open,
but neither of us can do it.

459
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.

460
I'll do it. Give me.

461
Phoebe! No, no, no!

462
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.

463
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.

464
There's no way we'll make it in time.

465
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.

466
You don't have any other choice.

467
- Hello?
- Rachel. Oh, good.

468
By the way,
did you just get on the plane?

469
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...

470
- ...if we were at the right airport.
- Yay.

471
Um, Rachel, hang on.

472
No. No. No.

473
Phoebe, is everything okay?

474
Um...

475
Actually, no. No.
You have to get off the plane.

476
- What? Why?
- I have this feeling that...

477
...something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with the left phalange.

478
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.

479
Look, I have to go. I love you, and I
will call you the minute I get to Paris.

480
Um, ahem...

481
- What was that?
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.

482
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...

483
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.

484
- Okay. Uh, that doesn't sound good.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

485
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.

486
- But she is sometimes.
- Well...

487
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.

488
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
- I have to get off this plane.

489
Her friend has a feeling something's wrong
with the left phalange.

490
Could I get some peanuts?

491
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.

492
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."

493
Oh, my God. This plane
doesn't even have a phalange.

494
- I'm not flying on it.
- Please sit down.

495
- What's going on'?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!

496
This is ridiculous. I...

497
Yeah, okay.

498
All right. My job here is done.

499
That was impressive.

500
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.

501
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

502
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.

503
- Sorry about the table, man.
- Yeah.

504
You gonna buy a new one?

505
Probably not. No.

506
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.

507
- Well, at least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.

508
Aw, we were worried about you.

509
Hm.

510
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?

511
I'm gonna miss these little guys.

512
It was nice having birds around again.

513
Hey, you know what? Maybe we
should keep them here with you.

514
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

515
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.

516
I could get a goose!

517
You know, I think you're set
with the poultry.

518
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

519
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...

520
...you know, because, uh...

521
Because now you have a reason
to come visit.

522
I think there may be another reason.

523
So, uh...

524
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?

525
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.

526
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
- And you fixed the phalange?

527
Yes. The phalange's fixed.

528
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges on board, just in case.

529
Paging Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Josh Anderson.

530
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

531
- Rachel! Rachel Green!
- There she is!

532
Rachel! Rachel!

533
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.

534
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.

535
- No, no. But you don't...
- Rachel!

536
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

537
Okay. You're on.

538
What? What, Ross? Okay, you're
scaring me. What's going on?

539
- Okay. Thing is...
- Yeah.

540
- Don't go.
- What?

541
Please, please stay with me. I am
so in love with you. Please don't go.

542
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I know.

543
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but, um... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.

544
But I'm telling you now. I love you.

545
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?

546
(Hey, he)'-

547
I know you love me. I know you do.

548
- Miss
- l...

549
I... I have to get on the plane.

550
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

551
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.

552
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

553
Rachel.

554
I'm so sorry.

555
I really thought she'd stay.

556
I know.

557
I'm sorry.

558
Well, that's it.

559
Everything's packed.

560
Wow.

561
- This is weird.
- I know.

562
Yeah.

563
Uh, does this mean
there's nothing to eat?

564
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.

565
I love you.

566
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?

567
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but, um, she got on the plane anyway.

568
Where's Ross?

569
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.

570
Ross. Hi, it's me.

571
I just got back on the plane,
and I just feel awful.

572
That is so not how I wanted things
to end with us.

573
It's just that I wasn't expecting
to see you.

574
And all of a sudden you're there
and saying these things.

575
Now I'm just sitting here and thinking...

576
...of all the stuff I should have said
and I didn't.

577
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you
that I love you too.

578
Because of course I do. I love you.

579
I love you.

580
I love you.

581
What am I doing? I love you.

582
I've got to see you.
I've got to get off this plane.

583
Oh, my God.

584
- Okay, excuse me.
- Miss, please sit down.

585
No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
but I need to get off the plane.

586
- I need to tell someone that I love them.
- I can't let you off.

587
Let her off the plane!

588
You have to take your seat.

589
Oh, please, miss.
You don't understand.

590
Try to understand!

591
Come on, miss, isn't there any way
that you can just let me off the...?

592
No! No!

593
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?

594
I got off the plane.

595
You got off the plane.

596
I do love you.

597
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.

598
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. Okay? No more messing around.

599
- I don't want to mess this up again.
- Me neither. We're done being stupid.

600
Okay. It's you and me, all right?
This is it.

601
This is it. Unless we're on a break.

602
Don't make jokes now.

603
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.

604
Thank you.

605
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

606
Wow.

607
I know.

608
Seems smaller somehow.

609
Has it always been purple?

610
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.

611
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.

612
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.

613
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?

614
Oh, yeah. That's true.

615
Uh, I haven't.

616
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...

617
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?

618
Do you realize we almost made it
10 years without that coming up?

619
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger
that we'd leave our keys.

620
Oh, okay.

621
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

622
I guess so.

623
This is harder than I thought
it would be.

624
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

625
Come on.

626
Do you guys have to go to the new
house now, or do you have some time?

627
We got some time.

628
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.

629
Where?

﻿1
Uh, okay, Ross.

2
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but, uh...

3
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

4
Rach, he just saw us.

5
Shh.

6
Uh, but what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

7
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

8
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

9
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that happened...

10
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

11
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

12
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

13
- But...
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

14
Yeah. But it did happen.

15
So...

16
Ross?

17
Can we just close the door?

18
Ross, say something.

19
Anything.

20
So you two are?

21
Yeah.

22
And have you had?

23
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

24
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you?

25
Probably...
No. No.

26
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

27
You have every right
to go nuts.

28
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

29
No, but you know what I mean.

30
Hey, hey, hey.

31
If you two are happy...

32
...then I'm happy for you.

33
I'm fine.

34
- Really?
- Absolutely.

35
I'm fine.

36
Totally fine.

37
Heh. I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

38
...because, really...

39
...I'm fine.

40
I'm not saying
I wasn't a little surprised...

41
...heh, to see you guys kissing.

42
I mean, at first I was like:

43
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

44
Loving this.

45
- Ross...
- It's all working out.

46
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

47
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

48
No.

49
We should all have dinner.

50
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

51
Wow. Uh, look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

52
Weird? What? What's weird? Huh?

53
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

54
...because I'm making fajitas!

55
I do like fajitas.

56
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

57
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

58
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

59
There's a hair in my coffee.

60
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

61
Have you seen Frank Jr?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

62
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

63
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

64
Oh, that's sweet.

65
Drink your hair.

66
Hey, what's all this stuff?

67
Oh, they're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

68
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

69
Get this one.

70
That's not really how it works.

71
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

72
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

73
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

74
- Thanks, that would be great.
- Sure.

75
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

76
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

77
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

78
That's not what we talked about!

79
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

80
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

81
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

82
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

83
Oh, well, uh, uh,
that's, uh, Frank Jr. Jr...

84
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

85
And, uh, that's, uh, Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

86
And, uh, that's Leslie
throwing bagels at him.

87
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

88
Oh, can I just say, I know we're doing
this for Ross and that's cool.

89
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

90
Well, what would we be doing?

91
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

92
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

93
Feel me up?

94
In a carriage.

95
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

96
- Hi.
- Hey. Hmm.

97
So...

98
...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

99
- Mm.
Mm-hm.

100
So did you, uh,
bring a little something for Ross?

101
Actually, uh, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

102
Oh, well, thanks.

103
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

104
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
Heh, heh.

105
Ah, I thought I heard voices.
What? Ha, ha.

106
Hi, Charlie. Mwah.

107
- Hey, Joey. Ha.
- Hey.

108
And, uh, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

109
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know... Uh...

110
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

111
Okay.
Uh, well, we brought you some wine.

112
Oh. Ah. That is so thoughtful.

113
She's a keeper. Ha.

114
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Uh, actually, that's, uh...

115
Underwear, a toothbrush...

116
...and a Van Halen CD.

117
I can use all these things!

118
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little, um...

119
What? Fine? Because I am, huh?

120
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
You see?

121
Who else is fine?

122
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

123
Listen. Why don't you, uh, try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

124
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

125
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

126
Oh, God.

127
So adorable.

128
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

129
- Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
- Mm.

130
...because, uh, before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

131
Well, they may be a handful...

132
...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

133
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing. Ha, ha.

134
I haven't slept in four years.

135
That's a long time.

136
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

137
There's just so many of them.

138
You know, two I could handle.

139
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

140
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

141
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

142
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

143
Yeah, I know, Frank.

144
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

145
Sometimes, I think that, uh...

146
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

147
What?

148
No, no, I can't.

149
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

150
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

151
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

152
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

153
What?

154
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

155
Thank you so much for seeing us.

156
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

157
Oh, please, we're happy to help.

158
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

159
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

160
I mean, you have a lovely home.

161
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

162
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

163
It's pretty much...

164
...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

165
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

166
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

167
Thank you.

168
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

169
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

170
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

171
That's great. Can I see the book?

172
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

173
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

174
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

175
I would have told him to do it too.

176
Can I adopt you?

177
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

178
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

179
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

180
- Huh?
- You know how to use a compass?

181
I have a badge in it.

182
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

183
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

184
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

185
What?

186
What?!

187
I'm adopted?

188
I got nothing.

189
Well, that first batch of
margaritas was not so great...

190
...but this second batch is good.

191
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

192
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

193
You know, just the four of us.

194
Just hanging. Ha.

195
Dude, are you okay?

196
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

197
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

198
I'm just...
I'm just proud of us.

199
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

200
No awareness.

201
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

202
You know, oh, let's take a trip!

203
Okay, where do you think we can go?

204
My fajitas!

205
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

206
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

207
He normally doesn't drink like this.

208
Oh, you know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

209
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

210
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

211
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

212
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

213
Okay, well, this is crazy.

214
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

215
Oh, no, of course we're not.

216
- That's insane.
- I know.

217
Alice would never go for it.

218
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

219
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

220
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

221
Huh.

222
Frank Jr. Jr?

223
You'd be getting a really good one.

224
I mean, you know,
he's really funny.

225
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

226
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

227
A talking frog.

228
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny. Ha, ha.

229
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about, um, Leslie?

230
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

231
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

232
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

233
Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

234
I got big hopes for her.

235
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

236
Wow, Frank. Ha.
I think we just ran out of kids.

237
Oh, I think you're right.

238
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

239
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

240
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

241
You know, I'll help out more.
I can babysit anytime you want.

242
You name the day and I'll be there.

243
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

244
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

245
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

246
Tsk. You'd do that for us?

247
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

248
Tsk. Oh.

249
Oh, look at them.

250
Oh. I love you so much.

251
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

252
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

253
- Can you believe how nice they are?
- We have to leave.

254
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

255
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

256
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

257
...I may have told him.

258
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

259
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi. Ha.

260
Some little snacks for everybody.

261
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

262
I'll get him in a second.

263
Uh, by the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

264
But kids are so intuitive.

265
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

266
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

267
What? Where did you hear that?

268
He told me.

269
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

270
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

271
You told him he's adopted?

272
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

273
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

274
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted...

275
...and he also thinks Santa is real."

276
He isn't?

277
We have to get out of here, baby.

278
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

279
...to Rachel and Joey.

280
And to love.

281
Ah, love!

282
Mm.

283
L-O-V-E. Love.

284
I is for "life."

285
And what is life without love?

286
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

287
O is for:

288
"Oh, wow!"

289
The V is for this...

290
...very surprising turn of events...

291
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

292
E...

293
...is for how...

294
...extremely normal I find it...

295
...that you two...

296
...are together.

297
And that one day
you might get married...

298
...and have children of your own.

299
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

300
Ross, you don't seem okay.

301
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

302
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

303
Wait, Ross. Ross, I, um...
I have to take off.

304
- No!
- I'm sorry.

305
I have an early class in the morning.

306
But this has been lovely.

307
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

308
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

309
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

310
- Okay.
- All right.

311
Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just...

312
Oh, that's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

313
Fine.

314
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

315
Hey.

316
Hey, that rhymes.

317
You know what, Ross,
I think, uh, we're gonna take off too.

318
Oh, oh. Heh.
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

319
You guys are a couple now.

320
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

321
- No, it's just getting late...
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

322
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

323
I don't even know what that's for.

324
You know what?

325
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

326
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

327
Uh-huh. Okay.
- All right.

328
Yeah, you know, Joey, I...

329
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

330
- It doesn't look good, does it?
- Mm-mm.

331
Morning.

332
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

333
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

334
So you took off my pants and shoes?

335
No. No, no.

336
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.

337
Ahem. Look, uh, Ross...

338
...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

339
...because nothing's gonna happen.

340
What do you mean?

341
She and I said from the beginning...

342
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

343
And clearly...

344
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

345
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

346
Of course you're not fine. You're...

347
You're Ross and Rachel.

348
Yeah, except we're not.

349
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

350
...six years.

351
My God, is that right?

352
Has it been that long?

353
That's what I hear, yeah.

354
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

355
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

356
Can I ask you something?

357
Really...

358
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

359
Come on, you know me. Ha, ha.
You know...

360
Joey.

361
I'm crazy about her.

362
And she feels the same way?

363
I think so.

364
Well, then...

365
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

366
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so...

367
No, but I want to be.

368
And hey:

369
I will be.

370
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

371
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

372
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

373
No, that was, uh...
That was just for me.

374
Hey, you, uh?

375
You sure about this?

376
Yeah, I'm sure.

377
And...

378
...we're okay?

379
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

380
Um, we just want to give
you a heads up.

381
Bill and Colleen hate us.

382
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

383
What?

384
Still, he had to find out sometime.

385
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

386
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.

﻿1
- So you and Rach tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

2
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

3
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

4
Nah. No. This is the part
I'm actually good at, ha, ha.

5
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?

6
It's okay.

7
How can you be so confident?

8
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

9
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

10
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

11
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

12
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

13
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

14
You mean like this?

15
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

16
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

17
Ahem. More foosball?

18
- And beer.
- Yeah.

19
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
Hey, sweetie.

21
Wow.

22
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

23
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

24
I'm sorry, it's just...
How'd you get so tan?

25
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

26
You got a spray-on tan?

27
Chandler gets pedicures.

28
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

29
Why? Why?

30
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

31
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

32
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

33
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

34
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

35
Hey, I know where this place is.

36
It used to be an X-rated video...

37
Florist.

38
Hey.

39
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey, Phoebe.

40
Ugh, you won't believe
who moved back to town.

41
- I know. Amanda.
- Ugh.

42
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

43
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.

44
Then she moved to England
and picked up this fake British accent.

45
On the machine, this is her message:

46
"Um, Monica,
darling, it's Amanda calling."

47
Are you trying to do a British accent?

48
Chandler gets pedicures.

49
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

50
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?

51
"Oh, so sorry
to catch you on your mobile."

52
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

53
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

54
Oh, I know.

55
"Uh, I slept with Billy Joel."

56
All right, who hasn't?

57
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

58
Oh, let's just cut her out.

59
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

60
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

61
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

62
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

63
Feels good.

64
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

65
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

66
Well, uh, I like how you look.
What are you?

67
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

68
You'll face the red light.

69
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

70
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

71
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

72
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

73
- Wow, you catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...

74
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three...

75
Wait, wait!
I'm not... I'm not finished counting.

76
You sprayed my front twice.

77
- You never turned?
- No. I barely got to "three Mississippi."

78
Mississippi? I said count to five.

79
Mississippi-lessly?

80
Well, how bad is it?

81
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

82
So how dark will it get?

83
Oh, you got sprayed
with two twos and...

84
I'm a four?

85
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

86
Really?

87
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay.

88
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

89
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

90
My eyes!

91
The same thing happened again!

92
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight.

93
Thanks for dinner.

94
I thought you paid.

95
Heh. Guess we won't be going
back there, ha, ha.

96
- So...
- Yeah.

97
Hey, what do you say we, uh, move this
onto the likes of the couch?

98
I say cheesy line, but okay.

99
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

100
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

101
Okay. Sorry.

102
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

103
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

104
Okay.

105
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

106
- Okay.
- Okay.

107
Uh, was that good for you?

108
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

109
Oh, yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

110
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right. Oh.

111
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

112
Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.

113
I'm in the neighborhood,
hoping I could pop by your flat.

114
You're from Yonkers.
Your last name is Buffamonteezi.

115
Let's see.
So should you get this directly...

116
...ring me back on my mobile.

117
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

118
Hello? Is someone on the line?

119
Yes. I was looking for Monica.

120
Hang on, she's right here.

121
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

122
I get pedicures.

123
Hi, Amanda.

124
Uh, actually, now is not a good time.

125
- Dinner tomorrow night?
- No.

126
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

127
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

128
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

129
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

130
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

131
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

132
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

133
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

134
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

135
Okay, well, uh,
how can we make it easier?

136
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

137
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

138
- Okay, ha, ha.
- Okay.

139
- Is this thing welded shut? Ha, ha.
- Okay.

140
All right, turn around.

141
- I gotta get a look at this thing.
- Oh.

142
- Ow!
- Sorry.

143
Well, this is romantic.

144
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

145
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

146
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

147
...and it popped open.

148
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

149
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

150
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

151
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

152
No, I don't have another level.

153
Hold on. There's something different.

154
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

155
Was that place the sun?

156
Oh, and it gets worse.

157
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.

158
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

159
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

160
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three...

161
Damn it!

162
- I know!
- Ha-ha-ha.

163
Oh, what is up
with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

164
How was your date with Joey?

165
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

166
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

167
...and I kept slapping it away.

168
You didn't like that?

169
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

170
He couldn't even undo my bra.

171
Wow, really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

172
I do not know what's wrong with us.

173
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

174
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

175
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

176
You guys have been friends forever.

177
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

178
- Mm-hm.
- You couldn't stop laughing.

179
- You got through that.
- Mm-hm.

180
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

181
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

182
Hey, uh, Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

183
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

184
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

185
You don't know.

186
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

187
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

188
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

189
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

190
Oh, okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

191
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

192
- Are you kidding? I love it.
- Okay.

193
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

194
Hello.

195
- It's so nice to see you.
- Ha, ha.

196
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look.

197
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

198
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

199
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

200
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
- Oh, smell my neck.

201
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

202
- Musty.
- Oh.

203
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

204
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

205
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

206
And I remember, because that was the
year I had sex with Evel Knievel. Ha, ha.

207
Uh, we were friends in 1992.

208
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

209
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

210
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

211
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, bugger.

212
Should I not have said that? Unh!
I feel like a perfect arse.

213
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

214
Hello?

215
Chandler, what's wrong?

216
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

217
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

218
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

219
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

220
- Hey.
- Hi.

221
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

222
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

223
...and, in the interest
of powering through...

224
Okay, sexy, sexy.

225
Very sexy, sexy.

226
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

227
- Oh, get over it, soldier, we gotta do this.
- Okay.

228
- Okay. Ha, ha, you like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

229
You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?

230
Oh. Oh.

231
Yeah, baby.
I'll show you how we do it.

232
No, no, no.

233
You kneed me in my misters.

234
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

235
Joey? Are you okay?

236
Soldier down.

237
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

238
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

239
Oh, Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

240
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Wow. My flat is twice this size.

241
Please, Monica, in the hall?

242
Ooh, that accident
must have been terrible.

243
You look positively ghastly.

244
Well, aren't you a treat.

245
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

246
It was right after
we were living together...

247
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

248
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

249
Well, I'm still all those things.

250
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

251
I am scrappy.

252
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

253
Of all the people I've cut out...

254
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

255
That's because I'm scrappy.

256
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

257
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

258
I don't know what
I would do without you.

259
Oh.

260
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

261
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

262
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

263
Let me explain how this works.
Go in the booth and...

264
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay? Ha, ha.

265
Does it look like this is
my first time, huh?

266
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

267
Okay.

268
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles.
Which one is it? Which one is it?

269
Oh, son of a bitch!

270
What is the matter with us?

271
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

272
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

273
...difficult?

274
I don't know.

275
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

276
- Hey.
- Hi.

277
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

278
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

279
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys...

280
No, no, no. No, I mean...

281
...sexually.

282
Yeah, uh, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

283
...really wrong?

284
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

285
If felt like, uh:

286
"I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

287
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

288
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

289
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

290
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

291
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

292
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

293
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

294
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

295
That's a plan.

296
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

297
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

298
Mm-hm.

299
Me too.

300
Well, how come Monica and Chandler
could do it?

301
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

302
Aw.

303
- I bet you're right.
- Hmm.

304
So...

305
Yeah.

306
I love you.

307
Love you too.

308
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

309
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

310
- It's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away.

311
I don't wanna see anybody.

312
I went to the tanning place
and the same thing happened to me.

313
Let me in.

314
Really?

315
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

316
You're not tan.

317
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.

﻿1
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
Honey, I got us that room
at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

3
That place in Vermont?
You can take a hint.

4
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.

5
- Yeah.
- We're having a party.

6
Can't you have the party
when we get back?

7
- No.
- No. It won't be her real birthday.

8
Gee, if only she were 1 and had
no idea what the hell a birthday was.

9
Come on, you guys,
this is really important to us.

10
Sorry, but Chandler and I
could really use a weekend away...

11
...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.

12
I read about it in Maxim.

13
Well, can't you just go
to Vermont the next day?

14
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

15
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.

16
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.

17
I mean, how can we have
her first birthday party...

18
...without her aunt and her uncle?

19
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.

20
Fine. But if we end up not doing
this Maxim thing because of this party...

21
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.

22
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...

23
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.

24
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.

25
Aw, I love family traditions like that.

26
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...

27
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.

28
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

29
- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
- Oh, good!

30
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...

31
...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
- Oh, cool.

32
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

33
Oh, just think, she's gonna be
watching that video on a TV...

34
...that hasn't even been invented yet...

35
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.

36
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...

37
...to escape the ant people.

38
That's the hope.

39
- So is Emma awake yet?
- No, it's still naptime.

40
- But she'll be up soon.
- Where's Joey?

41
I said, it's still naptime.

42
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.

43
Hey, say something to Emma
on her 18th birthday.

44
- Eighteen, huh?
- Joey, no!

45
What? What? It's for her hot friends.

46
When they see this, you'll be 52.

47
And starting to think about
settling down.

48
Hey, Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?

49
Love to. Yeah.

50
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

51
Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?

52
- Joey, it's a birthday party.
- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.

53
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for, like, an hour at a cup.

54
Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,
dressed as a farmer.

55
And he's standing next to this cow,
and the cow says, "El-moo."

56
Man, that's a funny cup.

57
Hey.

58
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.

59
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.

60
I know you guys really want to get to
Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.

61
But it really is to us, okay?
Emma will never have a first birthday again.

62
You're right. We're sorry.

63
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!

64
No, she didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.

65
Are you frigging kidding me, Green?

66
- Hi!
- Hey!

67
- I'm so glad you came.
- I can't believe Emma's already 1.

68
I remember your first birthday.

69
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.

70
He pulled on his testicles so hard...

71
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.

72
There's something you didn't know
about your dad.

73
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.

74
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?

75
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?

76
If we gave this present to Emma
from all of us.

77
Which one are you?

78
- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
- I know. What are we gonna do?

79
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

80
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.

81
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.

82
I'm not going to Vermont
with this Monica.

83
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

84
I was thinking since you wrote a song...

85
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.

86
So you're gonna hit on her?

87
- No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
- Oh.

88
You know, I could, like, maybe...

89
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.

90
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

91
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- Oh, Emma might like what?

92
- Uh, my present.
- What did you get her?

93
- Actually, we prepared performances.
- Separate performances.

94
But equally real.

95
That sounds like fun.

96
You know what, actually?

97
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.

98
So would you mind
performing them once now?

99
- Sure, yeah!
- Okay.

100
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started, huh?

101
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.

102
Oh, great.

103
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?

104
I do it every week with three cameras
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.

105
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

106
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.

107
Oh, okay. Which one?

108
Uh, well, it's one of her favorites.

109
"Riding the Storm Out:
Coping With Postpartum Depression."

110
Love You Forever.

111
"Love You Forever, by Robert Munsch.
Published by Firefly Books. Printed...

112
...in Mexico.

113
Ahem. A mother held her new baby
and very slowly rocked him...

114
...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.

115
And while she held him, she sang,
'I'll love you forever.

116
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...

117
...my baby you'll be."'

118
"And while he rocked her, he sang:

119
'I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.

120
As long as I'm living...

121
...my baby you'll be."'

122
Oh, wow!

123
That was amazing.

124
Thank you so much for that gift.

125
I was not ready for this today.

126
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

127
- Phoebe has prepared something.
- That's right.

128
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.

129
For there's no greater gift
than the gift of music.

130
Emma

131
Your name poses a dilemma

132
'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma

133
Maybe the actor, Richard Crenna

134
He played the commanding officer
in Rambo.

135
Happy birthday, Emma

136
Is that it?

137
No, of course not.

138
No, I've also, you know,
prepared a reading.

139
Um, "Sex and the Single Mother."

140
- "Finding your G-spot."
- Oh, no, no, no!

141
Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.

142
Right now, that seems so far away,
17 years.

143
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be...

144
Well, your grandfather and I
might not be here.

145
That's true. This message
could be coming to you...

146
...from beyond the grave, Emma.

147
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.

148
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.

149
Okay, cut! Great. Great. That was just...

150
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

151
Ross, uh, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.

152
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.

153
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.

154
Oh, my God, that place has
the creamiest frosting.

155
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.

156
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...

157
...in all different shapes. And if you give
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.

158
- Did you do a picture of Emma?
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

159
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...

160
...erotic cakes?

161
Say, for bachelorette parties?

162
Ross, what are you talking...?
Oh, my God!

163
They put my baby's face on a penis!

164
Now it's a party!

165
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny,
all right?

166
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!

167
Uh... Is it okay that I still think
it looks delicious?

168
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.

169
The resemblance is uncanny.

170
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.

171
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
okay?

172
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...

173
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!

174
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

175
...so we could put it on the bunny.

176
That is a weird sentence.

177
Oh, believe you me,
I am going to bring this cake back.

178
I don't even want it in my home.
Don't touch it!

179
I'm so confused!

180
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!

181
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!

182
To be fair, this one does have nuts.

183
Hey, Mon, it was nice of you
to loan Rachel your car...

184
...so she could get the cake.
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...

185
...till I dropped the key.

186
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...

187
...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?

188
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.

189
Are you still enjoying your nap?

190
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.

191
You may not recognize us...

192
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.

193
We used to be married.

194
But then we missed a weekend away
together, and things kind of unraveled...

195
...because of you.

196
Happy birthday.

197
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.

198
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.

199
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.

200
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.

201
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.

202
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?

203
All right, five more minutes.

204
Hello?

205
Oh, no, what happened?

206
Okay, okay, where are you?

207
Okay, I'll be right there.

208
Was that Emma? Is she up?

209
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.

210
She forgot her license.
So I have to bring it to her.

211
- If you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!

212
We've been complaining the longest!

213
No, wait, you guys. No, you can't leave.

214
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.

215
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?

216
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.

217
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.

218
Got it!

219
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

220
To the bathroom.

221
Well, the rest of you
get comfortable, okay...

222
...because we are gonna be here for a...

223
- Wait, there's a window in there.
- Oh, no! He's not getting away that easy!

224
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

225
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.

226
- No, it did not.
- No.

227
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.

228
Jack's not allowed
to drive at night anymore.

229
He has trouble staying in his lane.

230
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.

231
The papers thought it was a hate crime.

232
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.

233
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Nighty-night.

234
- Nighty-night.
- Bye.

235
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey.

236
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.

237
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
a Quaker to get out of Korea.

238
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in. Ha.

239
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?

240
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.

241
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

242
- Hey.
- So how'd your audition go today?

243
- What audition?
- The one I told you about last week.

244
What? You never said anything
about an audition.

245
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.

246
I think you can still make it.

247
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
need to have a monologue prepared.

248
A monologue? I don't have a...

249
I got it. Uh...

250
So I'm gonna take off.

251
- What?
- What? Wait! You don't get to leave.

252
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.

253
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!

254
Well, okay, now...

255
...only one of us has to stay with Emma.

256
Okay, and as the person
who realized that, I get to go.

257
No, no, no. No. No.

258
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.

259
Oh, I got it.

260
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to 10, all right?

261
Whoever gets the highest number
gets to go first.

262
- Okay, 10.
- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.

263
Anyone else?

264
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.

265
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer...

266
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Right.

267
Okay, how about this? We got
wind-up toys for Emma for her birthday.

268
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.

269
Yeah, let's do that!

270
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!

271
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- Okay. I want the dolphin!

272
- That's a bear.
- I'm too excited!

273
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.

274
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.

275
And the race is going to go
from here to here.

276
Now, the one who comes in last stays!

277
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.

278
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!

279
Come on, robot!

280
What are you barking at?

281
Well, how is that gonna help?

282
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?

283
Way to go, robot!

284
Good job, Alan.

285
- Hey, good race, you guys.
- Yeah, see you later.

286
No. No, no. Wait.

287
We didn't lose.

288
The rules clearly stated that the last one
to cross the finish line was the loser.

289
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically...

290
They left.

291
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're just gonna come home.

292
Everybody left?

293
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.

294
- Rachel!
- Oh, God, sorry!

295
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.

296
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?

297
I can't believe this.

298
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
we're not even there.

299
Everybody left. We still have
this stupid obscene cake.

300
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.

301
Oh, don't even bother.

302
We've already ruined
her first birthday.

303
And do you know how important these
early experiences are, Ross? Very!

304
According to the back cover
of that book that you gave me.

305
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

306
I guess.

307
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?

308
Emma laughing...

309
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."

310
And then we would all... Hey, get out
of the road, you stupid student driver!

311
They have to learn.

312
- Hey.
- What?

313
This is not bad.

314
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?

315
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.

316
And then I split this to make ears.

317
Well, I am very impressed.

318
Some can sing, some can dance.

319
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.

320
Now, another way to organize
your stuffed animals is by size.

321
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma
or for Monica?

322
Game?

323
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're 1.

324
One year old. That's little.

325
That's my girl.

326
That's how old you are.

327
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?

328
Aw, I want one.

329
Me too.

330
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?

331
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.

332
I wasn't. Let's get going.

333
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.

334
- Good, I didn't miss the party.
- What about your massage client?

335
I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
slipped him a little something, you know.

336
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.

337
Okay.

338
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.

339
I've been here the whole time.

340
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.

341
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.

342
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.

343
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?

344
How old are you today?

345
Oh, Emma, that's right. You're that many.

346
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.

347
- This means...
- No! No science camp!

348
- Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
- Oh...

349
Oh, and, Emma, look at your
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.

350
Thanks.

351
Okay, here we go.

352
Emma's first birthday cake.

353
Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle.

354
Come on, Emma. You can do it.

355
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.

356
These are happy tears. Ha, ha.

357
This is just what I wanted.

358
Hey, you made it into a bunny.

359
What is wrong with me? It looked
more delicious when it was a penis.

360
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay, you ready?

361
- And record.
- Okay.

362
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and...

363
Go! Go! Come on!

364
Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard!

﻿1
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma
have her first cookie.

2
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

3
I've never given her a cookie.

4
- Have you?
- No.

5
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

6
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

7
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

8
Of course. I would be honored.

9
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

10
I think there's been an oversight.

11
Joe, we would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

12
Yeah, it's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

13
Clearly, we were wrong.

14
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

15
And I know how much you want
to have a baby...

16
...and I would love to help you get one.

17
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

18
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

19
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."

20
So excited about your letter.

21
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

22
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

23
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

24
What's it the anniversary of?

25
Your first, uh, date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

26
Yeah.

27
So you must be going somewhere
fancy to celebrate.

28
Uh-huh. Um, a Knicks game.

29
Uh, ha, ha...
Aren't you a little overdressed?

30
Hey, I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

31
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

32
...and I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

33
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

34
You guys do that?

35
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

36
That's where people make number two.

37
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

38
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to...

39
Oh. Oh...

40
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

41
Oh... Fine. It's fine.

42
I'll just shower by myself.

43
B. B. B. B. B.

44
Ross, you gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

45
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

46
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open! It's your sister!

47
I have to talk to you.

48
Hi, Amy.

49
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

50
Um, Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

51
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

52
And you are?

53
Ross? I grew up on your block?

54
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

55
I had a baby with your sister?

56
No. I...

57
Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

58
Yes. Yes, you did.

59
Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister Amy.

60
She thinks I need pec implants.

61
Amy? Hi.

62
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

63
- The Days of our Lives guy.
- That's right, yeah.

64
You are not good.

65
Always nice to meet a fan.

66
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- I have huge news.

67
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

68
Uh, her name is Emma.

69
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

70
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

71
Hey, your English is getting better.

72
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

73
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

74
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

75
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

76
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

77
Watch.

78
Here, you highlight the word
you want to change, uh, go under "tools"...

79
...and the thesaurus generates... Gives.

80
Gives a whole list of choices.

81
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

82
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

83
No, no, I'm:

84
"Brainy, bright, clever." I love this thing!

85
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

86
God...

87
...so beautiful.

88
I know, isn't she?

89
No, I was talking about your bedding.

90
- All right, what's your news, Amy?
- Oh. Ahem.

91
Well...

92
...I'm getting married.

93
Wow! Oh, my God!

94
- To who?
- This guy.

95
He has a killer apartment.

96
- And?
- And it's on 5th.

97
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

98
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

99
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

100
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

101
- Huh. Wow, so he's gotta be...
- Old? Yeah.

102
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

103
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

104
...you like the apartment
more than you like...

105
Myron.

106
Yeah, I told you he was old.

107
Sit down. Sit down.

108
Oh, honey, you know...

109
...I once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

110
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

111
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

112
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

113
Um... But anyway, listen.

114
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

115
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

116
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

117
...and that you care about.

118
You're right.

119
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

120
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

121
Okay.

122
Okay, let's keep talking.

123
Excuse me. Anniversary.

124
Excuse me. Anniversary.

125
Um, yeah.

126
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

127
It's my anniversary.

128
Here we are.

129
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

130
This has been the best year...

131
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

132
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

133
I feel the same way!

134
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

135
It's our anniversary.

136
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

137
Someone has a special question to ask.

138
Aw...

139
Oh, how lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

140
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

141
Excuse me.

142
Hey. I finished my recommendation.
Here.

143
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

144
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

145
I don't understand.

146
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

147
It doesn't make any sense.

148
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

149
On every word?

150
Yep.

151
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

152
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

153
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing Homo sapiens...

154
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

155
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

156
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

157
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

158
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

159
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself?

160
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

161
Your full-sized aortic pump.

162
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

163
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

164
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

165
Yes, you are.

166
- Aw, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

167
- Oh.
- So can I stay with you?

168
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

169
Ah, look who's back.

170
Why do you have bags?
Rach, why does she have bags?

171
I'm staying with you guys.

172
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

173
Come on.

174
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

175
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

176
But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

177
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

178
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

179
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

180
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

181
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

182
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

183
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

184
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

185
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

186
Yeah. Monica made us.

187
Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...

188
...because I don't think I would be
the person that I am today...

189
...if it wasn't for you guys.

190
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

191
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

192
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

193
Amy, that's what I
was supposed to wear today.

194
That's why I hung it on the door.

195
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

196
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

197
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

198
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

199
I am not happy.

200
Uh... Sure you want to eat that?

201
I'm curvy and I like it!

202
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

204
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

205
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

206
- Seriously?
- Word.

207
Well, mine was worse than that.

208
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game...

209
...and this guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

210
- Oh, that is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

211
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

212
Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?

213
- Phoebe, that's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

214
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

215
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna propose...

216
...I don't think he's ever gonna ask again.

217
I mean, I said no in Barbados,
and now this?

218
She's right. If I were a guy and...

219
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

220
Maybe you don't need him
to propose to you.

221
Maybe you could propose to him.

222
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

223
I proposed to Chandler.

224
All right, moving on.

225
I don't think it was desperate.
I think it was amazing.

226
Thank you.

227
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

228
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

229
Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?

230
How about at a game on the big screen?

231
Huh! How about at a Foot Locker?

232
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

233
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

234
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

235
But what would a guy think?

236
- Uh, Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

237
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

238
She did?

239
Who got her condo in Boca?

240
Hello?

241
It's our nanny.

242
Hi.

243
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

244
That's Molly. She's sick.

245
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

246
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

247
Menstrual cramps.

248
I don't think that's what this is.

249
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

250
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

251
Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?

252
Well, I could do it.

253
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

254
Yeah.

255
Um, I do not want her
babysitting our child.

256
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

257
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

258
- What, the next one?
- Okay.

259
I don't want her watching our baby.

260
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

261
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

262
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

263
- You know, I don't know.
- Ross, I'm telling you...

264
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

265
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

266
Uh, listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

267
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

268
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

269
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

270
So how much does it pay?

271
Hey, Joe. How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

272
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

273
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

274
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

275
No can do, amigo.

276
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

277
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

278
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

279
See you later.

280
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

281
We're never gonna get a kid.

282
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

283
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

284
It's okay. It's okay. You know what?

285
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

286
Okay, good.

287
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

288
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

289
Uh-huh.

290
Okay.

291
Thank you. Goodbye.

292
We're screwed, aren't we?

293
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

294
- They loved it.
- What?

295
They thought it was very smart of us to have
a child write the recommendation letter.

296
They thought Joey was a child?

297
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

298
- Hi.
- What'd you guys do today?

299
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

300
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

301
Babies are dull.

302
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

303
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

304
- Ready?
- Yeah.

305
Ta-da!

306
You pierced her ears?

307
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

308
You pierced her ears?

309
How could you do this
without telling me?

310
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

311
I think she looks cute.

312
But I am wrong.

313
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

314
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

315
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

316
Hi, Emma.
Oh. Why is she wearing her hat so low?

317
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

318
Why not?

319
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

320
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

321
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

322
Come here. Come here.

323
There she is. Hi.

324
- What?
- Nothing.

325
Hi.

326
What...?

327
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

328
Did she do this to her?

329
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

330
I know. And you were right, Ross.

331
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

332
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

333
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

334
Okay.

335
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

336
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

337
This is how you repay me?

338
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

339
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

340
I am going to be a baby stylist.

341
- What?
- That's not a thing!

342
Well, it should be.

343
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

344
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

345
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

346
- Amy, I... I just... I just wanna...
- What? What are you gonna do?

347
No more falafel for you!

348
- Great game, huh?
- Uh-huh.

349
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

350
Please let the Knicks win.

351
Thank you, Thor.

352
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

353
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

354
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

355
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

356
Someone has a special question to ask.

357
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

358
Get a load of this.
She's proposing to him!

359
Guess we know who wears the pants
in that family.

360
Well, that's not very enlightened.

361
Hey! Hey!

362
Boo us? Boo you!

363
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

364
Oh, hi.

365
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

366
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

367
Okay, bye-bye.

368
She was nice.

369
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

370
Woo-hoo!

371
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

372
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

373
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

374
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

375
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

376
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

377
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

378
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

379
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

380
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

381
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

382
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

383
Except without that stupid Jill. Oh.

384
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

385
Seriously?

386
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

387
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

388
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

389
She was. Carbs found her.

390
See? This is what I wanted.

391
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

392
Oh, I can give you that.

393
- You can?
- Yeah.

394
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're...

395
You're already a pretty perfect version
of what you are.

396
Thank you.

397
You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.

398
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

399
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

400
Obviously, you have balls.

401
- Please, let's just forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

402
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

403
But just so you know...

404
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

405
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

406
...or in skywriting...

407
...or, you know, like some lame
guy in a cheesy movie...

408
...who hides it in the cake.

409
It's in the cake, isn't it?

410
Where else would lame
Mr. No-Balls hide it?

411
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

412
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

413
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

414
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you...

415
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

416
- Phoebe, I...
- Wait. Oh, wait.

417
Oh, no.

418
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

419
Okay.

420
Phoebe, I love you.

421
There's no one else in the world I would
ask to marry me three times.

422
But I want to take care of you...

423
...have babies with you...

424
...and grow old with you.

425
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

426
Yes.

427
- I love you.
- I love you more.

428
Not possible.

429
She's gonna be Mrs. No-Balls!

430
So how's the, uh, baby-styling
business going?

431
Not that great.

432
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

433
That's shocking.

434
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

435
Hello, Ross?

436
He's rude.

﻿1
- Mm, hey.
- Hi.

2
Pheebs, what's wrong?

3
Ah, I'm just so exhausted from dragging
around this huge engagement ring.

4
Oh, my God.

5
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

6
So did he get on one knee?
Did he have a speech prepared?

7
Oh, did he cry?

8
Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals.

9
Well, it was really sweet,
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.

10
Here's to Phoebe, who's found
the greatest guy in the world.

11
To Phoebe and...

12
I want to say "Mike"?

13
- To Phoebe and Mike.
- Hey.

14
- Thank you.
- Oh.

15
- Oh, and I have something for you.
- Hmm.

16
It's my little black book. It's got
the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

17
Oh, ha, ha. Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.

18
Give it to one
of your other single girlfriends.

19
I would, but you're the last one.

20
Give me the book!

21
"Pablo Diaz.

22
Brady Smith." Ha.

23
"Guy in Van"?

24
Oh, my first love.

25
Ah.

26
What does the red X next
to Bob Gremore's name mean?

27
Dead.

28
Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah.

29
And he lived a full life. He was
in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

30
I should've given you guys
my black book when I got married.

31
Although, it wasn't so much
a book as a napkin.

32
With Janice's phone number on it.

33
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

34
Oh, yes, they are.

35
Hey, honey.

36
Hey, sweetie.

37
- Is Monica not here?
- No.

38
Oh, then I'll tell you.

39
My agency was bidding
for a big account, and they got it.

40
- It's my first national commercial.
- Cool.

41
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.

42
Hell, you weren't there.
All the ideas were mine.

43
That's great.
Hey, can you cast me in it?

44
Oh, I really don't think
you're right for the part.

45
What do you mean?
I can do anything. I'm a chameleon, huh?

46
I'm old.

47
Huh, I'm tired, huh?

48
Oh, I am hot. I'm
cold, huh? Come on, what can't I do?

49
First of all, bravo.

50
Uh, but I don't think
you're right for this.

51
The part's a stuffy college professor.

52
I can do that.

53
Hello, I'm your professor.

54
When I'm not busy thinking
of important things, or professing...

55
...I like to use...
Oh, what's the product?

56
Software that facilitates
inter-business networking e-solutions.

57
I'm cold.

58
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
Guess who's a finalist
for a huge research grant?

60
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.

61
Huh, well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...

62
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."

63
Ha, ha. Uh, I'm so excited.

64
Apparently, I beat out
hundreds of other applicants...

65
...including five guys
I went to graduate school with.

66
Not that I'm keeping score,
or anything. Five.

67
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

68
- So tell me about the grant.
- Well, okay, it's for $25,000.

69
And if I get it, I'll finally be able
to complete my field research.

70
And there will be an article about me
in the Paleontology Review.

71
It'll be the first time
my name is in there...

72
...without people raising
serious questions about my work.

73
- Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
- Yeah. Why?

74
Benjamin Hobart
is administering that grant.

75
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

76
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
if your new boyfriend gets this grant?

77
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.

78
No. No, we ended on great terms.

79
If anything, I think this could
help you. You know what?

80
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.

81
- If you think it'd help.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.

82
Now, is there anything I could
do to butter him up?

83
- Anything he really likes?
- Hmm.

84
He does have
a pretty serious latex fetish.

85
We'll see how dinner goes.

86
- Hey.
- Hey, you want to go see a movie?

87
I told you I had to spend all day
clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.

88
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

89
Now that I'm here, I might as well help
with the cleaning and organizing.

90
I just happen to have my label maker.

91
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.

92
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?

93
Huh, Chandler did.

94
- What does he want you to give up?
- A bunch of stuff.

95
And the worst one...

96
He wants me to get rid of Gladys.

97
Who's Gladys?

98
- Oh, what a tragic loss.
- Mm-hm.

99
Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.

100
Oh, I... I don't know.

101
- Oh, what, you don't like her?
- Heh, of course I do. What's not to like?

102
I'd take her in a minute.

103
But I think that you're
giving up too easy.

104
I think that you need
to fight for her.

105
- Really, you think?
- Absolutely.

106
You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike,
I can't live without her.

107
She means too much to me."

108
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.

109
Oh, wait. Oh, I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.

110
Damn it, I did not think this through.

111
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

112
Oh, any word on casting yet?

113
- I told you, you're not right for the part.
- What do you mean?

114
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

115
I'm sorry, this sounds like something
I'm never gonna be interested in.

116
Look, come on, please? It's not like
I'm asking you for some crazy favor.

117
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.

118
Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work.

119
Here's my reel. It's got all
the commercials that I've been in.

120
- Joe...
- Uh, just watch it.

121
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.

122
- Fine.
- Thank you.

123
- Work, Joe.
- Damn it.

124
- What am I gonna do now?
- Just pass the tape along.

125
He's not right for the part.

126
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.

127
And that's something
they should learn on their own.

128
Oh, just tell Joey
that you watched the tape...

129
...and you liked it,
but your bosses didn't.

130
Then you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.

131
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.

132
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.

133
I can't believe I'm about
to meet Benjamin Hobart.

134
Um, I've always thought of him
as someone I'd invite...

135
...to my fantasy dinner party, ha, ha.

136
Do you think there's any chance
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?

137
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.

138
Charlie.

139
- My God, you look absolutely stunning.
- Oh.

140
Well, I am having a good hair day.

141
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, you too.

142
BENJl:
Mm.

143
Ahem, I'm okay.

144
Um, I'm sorry. Um, Ross Geller,
Benjamin Hobart.

145
Oh, it's an honor to meet you.
I can't tell you how long...

146
...I've been an admirer of your work.
I mean, that Nobel Prize, uh, whoo!

147
- Ha, ha.
- Oh.

148
I mean, I have to tell you that you're
one of the reasons I got into the field.

149
Oh, well, uh, likewise.

150
Uh, not likewise. I'd never heard of you
until this morning.

151
But it's nice to be nice.

152
- Uh, shall we?
- Yeah, ahem. Thank you. Ahem.

153
I can't believe that you chose
this restaurant.

154
- Do you remember the night?
- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.

155
BENJl: Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh, my God.

156
I can't believe
they let us back in this place.

157
- You weren't there.
- Ha, ha.

158
No, but, you know,
it's just a funny image.

159
You know, the two of you
in this restaurant with the hmm...

160
Why don't you tell Benji about your
proposal while I go to the ladies' room.

161
So tell me about it.

162
Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig
in the Painted Desert.

163
Mm-hm.

164
There are still several areas
that haven't been fully excavated.

165
- Break up with Charlie.
- What?

166
What?

167
Did you just say,
"Break up with Charlie"?

168
Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
And no, I didn't not say it.

169
Um, kind of inappropriate,
don't you think?

170
Listen, I'm sorry.

171
I just haven't seen her for so long,
all these feelings are rushing back.

172
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.

173
And I'm gonna need you
to break up with her.

174
- Are you serious?
- If you say, yes, then I'm serious.

175
If you say, no, then I'm joking.

176
- No.
- Joking it is.

177
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?

178
- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
- Huh, no, he really hates it, ugh.

179
But he's gonna let me keep
my box of human hair.

180
So you gotta pick your battles.
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.

181
Wow, what's the bad news?

182
- Who's Gladys?
- Oh, she's that work of art I made.

183
You know, with the woman
coming out of the frame.

184
Ah, and Monica gets to keep her?

185
In her house? I am so jealous.

186
- Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too.
- Oh.

187
Well, I mean, sure, of course.

188
But you already gave that
to Monica, so...

189
- You know, I would give her up for you.
- No, I couldn't let you do that.

190
- No, but I want to.
- But I don't want you to.

191
- But I insist.
- But I insist harder.

192
Girls. Girls. Stop.
Okay, we'll flip a coin.

193
Heads, she's Rachel's.
Tails, she's Monica's.

194
- Tails.
- Oh.

195
- Monica, she's yours.
- No, that landed in your food.

196
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.

197
- Hey, Joe?
- What's up?

198
Bad news. I watched the tape
and passed it along to my bosses...

199
...and they weren't interested.
- Oh.

200
I'm sorry, man.

201
- But, uh, you watched the tape?
- Yeah, I... I liked it.

202
But, uh, my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.

203
- You didn't watch the tape.
- What? Of course I did.

204
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
but to lie to me?

205
- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
- Ah, you lied again.

206
- I watched it.
- Keep going, Pinocchio.

207
- I did.
- No, you didn't!

208
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.

209
- Did you watch the tape?
- No.

210
The selection committee has chosen
the three of you as our finalists.

211
The decision will be based on the
answers you give to the questions I ask.

212
We'll start with Dr. Li.
You claim the field is too reliant...

213
...on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose to correct this?

214
I believe that the answers lie
in the osteological evidence.

215
- I plan to begin there.
- Interesting.

216
I guess.

217
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some
fieldwork. Where might that take place?

218
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
of South Dakota.

219
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

220
What? I... Uh.

221
Care to venture a guess?

222
- May 12?
- That's not even kind of close.

223
Dr. Li, how many graduate students
will you need?

224
- Half a dozen.
- I see. And Dr. Biely?

225
Three for excavation,
and two for analysis.

226
Certainly. Dr. Geller,
which 1965 Shirelles hit...

227
...was later covered by
a popular British Invasion band?

228
What?

229
What? I need six graduate students.

230
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."

231
"Baby It's You."

232
What? Wait just a minute.

233
None of my questions have anything
to do with paleontology.

234
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.

235
Spell "Boscodictiasaur."

236
Um, I've never heard
of a "Boscodictiasaur."

237
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

238
- Okay. B-O...
- No, it starts with a silent M.

239
Oh, come on!

240
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.

241
But you are a liar.

242
What did I just say?

243
- Are you still here?
- Yes.

244
And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
When I tell somebody I did something...

245
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?

246
Then you lied about lying, okay?

247
Then you lied about lying
about lying, okay?

248
So before you lie about lying
about lying about lying about lying...

249
Stop lying.

250
Why are you so sure
I didn't watch this tape?

251
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?

252
Well, this is going well.

253
Here's how I know.

254
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.

255
All right, remember,
I got paid a lot of money for this...

256
...and it only aired in Japan.

257
Ichiban.

258
Ichiban, lipstick for men.

259
And that's how I know
you didn't watch the tape.

260
He really is a chameleon.

261
Well, Gladys, say hello
to your new home.

262
- Oh, my.
- Wow.

263
Oh, she is so nice and big.

264
Oh, Monica, where are you going
to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?

265
I haven't really settled
on a spot yet.

266
How about right above the TV?

267
That way, it will be the first thing
that you see when you walk in the door.

268
Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
of that French poster.

269
- I like that poster.
- Really?

270
It doesn't have anything
coming out of it.

271
Or maybe there's someplace
for her in your bedroom?

272
- Oh, there's nothing above your bed.
- Are you still here?

273
Oh, hi. Hello.

274
Uh, have you come to ask me some
more paleontology-related questions?

275
Um, your grandmother's nickname,
perhaps?

276
Ann-Margret's pant size?

277
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...

278
...for Charlie interfere
with the interview process.

279
No. Stop!

280
Anyway, I decided
to offer you the grant.

281
- Really?
- There is just, uh, one small stipulation.

282
- I have to break up with Charlie?
- Hey, you got one right.

283
- You're crazy.
- Crazy or romantic?

284
Crazy.

285
- Or?
- Get out!

286
Oh, my God!

287
- What?
- Joey, what is this thing doing here?

288
I got her from Monica. She sold it
to me for a very reasonable price.

289
- Joey, we're not keeping this.
- But it's an original Buffay.

290
All right, fine. You can keep it.

291
As long as you don't mind
that she's haunted.

292
Hey, what? Whoa. What?

293
Well, legend has it, Joey, that she
comes alive when you're asleep.

294
She climbs out of the frame...

295
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...

296
...just looking for legs to steal.

297
And then with her one good hand...

298
...she slowly reaches up...

299
...and turns your doorknob.

300
Get that legless witch out of here!

301
- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.

302
- Two can play at this game.
- Too late. You can't give it back.

303
- Oh, yes, I can.
- No, you can't, she's yours.

304
- She's yours.
- She's yours.

305
- She's yours.
- Hey.

306
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

307
You guys, you don't have
to fight over her anymore.

308
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.

309
- I want Gladys.
- She's mine.

310
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

311
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't give them your tape.

312
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.

313
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.

314
I know. You're right.

315
Oh, what's it
gonna take for you to forgive me?

316
Oh, my God.

317
Oh, excellent.

318
Now what do you say?

319
Lying is wrong.

320
And? And?

321
I'm a pretty little girl.

322
I knew it. Ha, ha.

323
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

324
- Did you get the grant?
- No. And you wanna know why?

325
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.

326
What?

327
He refused me
because I wouldn't give you up.

328
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.

329
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?

330
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:

331
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"

332
I'm sure he was just joking.

333
If you don't believe me,
let's go talk to him.

334
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
one paleontological question.

335
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:

336
Uh,
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"

337
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O...

338
Damn it.

339
Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are
you doing here?

340
I want you to tell her everything.

341
About the deal you tried to make
with me, about the crazy questions you...

342
Wally Cox.
That's the voice of Underdog.

343
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...

344
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

345
No, don't do that. I want you to look
her in the eyes and tell her the truth.

346
Benji?

347
It's true. I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.

348
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.

349
Too little, too late, Benji.

350
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.

351
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?

352
No.

353
- Yes.
- What?

354
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...

355
...romantic.

356
Or?

357
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...

358
...but is there any chance
you would take me back?

359
Maybe.

360
Sweetie, this conversation is starting
to make me a little uncomfortable.

361
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but...

362
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?

363
I'm sorry too.

364
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.

365
Okay, that's it,
we are seeing other people.

366
Gladys?

367
For the third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.

368
- You're mean!
- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.

﻿1
Hey, you guys.

2
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

3
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
- We were doing the same thing.

4
Yeah.

5
It's really crazy.
The hall, the dress, the food.

6
- I had no idea how expensive this stuff was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.

7
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?

8
It was simple. I came up with
some cost-cutting solutions...

9
...wrote out a list
and Monica told me to go to hell.

10
There's no way around it.

11
Just accept that this is
gonna cost a lot of money.

12
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $40 billion-a-year industry.

13
Yeah. And I'm responsible
for just, like, half of that.

14
But really, it does seem like this money
could be put to better use.

15
Are you serious?

16
Yeah. Now, how would you feel if we gave
all the wedding money to charity...

17
...and we just got married at City Hall?

18
I think it would make me
wanna marry you even more.

19
Well, I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.

20
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.

21
No, no, no. The next time's
gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

22
But maybe the time after that.

23
- Hey.
- Hey.

24
What's going on?

25
Our adoption social worker is coming by,
so we're cleaning the apartment.

26
"We"?

27
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.

28
Hey, is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?

29
- Kind of. She's coming to see where we live.
- And it has to go perfectly.

30
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.

31
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap-opera fan.

32
It's very impressive when
the little people know a celebrity.

33
"Little people"?

34
"Celebrity."

35
So I think I'm just about done here.

36
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?

37
What?

38
- No.
- Chandler.

39
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.

40
So there's not a magazine
under the couch...

41
...or a pack of cigarettes
taped to the back of the toilet tank...

42
...or a filthy video in the VCR?

43
I'll admit to the cigarettes
and the magazine.

44
But that tape is not mine.

45
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.

46
- May I help you?
- Yes.

47
We're here to make a rather
sizable donation to the children.

48
Well, any contribution,
large or small, is appreciated.

49
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.

50
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.

51
This is completely anonymous.

52
Completely anonymous.
From two kind strangers.

53
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.

54
We can put your names
in our newsletter.

55
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.

56
And X is spelled, uh, "Mike Hannigan."

57
All right, well, on behalf of the children,
thank you both very much.

58
- Sure. I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
- It does. It feels really good.

59
Oh, look.
And we get these free T-shirts.

60
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.

61
It's moist.

62
- Emma will be up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

63
Oh, hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.

64
Aw, that's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
other beautiful paleontologists out there.

65
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.

66
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.

67
So, uh, what are you gonna do today?

68
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma
to the playground.

69
Oh, my God. What?

70
Like I said, I was thinking of taking
Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.

71
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.

72
Because?

73
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...

74
...swing incident when I was little.

75
- Seriously?
- Yes. I was 4 years old.

76
And I was on the swing...

77
...and then all of a sudden my hair
got tangled in the chain.

78
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.

79
And it was uneven for weeks.

80
And you made it through that?

81
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.

82
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.

83
And I was thinking Claire Danes.

84
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your tragedy.

85
Okay? But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.

86
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

87
And there's that moment
when you're at the top...

88
...when you just don't know
if you're gonna return back to Earth.

89
Space is filled with orbiting children.

90
Look, please, just come on.

91
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.

92
- All right.
- Good.

93
You don't wanna be a mothers...

94
...who pass on their irrational fears
to their children, do you?

95
"Irrational," huh?

96
I'll remember that next time you freak
out about a spider in your apartment.

97
Oh, yeah, that's the same.

98
I'm sure there are 30 different species
of poisonous swings.

99
Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early.

100
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

101
- Okay.
- Here we go.

102
Stand up straight.

103
Big smile.

104
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?

105
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But, hey, I'm glad you're here.

106
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.

107
I don't know if you wanna use it, but...

108
Oh, this is so sweet of you.

109
Oh, but I won't be needing a veil.
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.

110
I told you, I am not coming
to a naked wedding.

111
No, no, no.
We're not having a big reception.

112
We took the wedding money
we were gonna spend...

113
...and donated it to a children's charity.

114
That's crazy!

115
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.

116
Yeah, well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.

117
This is really nice for you, but...

118
Oh, please. I put this on
and, ugh, I just look like...

119
Well, radiant.

120
All right, but who cares? You know,
I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.

121
That's right.
You're making a commitment.

122
And, you know, that's the same
whether you do it at the Plaza or...

123
- Where you gonna do it?
- City Hall.

124
Oh!

125
Oh, that sounds nice.

126
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.

127
Okay. No, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I've made my decision.

128
What I really want
is a great big wedding.

129
Yay!

130
- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.

131
- I don't think you can do that.
- Why not?

132
This is her wedding day. That's way
more important than some stupid kids.

133
That's sweet, honey,
but save something for the adoption lady.

134
- All right, okay. Be careful.
- Okay.

135
Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair!

136
- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
- I know. I know.

137
But they're just so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.

138
I promise you she's safe, okay?
Watch how much she loves this.

139
- Okay. Okay.
- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.

140
Okay, careful. Okay. Oh.

141
She's smiling.

142
Look at that, she does like it.

143
- See, I told you.
- Oh. Ah!

144
Oh, my God. Look at her,
she's a little daredevil.

145
- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
- Oh, absolutely.

146
Okay. Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.

147
Okay.

148
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly. Aah!

149
We're seriously asking
for the money back?

150
It's for our wedding day.

151
All right, now, is this guy gay or straight?
Because one of us has to start flirting.

152
Wow. You here to make another
donation the same day?

153
I don't think that's ever happened before.

154
Gay. Go.

155
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

156
The donation we made earlier?
Um, well, we want it back.

157
Excuse me?

158
See, okay, that money was for
a big wedding we thought we didn't want.

159
But it turns out we do.

160
So you're asking us to refund
your donation to the children?

161
Yeah.

162
This feels really good.

163
Yeah, I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
just really important to me.

164
Hey, it's none of my business.
Besides, this is probably a good thing.

165
We've really been spoiling the children,
what with all the food and warm clothing.

166
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.

167
And especially to me.

168
Okay, I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.

169
And I spent my sweet 16
being chased around a tire yard...

170
...by an escaped mental patient who,
in his own words, wanted to:

171
"Kill me, or whatever."

172
So I deserve a real celebration.

173
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
little man make me feel badly about it.

174
She could've been talking about
either one of us.

175
Hi, I'm Laura.
I'm here for your adoption interview.

176
Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler.

177
- Hi. Thank you.
- Please come in.

178
- Would you like something to drink?
- Water would be fine.

179
We're so glad that you're here.

180
We're really excited about
getting this process started.

181
Because we love kids.
Love them to death.

182
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.

183
We love kids the appropriate amount...

184
...as allowed by law.

185
- Your place is just lovely.
- Thank you.

186
Yes, this building does have
a wholesome, family feel to it.

187
I feel like I've been here before.

188
Are any other couples
in the building adopting?

189
Is that that couple on the first floor?

190
Because we should get a baby
before them.

191
That guy tried to sell me drugs.

192
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.

193
Oh.

194
- What?
- I just realized why I remember this place.

195
- Really? What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing.

196
I went on a date with a guy who lived
in this building. It didn't end very well.

197
That wouldn't, by any chance,
be Joey Tribbiani?

198
- Yes!
- Of course it was.

199
We had a great night. In the morning,
he promised he'd call and he didn't.

200
Rat bastard!

201
- So you're not friends with him?
- Oh, God, no.

202
- No, no, no.
- No. Nope.

203
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. No.

204
No.

205
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.

206
So are either one of you planning
on staying at home?

207
Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?

208
Ow!

209
What was that?

210
That's just some crazy guy
who roams the halls here.

211
He's great with kids, though.

212
- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Son of a bitch!

213
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.

214
Ross, see, I told you!
Those swings are evil!

215
All right. That is it.

216
That's the last time Emma is getting on
one of those things for her entire life.

217
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
the swing's fault. It was my fault.

218
And kind of that kid's fault.

219
Who is still laughing. Nice.

220
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?

221
No. Okay, okay. Wait. I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing...

222
...and you'll see that there's
nothing to be afraid of.

223
I know what this is all about.

224
You've always been jealous of my hair.

225
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.

226
- All right, fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

227
- If you hold a spider.
- Where? Where?

228
If you hold a spider.

229
I know.

230
Guys, is everything okay?
It's me, Joey.

231
Adoption!

232
What's going on?

233
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...

234
...Bert, roaming the halls.

235
- Guys?
- Keep on roaming, Bert!

236
We don't want any crazy today!

237
- What's going on?
- We'll talk later, Bert. Everything's fine!

238
Everything doesn't sound fine.

239
Is he all right out there by himself?

240
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...

241
...Ernie.

242
- Bert and Ernie?
- You can't make this stuff up.

243
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet 16.

244
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it ended okay.

245
One of my friends shot him.

246
Well, at least you'll get a proper wedding.
You really deserve that.

247
Yeah, I really do.
You know, I had nothing growing up.

248
Just like the kids I took the money from.

249
No. No, no. I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.

250
Look, I can't have a wedding
with this money now. It's tainted.

251
Fine, we'll give the money back.

252
If that guy at the charity
gives us a hard time...

253
...my friend hasn't shot anyone
in a really long time.

254
I must say this seems like a lovely
environment to raise a child in.

255
You are welcome to look
under any of the furniture...

256
...because, believe me, you won't find
any porn or cigarettes under there.

257
Before we look around, let me make sure
I have everything I need up to here.

258
Why don't I show you the baby's room.

259
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me in.

260
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Well, we're not.

261
But you called me "Bert."

262
That's our code word for danger.

263
- We don't have a code word.
- We don't?

264
We really should.

265
From now on, "Bert"
will be our code word for danger.

266
So that was the baby's room.

267
- Uh, what room should we see next?
- Any room that isn't behind this couch.

268
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.

269
I did not care for that.

270
You have to get out of here.

271
You slept with our social worker
and never called her back.

272
She is still pissed, so she can't see you.

273
Okay, okay.

274
- What?
- I forgot my bat.

275
Oh, my God.

276
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!

277
And we don't wanna buy your bat!

278
What are you doing here?

279
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.

280
- Are you friends with him?
- I can explain.

281
Joey?

282
All right. Okay. Uh...

283
Wow. Yeah...

284
You have got some nerve
coming back here.

285
- I can't believe you never called me.
- Excuse me?

286
You probably don't even remember
my name. It's Joey, by the way.

287
And don't bother telling me yours,
because I totally remember it, lady.

288
I waited weeks for you to call me.

289
I gave you my number.
You never called me.

290
Don't try to turn this around on me.

291
I am not some kind of social work...

292
...that you can just...

293
...do.

294
- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
- Really? Think about it. Come on.

295
You're a beautiful woman. Smart, funny.

296
We had a really good time. Huh?

297
If I had your number,
why wouldn't I call you?

298
I don't know.

299
Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

300
Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
You broke my heart.

301
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?

302
- Joey, wait...
- No!

303
I waited a long time!
I can't wait anymore.

304
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
I'm so embarrassed.

305
- Oh, that's really okay.
- Yeah. We totally understand.

306
- Dating is hard.
- Boy, you people are nice.

307
And I've got to say...

308
...I think you're going to make
excellent parents.

309
Laura!

310
We're back.

311
Are you here to take more money?

312
Because I think what you're
looking for is an ATM.

313
No, no, we're here
to give the money back.

314
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.

315
Although it's also about the wedding.

316
Ugh. All right, here. No. Oh, God.

317
If I haven't said so already,
sir, congratulations.

318
Okay, look, enough, all right?

319
I'm stepping in
and putting my foot down.

320
As your future husband,
I'm gonna make this decision for us.

321
What do you think we should do?

322
- It's not your decision anymore.
- What?

323
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.

324
- But we're giving you this.
- And I'm giving it back to you.

325
Come on. Consider it a contribution.

326
Well, this is very generous.

327
Please, take the check.

328
Go have a great wedding
and a wonderful life together.

329
Sounds good to me. We can save up,
come back...

330
- ...and make an even bigger donation.
- Absolutely.

331
And when you do, ask for Brian.

332
- Oh, is that you?
- No.

333
Hello?

334
Oh, hi.

335
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.

336
Okay. Goodbye.

337
- Wrong number?
- That was Laura.

338
She gave us a great report and
we're officially on the waiting list.

339
- That's great.
- Now we just wait for a call...

340
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us. Oh.

341
Hello?

342
Have you seen Joey's bat?

343
Okay. I got a spider.

344
There were two, I picked the bigger one.

345
- Okay.
- Okay.

346
This feels perfectly normal.

347
Okay, get on the swing.

348
Okay.

349
Okay.

350
Oh, okay.

351
Wow. Whoa.

352
- See?
- All right. I can do this.

353
There you go. Good for you.

354
You know what?
I'm getting used to this little guy.

355
- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
- That's because he's on your neck.

356
Whoa! Ross!

﻿1
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
Uh, we need to talk
about something.

4
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

5
- What?
- Are you kidding?

6
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

7
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

8
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

9
That doesn't sound like you.

10
That's Monica talking.

11
No, no. We made this decision together.

12
She's putting words in your mouth.

13
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

14
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

15
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

16
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

17
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

18
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

19
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am I? Really? Am I?

20
Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving
dinner and prove me wrong.

21
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

22
You'd be in competition with yourself.

23
That's my favorite kind.

24
Okay, we are doing this.

25
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

26
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

27
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

28
Did you not watch
the Dr. Phil I taped for you?

29
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

30
Oh, yeah.
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

31
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

32
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

33
No, I don't make chocolate pies.

34
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

35
I ate so many that the thought
of them makes me sick.

36
Did you at least win the contest?

37
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

38
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

39
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

40
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

41
Um, what's Emma doing today?

42
Well, let's see, uh, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

43
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

44
- Why?
- Well, I want to enter her...

45
...in a baby beauty pageant.

46
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

47
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

48
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

49
- Agh. Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

50
No. Ugh, Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

51
...I mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

52
- And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.

53
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

54
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

55
Okay. Oh, and Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

56
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

57
- Well, I was thinking...
- Take the clothes...

58
...off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
- Yeah!

59
Did someone drop the baton again?

60
Why come all the way
from Kansas to do that?

61
I don't get older, I just get better.

62
You know what just occurred to me?

63
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

64
I mean, we could be
getting a baby soon.

65
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

66
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

67
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

68
Next year, it's gonna be
you, me and little Hemingway Bing.

69
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

70
The Firm?

71
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

72
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

73
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

74
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

75
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

76
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

77
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

78
Tell me more.

79
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

80
Not with soap!

81
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

82
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

83
- Dude, I wanted him to guess.
- Oh.

84
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

85
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

86
Did I do something to you?

87
- Mm. The game's at 1.
- So?

88
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- We leave before it's over. We'll be back.

89
You say that, but it could take us
a long time to get home.

90
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

91
Dude, two times that happened!

92
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

93
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

94
He's right, man.

95
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

96
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

97
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

98
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

99
We're still going to the game.

100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

101
This is contestant number 16,
Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.

102
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

103
This place is freaking me out.

104
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

105
But we can't leave now.

106
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

107
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

108
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

109
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

110
I just saw a 1 -year-old
run around with pantyhose on.

111
Oh, I know.
We should've been more prepared.

112
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

113
My God, they just took her sweater off.

114
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

115
- Oh, Phoebe.
- Whoo-hoo.

116
Come on!
You know what, it's already 3:00.

117
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

118
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

119
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Ahem. Okay.

120
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

121
I overheard one judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

122
- Really?
- Yeah.

123
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

124
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

125
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

126
What? No... What?

127
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

128
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

129
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

130
- Oh! You bum! Get off the ice!
- You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!

131
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

132
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

133
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

134
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

135
Oh!

136
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

137
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...

138
...I was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

139
Whoa, we'd better get going.
If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.

140
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.

141
Let's just stay for one more goal.

142
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

143
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

145
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

146
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

147
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

148
- Wow.
- Here.

149
Yeah. Okay.

150
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

151
We could just slip in, and no one
needs to know where we were.

152
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

153
You just want to put it on your hand.

154
- Hey.
- Oh.

155
You...? You're not at Thanksgiving?

156
- No.
- No, we're late.

157
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

158
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

159
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

160
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

161
- Well... Uh...
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

162
- Uh, well, uh...
- We were at a spelling bee.

163
And I won.

164
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

165
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

166
Let me see this.

167
"Grand Supreme Little Darling,
New York Division"?

168
That's me. Heh.

169
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

170
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

171
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

172
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

173
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

174
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

175
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

176
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

177
- What are we gonna do?
- Figure it out.

178
I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

179
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

180
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- Ooh!

181
We'll say that we were mugged.

182
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

183
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

184
No. Here.

185
Hey!

186
Do you hear something?

187
They're out there.

188
Let me see.

189
I can't believe this. They're an hour late...

190
...and they're just
standing out there talking.

191
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

192
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

193
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

194
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

195
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

196
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

197
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

198
Hey, ooh! How about this?

199
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

200
Or!

201
Or we could plant PCP in the apartment
and call the cops on her.

202
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

203
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

204
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

205
"We know you're out there."

206
Who do you think it's from?

207
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

208
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

209
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

210
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

211
I have an idea.
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

212
Whoever loses, goes in first.

213
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

214
Ha, ha! I win.

215
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

216
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

217
- Pop-pssh.
- Aw.

218
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

219
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

220
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

221
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

222
When they're having sex on the couch,
it's like:

223
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

224
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

225
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

226
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

227
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's...

228
What happens to cranberry sauce?

229
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

230
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

231
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

232
For the love of God, take it off!

233
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

234
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

235
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

236
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

237
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

238
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

239
Ah, oh! I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

240
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

241
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

242
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

243
- Ah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

244
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

245
That's worse than no food.

246
Ha, ha! All you got was
Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.

247
Stinky?

248
Please let me stay on this side
of the door.

249
Oh, I know! I still have my old key.

250
- Oh.
- We can just unlock the door.

251
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

252
I don't wanna be with them either...

253
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

254
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology.

255
Look them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

256
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

257
...I can do it.

258
Yeah, he can do it.

259
Oh...

260
Aw. It all looks so beautiful.

261
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

262
Ugh, enough!
A monkey could've made them.

263
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

264
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

265
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

266
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

267
Right, guys?

268
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

269
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

270
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

271
The floating heads
do make a good point.

272
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

273
- So bad.
- So bad.

274
So bad.

275
Okay.

276
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

277
Dessert?

278
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

279
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

280
Here.

281
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

282
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

283
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

284
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

285
Really, girls, not cool.

286
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

287
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

288
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

289
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

290
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

291
It's too late for apologies.

292
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

293
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

294
- Ew, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

295
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

296
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

297
Hey!

298
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

299
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

300
- Uh-oh. I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

301
No, seriously. Unh.

302
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

303
Okay.

304
Ow! Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

305
It's a little late for that.

306
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

307
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

308
We need to get something
to grease his face.

309
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

310
I just want to say that I'm sorry I
referred to the vein as a separate person.

311
Here you go.

312
Oh, that smells good.

313
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

314
Gah! It isn't working.

315
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

316
Can you ever feel your ears?

317
Interesting.

318
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

319
I don't have tools.

320
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

321
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

322
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

323
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

324
Nice.

325
Okay, I have to get that.

326
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

327
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

328
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

329
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

330
Okay, so push.

331
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

332
Ooh, ooh. Stop putting things
down my pants.

333
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

334
Push! Push!

335
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

336
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

337
Look! Look! Look what the...
Look what the floating heads did!

338
I don't care.

339
What's going on?

340
That was the adoption agency.

341
And?

342
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?

343
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

344
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

345
I'm so happy for you.

346
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

347
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

348
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

349
I know. Have you considered pageanting?

350
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

351
Aw. I know how you feel.

352
- Really?
- Sure.

353
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

354
The waiting, the wondering.

355
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys "R" Us.

356
She was in stock.

357
That is the exact same thing.

﻿1
Hey.

2
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

4
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

5
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

6
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

7
And so incorrect.

8
She's only a couple months pregnant.

9
She liked our application,
who knows if she'll like us.

10
Oh, come on, she's gonna
love you guys.

11
Oh, thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

12
A lot could still get in our way.

13
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

14
What are you gonna name it?

15
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk, and no one hears a word.

16
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

17
What if this woman does pick you guys?

18
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

19
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

20
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

21
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

22
- Yes. But...
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

23
We're gonna make it work!

24
I'm gonna be a mommy
and you're gonna be a daddy!

25
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

26
Oh, screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

27
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

28
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

29
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
- So, uh, who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

31
No. Don't you get any ideas.

32
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

33
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

34
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

35
Oh! Name one friend of yours
I did that with.

36
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh? Uh...

37
Really hot blond, big boobs?

38
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember her, huh?

39
Do you think I'm someone else?

40
Okay, look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

41
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

42
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

43
I mean, when Joey and I were together...

44
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

45
And for the one week
that we went out...

46
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

47
Growth.

48
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

49
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

50
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

51
Sarah.

52
- Hey.
- Hi.

53
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

54
Oh. Huh.

55
How does this look?

56
Well, it's... It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

57
A little bit more.

58
There you go.

59
Now throw it away.

60
Come on! This looks good.

61
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

62
Now, I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

63
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

64
Damn it. God...

65
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

66
If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
are going shopping tomorrow.

67
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

68
Uh, I mean, I have to do something.

69
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

70
I can see why. Nice shirt. Ha, ha.

71
You're wearing the same shirt.

72
Stupid Gap on every corner!

73
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

74
Okay, thank you.

75
Well, this is it.

76
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

77
It's like, uh, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I
have the human growing inside you?"

78
Ooh!

79
You're gonna be great.

80
Well, obviously.

81
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

82
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

83
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

84
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

85
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

86
I only know you as
"File CRW33815-D."

87
That's what our friends call us.

88
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

89
...kind of intimidating.

90
Oh, ha, ha. I don't know about that.

91
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.

92
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

93
- I don't think that's exactly...
- Let her finish, doctor.

94
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
Oh, my friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

96
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

97
Ha, ha. No.

98
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

99
Oh, really? You wanna know
what your "great" friend did?

100
We were out to dinner, okay?

101
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

102
I was thinking she was really cool.

103
And then, out of nowhere...

104
That's it?

105
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

106
So she took some fries. Big deal.

107
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

108
It's about what the fries represent.

109
- What?
- All food!

110
Well, I'm sorry.

111
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

112
Hey, hey, hey, look, I take a girl out...

113
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

114
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

115
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

116
Oh, thank God you're here.

117
- Listen to this.
- What?

118
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

119
...and takes a few of his fries...
- Oh, no!

120
Mm-hm.
- What?

121
You know about the plate thing?

122
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, Joey doesn't share food.

123
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

124
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

125
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- Oh, no, not me.

126
Emma.

127
Joey doesn't share food!

128
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

129
You are calling her, okay?

130
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

131
I like that.

132
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

133
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

134
Yeah. Yeah.

135
And a shrimp cocktail.

136
Uh-huh. And some Buffalo wings.

137
Maybe...
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

138
And some mozzarella sticks.

139
What were we talking about?

140
Wow, this place is awesome.

141
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

142
This stuff is ridiculous.

143
Oh, this place is great!

144
Wow.

145
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

146
- Wha...?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

147
- And nothing with padlocks on it!
- Aw.

148
Ross, look. Look, I know that
some of this stuff is out there.

149
But, I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

150
I mean, this is just beautiful.

151
Wow, this is really soft.

152
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

153
Down from 700.
You're saving like 200 bucks.

154
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

155
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

156
- Wow.
- Yeah.

157
Huh.

158
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

159
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

160
"Boys will be boys"?

161
- What? They will be!
- All right.

162
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

163
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

164
Huh. Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

165
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

166
I know your size, and I'm gonna pick out
some really good stuff for you.

167
- Really?
- Yes.

168
I know what looks sexy on guys.

169
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

170
So you're saying, uh...

171
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

172
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

173
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

174
...that's important to you?

175
Yeah. I read some great applications...

176
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

177
Amen.

178
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

179
Oh, good hands.

180
Healing hands.

181
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

182
It says, "Do it."

183
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

184
And it was good."

185
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

186
I was wondering...
You both have such serious jobs.

187
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

188
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

189
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

190
It's a good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

191
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

192
Not for me it doesn't.

193
So how's everything going in here?

194
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

195
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

196
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...

197
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

198
Oh, yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

199
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

200
You're really on top of stuff.

201
Well, then if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

202
I actually...

203
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

204
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

205
...but I just thought we should meet
face to face.

206
I've made my decision.

207
I choose them. Heh.

208
Oh, my God, this is great.

209
This is so great. Did you hear that?

210
Yeah, I did.

211
Okay.

212
- Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh.
- Ha, ha.

213
Oh. You are so going to heaven!

214
- Oh, we got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

215
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
of the bras I got.

216
Oh, really? Do you wanna try
some of them on for me?

217
Oh, okay.

218
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

219
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

220
And one of mine is missing.

221
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

222
So, what do you think?

223
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

224
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

225
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

226
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

227
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

228
Oh, I see.

229
Somebody's afraid of a little competition
with the ladies?

230
Looks like someone is the ladies!

231
You're just jealous
because you couldn't pull this off.

232
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

233
See? All eyes on me!

234
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

235
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

236
God works in mysterious ways.

237
You have gotta stop.

238
But she liked us.

239
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

240
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

241
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

242
Your veal chop is 34.95.

243
Come on, I just...
I think we've been given an opportunity.

244
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

245
But we're not the ones she chose.

246
How can you feel okay about this?

247
Because.

248
We may not be who she thinks we are...

249
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

250
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

251
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

252
What if no one ever picks us?

253
Oh, honey...

254
Please?

255
Please. We are so close.

256
Monica, I want a baby too.

257
But this woman is giving away her child.

258
She deserves to know who it's going to.

259
Okay. You're right.

260
So we'll tell the truth.

261
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

262
Maybe she will.

263
Oh, why couldn't I
have been a reverend?

264
You're Jewish.

265
Technicality!

266
Garden salad for the lady.

267
- Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Ha-ha-ha.

268
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

269
- Enjoy.
- Ha, ha.

270
Mm. Those fries look delicious.

271
- Oh, I didn't know you liked french fries.
- Ha, ha.

272
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

273
Oh. Wow, are those stuffed clams?

274
Uh...

275
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

276
How about those fries, though, huh?

277
- They are delicious. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

278
You are beautiful, you know that?

279
That is so sweet.

280
Okay, then.

281
Mm.

282
Mm-hm.

283
Now look what you did!

284
What? What is the matter with you?

285
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

286
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

287
Well, I didn't mean it!

288
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

289
No, I'm sorry. I...

290
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, I...

291
...have certain rules...

292
...okay? I mean...

293
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

294
Wow, this place looks great.

295
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

296
- Me too.
- Here.

297
So this was fun.

298
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

299
And I wanna make sure you know
I really do like you.

300
Sure, just not as much as clams.

301
Well, stuffed clams, ha, ha...

302
- Chocolate torte for the lady.
- Mm.

303
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

304
Uh, excuse me, sir. There seems to be
some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

305
Oh. Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

306
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

307
Oh, my God. Mm.

308
- I'll just have what she's having.
- I'm sorry, sir.

309
- That was our last piece.
- Mm.

310
Mm. Mm.

311
Oh, no.

312
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

313
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.

314
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

315
Sure I do.

316
- Coulis?
- Ha, ha.

317
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

318
This is a two-way street.

319
Really?

320
Really.

321
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

322
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

323
Stop staring at me!

324
Just a tiny little... Ha, ha.

325
Uh-oh.

326
I'm not even sorry.

327
- Hi.
- Hey.

328
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption. Uh...

329
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

330
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

331
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

332
I thought you might wanna see it.

333
Look, doctor.

334
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

335
We're not who you think we are.

336
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

337
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

338
- What?
- That's impossible.

339
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

340
Um, I have to check your file. Excuse me.

341
So who are you?

342
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

343
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

344
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

345
So you lied to me before?

346
Well, we "bore false witness."

347
See? I could be a reverend.

348
I can't believe this.

349
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

350
...that you still might consider...
- Giving you my baby?

351
You think I'd give you my child
after this?

352
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file...

353
I don't wanna look at your file.
This is over.

354
Erica, wait.

355
I have nothing to say to you.

356
Look, you have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.

357
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

358
And we don't know how long it's gonna be
before we get another chance.

359
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

360
Erica, please.

361
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

362
Our last name's Bing.

363
My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.

364
Oh, yeah.

365
I actually liked you guys.

366
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

367
But you did like us.

368
And you should.

369
My wife's an incredible woman.

370
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

371
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

372
I love my wife more than anything
in this world.

373
And it...

374
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

375
I really want a kid.

376
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

377
But my wife...

378
...she's already there.

379
She's a mother...

380
...without a baby.

381
Please?

382
You still want that baby?

383
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

384
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

385
So why are you still wearing it?

386
Because it's soft.

387
- Hey, so how was your date?
- Ugh.

388
Not so good.

389
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

390
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

391
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

392
Joey doesn't share food!
